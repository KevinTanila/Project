Both figures are likely to be higher, due to differing test rates, definitions and deliberate underreporting.\n\nUS bars travellers who have been in Brazil in last two weeks\n\nThe White House has announced it is prohibiting foreigners from traveling to the US if they had been in Brazil in the last two weeks, two days after the South American nation became the world\u2019s second-worst affected country in terms of coronavirus cases. Brazil meanwhile registered 15,813 new cases and 653 new deaths in 24 hours, taking the total number of fatalities to 22,666, and cases to 363,211 confirmed cases, the Health Ministry said.\n\nWhite House official likens China\u2019s handling of coronavirus to Chernobyl cover-up\n\nA top White House official on Sunday likened China\u2019s handling of the coronavirus outbreak to the Soviet Union\u2019s cover-up of the meltdown at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in 1986. Robert O\u2019Brien, Donald Trump\u2019s national security adviser, accused China of a cover-up that will \u201cgo down in history along with Chernobyl\u201d, ramping up efforts to deflect attention from a Covid-19 death toll in the US fast closing on 100,000.\n\nChina says virus pushing US ties to brink of \u2018Cold War\u2019\n\nChinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said Sunday that Washington seemed infected by a \u201cpolitical virus\u201d but that Beijing would nevertheless be open to an international effort to find the coronavirus source.\u201cSome political forces in the US are taking China-US relations hostage and pushing our two countries to the brink of a new Cold War,\u201d Wang said.\n\nDominic Cummings reported to police over lockdown breach\n\nBoris Johnson\u2019s chief advisor is facing a possible police investigation under health laws over a claim that he breached self-isolation rules in north-east England, after a weekend of mounting pressure on the prime minister to sack his chief adviser.\n\nBoris Johnson described Cummings as acting \u201cresponsibly, legally and with integrity\u201d.\n\nFirst Spanish beaches to reopen as lockdown eases\n\nCoronavirus lockdown measures will finally be eased for people in Madrid and Barcelona from Monday, while elsewhere in Spain the first beaches are due to reopen, AFP reports. Residents in the two cities can now meet in groups of up to 10 people in their homes or on the terraces of bars and restaurants. The gates of the capital\u2019s parks will also be reopened, and major museums will be able to receive a limited number of visitors.\n\nAustralian children return to school\n\nAustralia\u2019s most populous state, New South Wales, on Monday deployed hundreds of crowd control staff to enforce social distancing on public transport amid an expected commuter surge as schools and offices reopened and coronavirus cases fell.

A key question is whether antibodies produced by the body following an infection with the coronavirus provide some level of immunity, and if so, for how long.\n\nBut we do have some clues. \u201cWe know from \u2018normal\u2019 coronavirus studies done in the past you can infect people after about a year following an initial infection,\u201d said Dr Ben Killingley, consultant in acute medicine and infectious diseases at University College London hospital.\n\nDr Joshua Schiffer, an expert in infectious diseases at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in the US, added that any signs of reinfection would require detailed scrutiny.\n\n\u201cI have yet to see a definitive case of reinfection reported in the scientific literature [to date]. To truly prove reinfection, and discriminate from prolonged viral shedding related to the first infection, would require sequencing of both the first and second viruses and demonstration that the two viruses are genetically different,\u201d he said, adding it will also be important to look at symptoms and how long reinfection lasts.\n\n\u201cIt is also important to recognise that documentation of one or a handful of reinfections does not prove that this is a common, epidemiologically important event.\u201d\n\nWhat happened in South Korea, where patients tested positive after having recovered from Covid-19?\n\nThis initially caused concerns, as experts feared the results might suggest patients had been reinfected. However, the World Health Organization has since said the results were actually false positives, a result of the test picking up particles of the virus within dead lung cells \u2013 but this is not active virus. That\u2019s because the PCR (or \u201chave-you-got-it\u201d) test is based on detecting genetic material from the virus \u2013 on its own it does not reveal whether that virus is active, and infectious, or not.\n\nWhy do some people have long-lasting symptoms?\n\nSome people with Covid-19 experience complications following an initial infection.\n\n\u201cIn some persons they begin to feel well again and signs and symptoms including fever decrease, but some then go on to develop respiratory distress and must be provided oxygen in hospital,\u201d said David Heymann, professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. \u201cIt appears to be a delayed immune response that is more serious in some persons and that reacts to remaining virus in various organs.\u201d\n\nEven some people who have had a mild experience of Covid-19 have reported experiencing symptoms for several weeks or even months, although experts say only time and testing will tell what the long-term implications are and how common this is.\n\nLingering and painful: the long and unclear road to coronavirus recovery Read more\n\nKillingley said it was unclear what was behind such ongoing symptoms, but there are a range of possibilities \u2013 including inflammation caused by the virus \u2013 although the mechanisms and risks are, as yet, unclear.\n\nImmunology professor Daniel Altmann, of Imperial College London, said such cases are important to study.\n\n\u201c[We are] at the beginning of describing what may be a complex picture of chronic disease that may ensue from the initial infection \u2013 coming and going in relapsing waves, sometimes almost like a kind of chronic fatigue syndrome,\u201d he said. \u201c[These cases] may reflect examples of virus not fully cleared, or alternatively, some kind of damaging post-hoc disturbance to immune or inflammatory function,\u201d he said.\n\nSchiffer agreed such cases are cause for concern. \u201cIn the case of Sars CoV-2, my colleagues and I are particularly worried about the possibility of prolonged periods of lung inflammation and/or scarring,\u201d he said.\n\nCould the coronavirus lie dormant in the body, and then reactivate?\n\nExperts say it is unlikely. \u201cI know some have discussed \u2018reactivation\u2019 of virus, but this seems unhelpful and unsupported to me,\u201d said Altmann. \u201cIt\u2019s a term that\u2019s borrowed from other viruses, especially the herpes virus family, that can hide in the body in a latent state to reactivate years later. [There is] no evidence of that at all for coronaviruses.\u201d\n\nHow long are people with Covid-19 infectious for?\n\nA recent study of 60 coronavirus patients in China showed 10 patients tested positive for Covid-19 after discharge from hospital. However, once again, experts say this could be down to the test picking up genetic material from inactive virus, with other studies, including work in South Korea, suggesting those who test positive with Covid-19 after recovering from the disease are not infectious.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not uncommon to find virus in the nose or throat for up to four weeks after initial infection, but tests to establish whether this is live infectious virus \u2013 as opposed to just genetic material detection \u2013 are not normally positive for much longer than a week,\u201d said Killingley, adding: \u201cI haven\u2019t come across relapse cases whereby the initial infection acquired weeks ago reignites itself into an infectious case.\u201d\n\nSchiffer had doubts: \u201cIn my view, the presence of Sars CoV-2 RNA many weeks after initial infection may represent ongoing viral replication in cells, which also implies the persistence of small amounts of \u201cactive\u201d virus,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, quantities are tiny and may represent the dying embers of infection in the body.\u201d\n\nAltmann said that, asymptomatic cases aside, infectiousness correlates strongly with acute symptoms, which typically last for up to 12 days, with a tailout to 28 days. \u201cMy sense is that in the people who are feeling unwell long after this, it may not be virus, but some kind of immune or inflammatory perturbation,\u201d he said.", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/24/explainer-what-do-we-now-know-about-covid-19-and-can-you-get-it-twice", "published": "2020-05-24T00:00:00", "author": ["Nicola Davis"]}, {"title": "Why we might not get a coronavirus vaccine", "text": "Politicians have become more cautious about immunisation prospects. They are right to be\n\nIt would be hard to overstate the importance of developing a vaccine to Sars-CoV-2 \u2013 it\u2019s seen as the fast track to a return to normal life. That\u2019s why the health secretary, Matt Hancock, said the UK was \u201cthrowing everything at it\u201d.\n\nBut while trials have been launched and manufacturing deals already signed \u2013 Oxford University is now recruiting 10,000 volunteers for the next phase of its research \u2013 ministers and their advisers have become noticeably more cautious in recent days.\n\nThis is why.\n\nWhy might a vaccine fail?\n\nEarlier this week, England\u2019s deputy chief medical officer Jonathan Van-Tam said the words nobody wanted to hear: \u201cWe can\u2019t be sure we will get a vaccine.\u201d\n\nBut he was right to be circumspect.\n\nVaccines are simple in principle but complex in practice. The ideal vaccine protects against infection, prevents its spread, and does so safely. But none of this is easily achieved, as vaccine timelines show.\n\nMore than 30 years after scientists isolated HIV, the virus that causes Aids, we have no vaccine. The dengue fever virus was identified in 1943, but the first vaccine was approved only last year, and even then amid concerns it made the infection worse in some people. The fastest vaccine ever developed was for mumps. It took four years.\n\nScientists have worked on coronavirus vaccines before, so are not starting from scratch. Two coronaviruses have caused lethal outbreaks before, namely Sars and Mers, and vaccine research went ahead for both. But none have been licensed, partly because Sars fizzled out and Mers is regional to the Middle East. The lessons learned will help scientists create a vaccine for Sars-CoV-2, but there is still an awful lot to learn about the virus.\n\nA chief concern is that coronaviruses do not tend to trigger long-lasting immunity. About a quarter of common colds are caused by human coronaviruses, but the immune response fades so rapidly that people can become reinfected the next year.\n\nResearchers at Oxford University recently analysed blood from recovered Covid-19 patients and found that levels of IgG antibodies \u2013 those responsible for longer-lasting immunity \u2013 rose steeply in the first month of infection but then began to fall again.\n\nLast week, scientists at Rockefeller University in New York found that most people who recovered from Covid-19 without going into hospital did not make many killer antibodies against the virus.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what is particularly challenging,\u201d says Stanley Perlman, a veteran coronavirus researcher at the University of Iowa. \u201cIf the natural infection doesn\u2019t give you that much immunity except when it\u2019s a severe infection, what will a vaccine do? It could be better, but we don\u2019t know.\u201d If a vaccine only protects for a year, the virus will be with us for some time.\n\nThe genetic stability of the virus matters too. Some viruses, such as influenza, mutate so rapidly that vaccine developers have to release new formulations each year. The rapid evolution of HIV is a major reason we have no vaccine for the disease.\n\nSo far, the Sars-CoV-2 coronavirus seems fairly stable, but it is acquiring mutations, as all viruses do. Some genetic changes have been spotted in the virus\u2019s protein \u201cspikes\u201d which are the basis of most vaccines. If the spike protein mutates too much, the antibodies produced by a vaccine will effectively be out of date and might not bind the virus effectively enough to prevent infection.\n\nMartin Hibberd, professor of emerging infectious diseases at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, who helped identify some of the virus\u2019s mutations, called them \u201can early warning\u201d.\n\nAnother challenge: making any vaccine safe\n\nIn the rush to develop a vaccine \u2013 there are now more than 100 in development \u2013 safety must remain a priority. Unlike experimental drugs for the severely ill, the vaccine will be given to potentially billions of generally healthy people.\n\nThis means scientists will have to check extremely carefully for signs of dangerous side-effects. During the search for a Sars vaccine in 2004, scientists found that one candidate caused hepatitis in ferrets. Another serious concern is \u201cantibody-induced enhancement\u201d where the antibodies produced by a vaccine actually make future infections worse. The effect caused serious lung damage in animals given experimental vaccines for both Sars and Mers.\n\nJohn McCauley, director of the Worldwide Influenza Centre at the Francis Crick Institute, says it takes time to understand the particular challenges each vaccine throws up. \u201cYou don\u2019t know the difficulties, the specific difficulties, that every vaccine will give you,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd we haven\u2019t got experience in handling this virus or the components of the virus.\u201d\n\nWe should \u2018end up with something\u2019 \u2026 but what does that mean?\n\nWhen the prime minister, Boris Johnson, told a No 10 press briefing that a vaccine was \u201cby no means guaranteed\u201d, his chief scientific adviser, Patrick Vallance, agreed, but added: \u201cI\u2019d be surprised if we didn\u2019t end up with something.\u201d Many scientists share that view.\n\nIn all likelihood, a coronavirus vaccine will not be 100% effective.\n\nThose in development draw on at least eight different approaches, from weakened and inactivated viruses to technologies that smuggle genetic code into the recipient\u2019s cells, which then churn out spike proteins for the immune system to make antibodies against.\n\nIdeally, a vaccine will generate persistent, high levels of antibodies to wipe out the virus and also \u201cT\u201d cells to destroy infected cells. But each vaccine is different and today no one knows what kind of immune response is good enough.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t even know if a vaccine can produce an immune response which would protect against future infection,\u201d says David Heymann, who led the response of the World Health Organization (WHO) to the Sars epidemic.\n\nEarly results from two frontrunner vaccines suggest they might have some use.\n\nThe US biotech firm Moderna reported antibody levels similar to those found in recovered patients in 25 people who received its vaccine.\n\nAnother vaccine from Oxford University did not stop monkeys contracting the virus, but did appear to prevent pneumonia, a major cause of death in coronavirus patients.\n\nIf humans react the same way, vaccinated people would still spread the virus, but be less likely to die from it.\n\nHow well a vaccine works determines how it is used. Armed with a highly effective vaccine that protects for several years, countries could aim for herd immunity by protecting at least two-thirds of the population.\n\nCoronavirus patients pass the virus on to three others, on average, but if two or more are immune, the outbreak will fizzle out. That is the best-case scenario.\n\nMore likely is we will end up with a vaccine, or a number of vaccines, that are only partially effective.\n\nVaccines that contain weakened strains of virus can be dangerous for older people, but might be given to younger people with more robust immune systems to reduce the spread of infection.\n\nMeanwhile, older people might get vaccines that simple prevent infections progressing to life-threatening pneumonia. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have the ability to induce immunity, you\u2019ve got to develop a strategy for reducing serious outcomes of infection,\u201d says McCauley.\n\nBut partially effective vaccines have their own problems: a vaccine that doesn\u2019t stop the virus replicating can encourage resistant strains to evolve, making the vaccine redundant.\n\nSo, is the virus here to stay?\n\nThe simple answer is: yes.\n\nHopes for eliminating the virus start with a vaccine but do not end there. \u201cIf and when we have a vaccine, what you get is not rainbows and unicorns,\u201d says Larry Brilliant, CEO of Pandefense Advisory, who led the WHO\u2019s smallpox eradication programme. \u201cIf we are forced to choose a vaccine that gives only one year of protection, then we are doomed to have Covid become endemic, an infection that is always with us.\u201d\n\nThe virus will still be tough to conquer with a vaccine that lasts for years.\n\n\u201cIt will be harder to get rid of Covid than smallpox,\u201d says Brilliant. With smallpox it was at least clear who was infected, whereas people with coronavirus can spread it without knowing. A thornier problem is that as long as the infection rages in one country, all other nations are at risk.\n\nAs David Salisbury, the former director of immunisation at the Department of Health, told a Chatham House webinar recently: \u201cUnless we have a vaccine available in unbelievable quantities that could be administered extraordinarily quickly in all communities in the world we will have gaps in our defences that the virus can continue to circulate in.\u201d\n\nOr as Brilliant puts it, the virus will \u201cping-pong back and forth in time and geography\u201d.\n\nOne proposal from Gavi, the vaccine alliance, is to boost the availability of vaccines around the world through an \u201cadvance market commitment\u201d. And Brilliant believes some kind of global agreement must be hammered out now. \u201cWe should be demanding, now, a global conference on what we\u2019re going to do when we get a vaccine, or if we don\u2019t,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cIf the process of getting a vaccine, testing it, proving it, manufacturing it, planning for its delivery, and building a vaccine programme all over the world, if that\u2019s going to take as long as we think, then let\u2019s fucking start planning it now.\u201d\n\nHow will we live with the virus?\n\nPeople will have to adapt \u2013 and life will change. Heymann says we will have to get used to extensive monitoring for infections backed up by swift outbreak containment. People must play their part too, by maintaining handwashing, physical distancing and avoiding gatherings, particularly in enclosed spaces. Repurposed drugs are faster to test than vaccines, so we may have an antiviral or an antibody treatment that works before a vaccine is available, he adds. Immediate treatment when symptoms come on could at least reduce the death rate.\n\nYuen Kwok-yung, a professor of infectious disease at the University of Hong Kong, has advised his government that all social distancing can be relaxed \u2013 but only if people wear masks in enclosed spaces such as on trains and at work, and that no food or drink are consumed at concerts and cinemas.\n\nAt restaurants, tables will have to be shielded from each other and serving staff will follow strict rules to prevent spreading the virus. \u201cIn our Hong Kong perspective, the diligent and correct use of reusable masks is the most important measure,\u201d he says.\n\nSarita Jane Robinson, a psychologist who studies responses to threats at the University of Central Lancashire, says people are still adapting to the \u201cnew normal\u201d and that without more interventions \u2013 such as fines for not wearing face masks \u2013 \u201cwe could see people drifting back to old behaviours\u201d.\n\nWe might become blase about Covid-19 deaths when life resumes and the media move on, but the seriousness of the illness will make it harder to ignore, she says.\n\nHas the coronavirus pandemic made us all nicer? Read more\n\nOne last possibility could save a lot of trouble. Some scientists wonder whether the common cold coronaviruses crossed into humans in the distant past and caused similar illness before settling down. \u201cIf the virus doesn\u2019t change there\u2019s no reason to think that miraculously in five years\u2019 time it won\u2019t still cause pneumonia,\u201d says Perlman. \u201cBut that\u2019s the hope: that we end up with a much more mild disease and you only get a bad cold from it.\u201d\n\nHeymann says it is too soon to know how the pandemic will pan out. \u201cWe don\u2019t understand the destiny of this virus,\u201d he says. \u201cWill it continue to circulate after its first pandemic? Or will it, like some other pandemic viruses, disappear or become less virulent?

Scientists said the results meant the drug should no longer be given to Covid-19 patients except in proper research settings.\n\nWhile the paper, published online in the Lancet medical journal, is not a trial designed to assess the drug, it shows that the rush to use it around the world may be ill-advised. Significant numbers of doctors have been prescribing it without evidence. It is known that the drug can cause heart irregularities, but many have claimed it is safe because of its long use treating malaria.\n\nHydroxychloroquine, Trump and Covid-19: what you need to know Read more\n\nThere was a rush to use the drug in Covid-19 cases after the French doctor Didier Raoult said he was curing his patients at La Timone hospital, in Marseille. The US president then claimed hydroxychloroquine \u2013 less toxic than the original chloroquine \u2013 was a cure, and later said he was taking it himself against coronavirus.\n\nThe drugs are fairly safe for patients being treated for malaria, but Covid-19 is a very different disease. The authors of the paper pulled together results for more than 96,000 patients in 671 hospitals, taking one of the drugs, with or without an antibiotic such as azithromycin, between 20 December and 14 April.\n\nThe death rate among all groups taking the drugs was higher than among people who were not given them. One in six of those taking one of the drugs died, while one in five died if they were taking chloroquine with an antibiotic, and one in four if they were on hydroxychloroquine and an antibiotic. The death rate among patients not taking the drugs was one in 11.\n\nPlay Video 1:12 'An individual decision': Trump defends taking unproved coronavirus drug hydroxychloroquine \u2013 video\n\nThe statistics are not exactly comparable because, as this was not a trial, there were differences in the age, gender, general health and stage of illness of the patients. But the US authors of the study say, allowing for these differences, there was still higher mortality among those taking the drugs.\n\nThe team also found that serious cardiac arrhythmias, which cause the lower chamber of the heart to beat rapidly and irregularly, were more common in all the groups receiving one of the four treatment regimens. The biggest increase was in the group treated with hydroxychloroquine in combination with an antibiotic, where 8% of patients developed a heart arrhythmia compared with 0.3% of patients not given the drugs.\n\n\u201cThis is the first large-scale study to find statistically robust evidence that treatment with chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine does not benefit patients with Covid-19,\u201d said Prof Mandeep R Mehra, lead author of the study and executive director of the Brigham and Women\u2019s hospital advanced heart disease center in Boston, US.\n\n\u201cInstead, our findings suggest it may be associated with an increased risk of serious heart problems and increased risk of death. Randomised clinical trials are essential to confirm any harms or benefits associated with these agents. In the meantime, we suggest these drugs should not be used as treatments for Covid-19 outside of clinical trials.\u201d\n\nOthers scientists suggested the drugs should no longer be used in Covid-19 treatments, except for carefully controlled clinical trials.\n\nHydroxychloroquine and coronavirus: a guide to the scientific studies so far Read more\n\nDr Stephen Griffin, associate professor in the school of medicine, University of Leeds, said the paper was \u201cpotentially a landmark study for Covid-19 therapy. While not a placebo-controlled trial, an observational study on this scale undertaken with stringent and meticulous analysis is powerful indeed,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhilst controlled trials will be required for confident affirmation, the indications are that these drugs certainly ought not to be used outside of a trial setting where patients can be monitored for complications. One might also question whether the resources necessary for large studies might be better diverted to other causes, at the same time allowing the drugs themselves to be used for their original purpose.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, it is clear that high-profile endorsements of taking these drugs without clinical oversight are both misguided and irresponsible.\u201d\n\nStephen Evans, professor of pharmacoepidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said it was unlikely that trials would now find any substantial benefit from the drugs. \u201cA definitive answer still awaits the results of the randomised trials, but it is clear that the drugs should not be given for treatment of Covid-19 other than in the context of a randomised trial.\n\n\u201cIt might even be said that to go on giving them, other than in a trial, is unethical, given this evidence that is not yet contradicted by other available evidence.\u201d", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/may/22/hydroxychloroquine-trumps-covid-19-cure-increases-deaths-global-study-finds", "published": "2020-05-22T00:00:00", "author": ["Sarah Boseley"]}, {"title": "The Guide: Staying In \u2013 sign up for our home entertainment tips", "text": "Entertainment delivered straight to your sofa.

Was it really Wuhan\u2019s animal market?", "text": "In the public mind, the origin story of coronavirus seems well fixed: in late 2019 someone at the now world-famous Huanan seafood market in Wuhan was infected with a virus from an animal.\n\nThe rest is part of an awful history still in the making, with Covid-19 spreading from that first cluster in the capital of China\u2019s Hubei province to a pandemic that has killed about 211,000 people so far.\n\nStock footage of pangolins \u2013 a scaly mammal that looks like an anteater \u2013 have made it on to news bulletins, suggesting this animal was the staging post for the virus before it spread to humans.\n\nBut there is uncertainty about several aspects of the Covid-19 origin story that scientists are trying hard to unravel, including which species passed it to a human. They\u2019re trying hard because knowing how a pandemic starts is a key to stopping the next one.\n\nProf Stephen Turner, head of the department of microbiology at Melbourne\u2019s Monash University, says what\u2019s most likely is that virus originated in bats.\n\nBut that\u2019s where his certainty ends, he says.\n\nOn the hypothesis that the virus emerged at the Wuhan live animal market from an interaction between an animal and a human, Turner says: \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s conclusive by any means.\u201d\n\n\u201cPart of the problem is that the information is only as good as the surveillance,\u201d he says, adding that viruses of this type are circulating all the time in the animal kingdom.\n\nThe fact that the virus has infected a tiger in a New York zoo shows how viruses can move around between species, he says. \u201cUnderstanding the breadth of species this virus can infect is important as it helps us narrow down down where it might have come from.\u201d\n\nScientists say it is highly likely that the virus came from bats but first passed through an intermediary animal in the same way that another coronavirus \u2013 the 2002 Sars outbreak \u2013 moved from horseshoe bats to cat-like civets before infecting humans.\n\nPangolins are \u2018the most illegally traded mammal in the world\u2019. Photograph: Themba Hadebe/AP\n\nOne animal implicated as an intermediary host between bats and humans is the pangolin. The International Union for Conservation of Nature says they are \u201cthe most illegally traded mammal in the world\u201d and are prized for their meat and the claimed medicinal properties of their scales.\n\nAs reported in Nature, pangolins were not listed on the inventory of items being sold in Wuhan, although this omission could be deliberate as it\u2019s illegal to sell them.\n\n\u201cWhether the poor pangolin was the species at which it jumped, it\u2019s not clear,\u201d Turner says. \u201cIt\u2019s either mixed in something else, mixed in a poor pangolin, or it\u2019s jumped into people and evolved in people.\u201d\n\nProf Edward Holmes, of the University of Sydney, was a co-author on a Nature study that examined the likely origins of the virus by looking at its genome. On social media he has stressed that the identity of the species that served as an intermediate host for the virus is \u201cstill uncertain\u201d.\n\nOne statistical study looked at a characteristic of the virus that evolved to enable it to latch on to human cells. Pangolins were able to develop this characteristic, but so were cats, buffalo, cattle, goats, sheep and pigeons.\n\nAnother study claimed to have ruled out pangolins as an intermediary altogether, because samples of similar viruses taken from pangolins lacked a chain of amino acids seen in the virus now circulating in humans.\n\nThe study Holmes worked on suggested that the scenario in which a human at the Wuhan market interacted with an animal that carried the virus was only one potential version of the Covid-19 origin story. Another was the possibility that a descendent of the virus jumped into humans and then adapted as it was passed from human to human.\n\n\u201cOnce acquired, these adaptations would enable the pandemic to take off and produce a sufficiently large cluster of cases to trigger the surveillance system that detected it,\u201d the study said.\n\nAnalysis of the first 41 Covid-19 patients in medical journal the Lancet found that 27 of them had direct exposure to the Wuhan market. But the same analysis found that the first known case of the illness did not.\n\nThis might be another reason to doubt the established story.\n\nProf Stanley Perlman, a leading immunologist at the University of Iowa and an expert on previous coronavirus outbreaks that have stemmed from animals, says the idea the link to the Wuhan market is coincidental \u201ccannot be ruled out\u201d but that possibility \u201cseems less likely\u201d because the genetic material of the virus had been found in the market environment.\n\nPerlman told Guardian Australia he does believe there was an intermediary animal but adds that while pangolins are possible candidates, they \u201care not proven to be the key intermediary\u201d.\n\n\u201cI suspect that any evolution [of the virus] occurred in the intermediate animal if there was one. There has been no substantial changes in the virus in the three months of the pandemic, indicating that the virus is well adapted to humans.\u201d\n\nSo-called wet markets \u2013 where live animals are traded \u2013 have been implicated in previous outbreaks of coronaviruses, in particular Sars.\n\nDr Michelle Baker, an immunologist at CSIRO who studies viruses in bats, says some of the research on Covid-19\u2019s origins have stepped off from what was known from the past.\n\nBut \u201cwe really don\u2019t know\u201d how accurate the origin story is, she says: \u201cThere\u2019s some sort of connection [to the Wuhan market] and there were people exposed to the market that were infected.\u201d\n\nBaker says what is \u201cvery likely\u201d is that the virus originated in a bat. \u201cIt\u2019s a likely scenario but we will never know. The market was cleaned up quite quickly. We can only speculate.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese wet markets have been identified as an issue because you do have species interacting,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity to highlight the dangers of them and an opportunity to clamp down on them.\u201d\n\nTurner adds: \u201cWe\u2019ve found the ancestors of the virus, but having broader knowledge of the coronavirus in other species might give us a hint about the evolution of this thing and how it jumped.\u201d", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/28/how-did-the-coronavirus-start-where-did-it-come-from-how-did-it-spread-humans-was-it-really-bats-pangolins-wuhan-animal-market", "published": "2020-04-28T00:00:00", "author": ["Graham Readfearn"]}, {"title": "What is Coronavirus, what are its symptoms, and when should I call a doctor?", "text": "Why is the Covid-19 virus worse than normal influenza, and how worried are the experts?\n\nWhat is Covid-19?\n\nIt is caused by a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has transferred to humans from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.\n\nWhat are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?\n\nAccording to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.\n\nAbout one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems such as high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.\n\nIn the UK, the National Health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:\n\nA high temperature \u2013 you feel hot to touch on your chest or back.\n\nA new continuous cough \u2013 this means you have started coughing repeatedly.\n\nAs this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.\n\nPlay Video 5:59 Can you get coronavirus twice? \u2013 video explainer\n\nShould I go to the doctor if I have a temperature or a cough?\n\nNo. In the UK, the NHS advice is now that anyone with symptoms should stay at home for at least 7 days. If you live with other people, they should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home. This applies to everyone, regardless of whether they have travelled abroad.\n\nIn the UK, you should look on the dedicated coronavirus NHS 111 website for information. If you get worse or your symptoms last longer than seven days, you should call NHS 111. People will no longer be tested for the virus unless they are in hospital.\n\nMany countries have imposed travel bans and lockdown conditions in order to try to halt the spread of the virus. You should check with your local authorities for the latest advice on seeking medical assistance.\n\nHow many people have been affected?\n\nAs of 17 April, more than 2.1m people have been infected in over 185 countries, according to the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering.\n\nThere have been more than 145,000 deaths globally. Over 4,500 of those deaths have occurred in mainland China, where the coronavirus was first recorded in the city of Wuhan. The US has had more than 34,500 fatalities, Italy more than 22,000 and Spain has seen more than 19,500. The US has more confirmed cases than any other country \u2013 over 676,000. Many of those who have died had underlying health conditions, which the coronavirus complicated.\n\nMore than 543,500 people are recorded as having recovered from coronavirus.\n\nPlay Video 4:16 What happens if you are in hospital with coronavirus - video explainer\n\nWhy is this worse than normal influenza, and how worried are the experts?\n\nWe don\u2019t yet know how dangerous the new coronavirus is, and we won\u2019t know until more data comes in, but estimates of the mortality rate have ranged from well below 1% in the young to over 3% among those who are elderly or have underlying health conditions. Seasonal flu typically has a mortality rate below 1% and is thought to cause about 400,000 deaths each year globally. Sars had a death rate of more than 10%.\n\nAnother key unknown is how contagious the coronavirus is. A crucial difference is that unlike flu, there is no vaccine for the new coronavirus, which means it is more difficult for vulnerable members of the population \u2013 elderly people or those with existing respiratory or immune problems \u2013 to protect themselves. Hand-washing and avoiding other people if you feel unwell are important.\n\nHave there been other coronaviruses?\n\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (Mers) are both caused by coronaviruses that came from animals. In 2002, Sars spread virtually unchecked to 37 countries, causing global panic, infecting more than 8,000 people and killing more than 750. Mers appears to be less easily passed from human to human, but has greater lethality, killing 35% of about 2,500 people who have been infected.", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/17/what-is-coronavirus-what-are-its-symptoms-and-when-should-i-call-a-doctor", "published": "2020-04-17T00:00:00", "author": ["Sarah Boseley", "Hannah Devlin", "Martin Belam"]}, {"title": "Can a face mask protect me from coronavirus? Covid-19 myths busted", "text": "The truth about how you can catch coronavirus, who is most vulnerable and what you can do to avoid infection\n\nClaim: \u2018Face masks don\u2019t work\u2019\n\nWearing a face mask is certainly not an iron-clad guarantee that you won\u2019t get sick \u2013 viruses can also transmit through the eyes and tiny viral particles, known as aerosols, can penetrate masks. However, masks are effective at capturing droplets, which is a main transmission route of coronavirus, and some studies have estimated a roughly fivefold protection versus no barrier alone (although others have found lower levels of effectiveness).\n\nIf you are likely to be in close contact with someone infected, a mask cuts the chance of the disease being passed on. If you\u2019re showing symptoms of coronavirus, or have been diagnosed, wearing a mask can also protect others. So masks are crucial for health and social care workers looking after patients and are also recommended for family members who need to care for someone who is ill \u2013 ideally both the patient and carer should have a mask.\n\nHowever, masks will probably make little difference if you\u2019re just walking around town or taking a bus so there is no need to bulk-buy a huge supply.\n\nClaim: \u2018It is mutating into a more deadly strain\u2019\n\nAll viruses accumulate mutations over time and the virus that causes Covid-19 is no different. How widespread different strains of a virus become depends on natural selection \u2013 the versions that can propagate quickest and replicate effectively in the body will be the most \u201csuccessful\u201d. This doesn\u2019t necessarily mean most dangerous for people though, as viruses that kill people rapidly or make them so sick that they are incapacitated may be less likely to be transmitted.\n\nGenetic analysis by Chinese scientists of 103 samples of the virus, taken from patients in Wuhan and other cities, suggests that early on two main strains emerged, designated L and S. Although the L strain appeared to be more prevalent than the S strain (about 70% of the samples belonged to the former), the S branch of the virus was found to be the ancestral version.\n\nThe team behind this research suggested that this may indicate the L strain is more \u201caggressive\u201d, either transmitting more easily or replicating faster inside the body. However, this theory is speculative at this stage \u2013 there haven\u2019t yet been direct comparisons to see whether people who catch one version of the virus are more likely to pass it on or suffer more severe symptoms.\n\nClaim: \u2018It is no more dangerous than winter flu\u2019\n\nMany individuals who get coronavirus will experience nothing worse than seasonal flu symptoms, but the overall profile of the disease, including its mortality rate, looks more serious. At the start of an outbreak the apparent mortality rate can be an overestimate if a lot of mild cases are being missed. But Bruce Aylward, a WHO expert, who led an international mission to China to learn about the virus and the country\u2019s response, said this has not been the case with Covid-19. The evidence did not suggest that we were only seeing the tip of the iceberg. If borne out by further testing, this could mean that current estimates of a roughly 1% fatality rate are accurate. This would make Covid-19 about 10 times more deadly than seasonal flu, which is estimated to kill between 290,000 and 650,000 people a year globally.\n\nClaim: \u2018It only kills the elderly, so younger people can relax\u2019\n\nMost people who are not elderly and do not have underlying health conditions will not become critically ill from Covid-19. But the illness still has a higher chance of leading to serious respiratory symptoms than seasonal flu and there are other at-risk groups \u2013 health workers, for instance, are more vulnerable because they are likely to have higher exposure to the virus. The actions that young, healthy people take, including reporting symptoms and following quarantine instructions, will have an important role in protecting the most vulnerable in society and in shaping the overall trajectory of the outbreak.\n\nClaim: \u2018You need to be with an infected person for 10 minutes\u2019\n\nFor flu, some hospital guidelines define exposure as being within six feet of an infected person who sneezes or coughs for 10 minutes or longer. However, it is possible to be infected with shorter interactions or even by picking the virus up from contaminated surfaces, although this is thought to be a less common route of transmission.\n\nClaim: \u2018A vaccine could be ready within a few months\u2019\n\nScientists were quick out of the gates in beginning development of a vaccine for the new coronavirus, helped by the early release of the genetic sequence by Chinese researchers. The development of a viable vaccine continues apace, with several teams now testing candidates in animal experiments. However, the incremental trials required before a commercial vaccine could be rolled out are still a lengthy undertaking \u2013 and an essential one to ensure that even rare side-effects are spotted. A commercially available vaccine within a year would be quick.\u2019", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/11/can-a-face-mask-protect-me-from-coronavirus-covid-19-myths-busted", "published": "2020-04-11T00:00:00", "author": ["Hannah Devlin"]}, {"title": "When will a coronavirus vaccine be ready?", "text": "Human trials have begun \u2013 but even if they go well and a cure is found, there are many barriers before global immunisation is feasible\n\nTHOUGH we can slow the spread of Covid-19, through confinement and other social distancing measures, and scientists are developing drugs to treat its symptoms, the only way to actually prevent people from catching Covid-19 is with a vaccine \u2013 and we don\u2019t yet have one of those.\n\nNearly 80 companies and academic institutions are racing to produce one, and of those, five are already testing their vaccine candidates in people. The first of these to enter human trials \u2013 one produced by Boston-based biotech company Moderna \u2013 did so on 16 March.\n\nThis unprecedented speed is thanks in large part to early Chinese efforts to sequence the genetic material of Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. China shared that sequence in early January, allowing research groups around the world to grow the live virus and study how it invades human cells and makes people sick.\n\nCoronavirus vaccine: when will we have one? Read more\n\nBut there is another reason for the head start. Though nobody could have predicted that the next infectious disease to threaten the globe would be caused by a coronavirus \u2013 flu is generally considered to pose the greatest pandemic risk \u2013 vaccinologists had hedged their bets by working on \u201cprototype\u201d pathogens. \u201cThe speed with which we have [produced these candidates] builds very much on the investment in understanding how to develop vaccines for other coronaviruses,\u201d says Richard Hatchett, CEO of the Oslo-based nonprofit the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (Cepi), which is leading efforts to finance and coordinate Covid-19 vaccine development.\n\nHere's how your body gains immunity to coronavirus | Zania Stamataki Read more\n\nCoronaviruses have caused two other recent epidemics \u2013 severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) in China in 2002-04, and Middle East respiratory syndrome (Mers), which started in Saudi Arabia in 2012. In both cases, work began on vaccines that were later shelved when the outbreaks were contained. One company, Maryland-based Novavax, has now repurposed those vaccines for Sars-CoV-2, and says it has several candidates ready to enter human trials this spring. Moderna, meanwhile, built on earlier work on the Mers virus conducted at the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in Bethesda, Maryland.\n\nSARS-CoV-2 shares between 80% and 90% of its genetic material with the virus that caused SARS \u2013 hence its name. Both consist of a strip of RNA enclosed in a fatty shell through which protrude many protein spikes. The spikes lock on to receptors on the surface of cells lining the human lung \u2013 the same type of receptor in both cases \u2013 allowing the virus to break into the cell. Once inside, it hijacks the cell\u2019s reproductive machinery to produce more copies of itself, before breaking out of the cell again and killing it in the process.\n\nAll vaccines work according to the same basic principle. They present part or all of the pathogen to the human immune system, usually in the form of an injection and at a low dose, to prompt the system to produce antibodies to the pathogen. Antibodies are a kind of immune memory which, having been elicited once, can be quickly mobilised again if the person is exposed to the virus in its natural form.\n\nLike most vaccinologists, I don\u2019t think this vaccine will be ready before 18 months Professor Annelies Wilder-Smith\n\nTraditionally, immunisation has been achieved using live, weakened forms of the virus, or part or whole of the virus once it has been inactivated by heat or chemicals. These methods have drawbacks. The live form can continue to evolve in the host, for example, potentially recapturing some of its virulence and making the recipient sick, while higher or repeat doses of the inactivated virus are required to achieve the necessary degree of protection. Some of the Covid-19 vaccine projects are using these tried-and-tested approaches, but others are using newer technology. One more recent strategy \u2013 the one that Novavax is taking, for example \u2013 constructs a \u201crecombinant\u201d vaccine. This involves extracting the genetic code for the protein spike on the surface of SARS-CoV-2, which is the part of the virus most likely to provoke an immune reaction in humans, and pasting it into the genome of a bacterium or yeast \u2013 forcing these micro-organisms to churn out large quantities of the protein. Other approaches, that are even newer, bypass the protein and build vaccines from the genetic instruction itself. This is the case for Moderna and a German company, CureVac, both of which are building Covid-19 vaccines out of messenger RNA.\n\nCepi\u2019s original portfolio of four funded Covid-19 vaccine projects was heavily skewed towards these more innovative technologies, but it has since added four others that take more tried-and-tested approaches \u2013 including a project at the University of Oxford that uses a harmless, non-replicating virus to carry SARS-CoV-2 genetic material into the body\u2019s cells \u2013 and it will continue to add to that portfolio. \u201cOur experience with vaccine development is that you can\u2019t anticipate where you\u2019re going to stumble,\u201d says Hatchett, meaning that diversity is key. And the stage where any approach is most likely to stumble is clinical or human trials.\n\nClinical trials, an essential precursor to regulatory approval, usually take place in three phases. The first, involving a few dozen healthy volunteers, tests the vaccine for safety, monitoring for adverse effects. The second, involving several hundred people, usually in a part of the world affected by the disease, looks at how effective the vaccine is, and the third does the same in several thousand people. But there\u2019s a high level of attrition as experimental vaccines pass through these phases. \u201cNot all horses that leave the starting gate will finish the race,\u201d says Bruce Gellin, who runs the global immunisation programme for the Washington DC-based non-profit, the Sabin Vaccine Institute.\n\nThere are good reasons for that. Either the candidates are unsafe, or they\u2019re ineffective, or both. Screening out duds is essential, which is why clinical trials can\u2019t be skipped or hurried. Approval can be accelerated if regulators have approved similar products before. The annual flu vaccine, for example, is the product of a well-honed assembly line in which only one or a few modules have to be updated each year. In contrast, Sars-CoV-2 is a novel pathogen in humans, and many of the technologies being used to build vaccines are relatively untested too. No vaccine made from genetic material \u2013 RNA or DNA \u2013 has been approved to date, for example. So many of the Covid-19 vaccine candidates have to be treated as brand new vaccines, and as Gellin says: \u201cWhile there is a push to do things as fast as possible, it\u2019s really important not to take shortcuts.\u201d\n\nAn illustration of that is a vaccine that was produced in the 1960s against respiratory syncytial virus, a common virus that causes cold-like symptoms in children. In clinical trials, this vaccine was found to aggravate those symptoms in infants who went on to catch the virus. A similar effect was observed in animals given an early experimental Sars vaccine. It was later modified to eliminate that problem but, now that it has been repurposed for Sars-CoV-2, it will need to be put through especially stringent safety testing to rule out the risk of enhanced disease.\n\nIt\u2019s for these reasons that taking a vaccine candidate all the way to regulatory approval typically takes a decade or more, and why President Trump sowed confusion when, at a meeting at the White House on 2 March, he pressed for a vaccine to be ready by the US elections in November \u2013 an impossible deadline. \u201cLike most vaccinologists, I don\u2019t think this vaccine will be ready before 18 months,\u201d says Annelies Wilder-Smith, professor of emerging infectious diseases at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. That\u2019s already extremely fast, and it assumes there will be no hitches.\n\nIn the meantime, there is another potential problem. As soon as a vaccine is approved, it\u2019s going to be needed in vast quantities \u2013 and many of the organisations in the Covid-19 vaccine race simply don\u2019t have the necessary production capacity. Vaccine development is already a risky affair, in business terms, because so few candidates get anywhere near the clinic. Production facilities tend to be tailored to specific vaccines, and scaling these up when you don\u2019t yet know if your product will succeed is not commercially feasible. Cepi and similar organisations exist to shoulder some of the risk, keeping companies incentivised to develop much-needed vaccines. Cepi plans to invest in developing a Covid-19 vaccine and boosting manufacturing capacity in parallel, and last month it put out a call for $2bn to allow it to do so.\n\nPlay Video 5:59 Can you get coronavirus twice? \u2013 video explainer\n\nOnce a Covid-19 vaccine has been approved, a further set of challenges will present itself. \u201cGetting a vaccine that\u2019s proven to be safe and effective in humans takes one at best about a third of the way to what\u2019s needed for a global immunisation programme,\u201d says global health expert Jonathan Quick of Duke University in North Carolina, author of The End of Epidemics (2018). \u201cVirus biology and vaccines technology could be the limiting factors, but politics and economics are far more likely to be the barrier to immunisation.\u201d\n\nThe problem is making sure the vaccine gets to all those who need it. This is a challenge even within countries, and some have worked out guidelines. In the scenario of a flu pandemic, for example, the UK would prioritise vaccinating healthcare and social care workers, along with those considered at highest medical risk \u2013 including children and pregnant women \u2013 with the overall goal of keeping sickness and death ra tes as low as possible. But in a pandemic, countries also have to compete with each other for medicines.\n\nLockdowns can't end until Covid-19 vaccine found, study says Read more\n\nBecause pandemics tend to hit hardest those countries that have the most fragile and underfunded healthcare systems, there is an inherent imbalance between need and purchasing power when it comes to vaccines. During the 2009 H1N1 flu pandemic, for example, vaccine supplies were snapped up by nations that could afford them, leaving poorer ones short. But you could also imagine a scenario where, say, India \u2013 a major supplier of vaccines to the developing world \u2013 not unreasonably decides to use its vaccine production to protect its own 1.3 billion-strong population first, before exporting any.\n\nOutside of pandemics, the WHO brings governments, charitable foundations and vaccine-makers together to agree an equitable global distribution strategy, and organisations like Gavi, the vaccine alliance, have come up with innovative funding mechanisms to raise money on the markets for ensuring supply to poorer countries. But each pandemic is different, and no country is bound by any arrangement the WHO proposes \u2013 leaving many unknowns. As Seth Berkley, CEO of Gavi, points out: \u201cThe question is, what will happen in a situation where you\u2019ve got national emergencies going on?\u201d\n\nThis question is being debated, but it will be a while before we see how it plays out. \u201c[This pandemic] will probably have peaked and declined before a vaccine is available,\u201d says Wilder-Smith. A vaccine could still save many lives, especially if the virus becomes endemic or perennially circulating \u2013 like flu \u2013 and there are further, possibly seasonal, outbreaks. But until then, our best hope is to slow the spread of the disease as far as possible.

There have been numerous reports since early in the pandemic of Asian Americans being blamed for \u201cbringing the virus\u201d into the country and being told \u201cgo back to China\u201d.\n\nThe attacks have erupted in college campuses, city subways and online. The FBI has warned local law enforcement across the country that Asian American communities are at risk due to rising hostility during the coronavirus crisis.\n\nAmong the more serious attacks that have been chronicled was a stabbing of a Burmese man and his two young children in Midland, Texas, in March. The teenaged assailant told police he had targeted the family because he thought they were Chinese and were spreading coronavirus.\n\nThe authors of the joint statement say that \u201cthe time to turn back this wave of hate is now.

In getting there, it will have used up all its reserves, taken \u00a34m from the government\u2019s furlough scheme, and spent its \u00a319.2m annual grant from Arts Council England \u201cto effectively mothball the buildings\u201d.\n\nThe centre said: \u201cThere will be hardly any artistic activity throughout 2020/21, as to present anything like a normal range of events would have seen the losses rise to around \u00a311m.\u201d The venue would be able to host events with only a limited number of guests because of the restrictions necessitated by physical distancing.\n\nThe centre is the latest arts organisation to warn of the existential threat to Britain\u2019s world-leading cultural sector, with theatre described as being \u201con the brink of total collapse.\u201d The government last week announced a taskforce led by philanthropist Neil Mendoza to advise on how the sector can set out on the road to recovery.\n\nThe Southbank Centre gets about 37% of its income from subsidy.

People think it\u2019s like flicking a light switch back on again but it absolutely isn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fiendishly complicated and will take a lot longer than people think because there are a number of different problems that have to be sorted first. We need to ensure that hospitals are safe for people without coronavirus who need to be treated, including those who need elective surgery.\u201d\n\nSome 4.2 million people in England are waiting to have a non-urgent procedure such as a cataract removal, hernia repair or hip or knee replacement.\n\nHopson\u2019s remarks are a blow to Hancock and Sir Simon Stevens, NHS England\u2019s chief executive. They have told hospitals to resume as soon as possible the normal activities \u2013 operations and diagnostic tests \u2013 that have been largely suspended since March because of the pandemic.\n\nHospitals cannot do that until doctors and nurses can have regular tests for coronavirus and get the results back very quickly, to prevent asymptomatic staff \u2013 or patients arriving for an operation \u2013 inadvertently bringing the virus in with them, added Hopson.\n\nIn pointed criticism of ministers, he said: \u201cThe gap between the tone and content of the government\u2019s statements on testing and the difficult reality on the ground is painfully wide and needs to be closed quickly. The reality is five- and even 13-day test turnaround times, which are effectively useless to the hospital.\u201d\n\nHancock pledged on 10 April that \u201cwe have capacity for all key social care staff and NHS staff who need to be tested to get those tests\u201d. But many health workers say it is still too difficult to get a test and that results can take many days to come back.\n\nShortages of full-length surgical gowns could mean that patients have their surgery cancelled at the last minute, Hopson added.\n\nAlthough patients due to have surgery have been told to isolate for 14 days beforehand, trusts typically only have four or five days of supply in hand, so cannot guarantee that they will have enough PPE to undertake the surgery, added Hopson.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s particularly unfair to ask a patient whose operation has already been delayed to start the difficult process of isolation without being certain that they can actually perform the surgery when the due date arrives.\u201d\n\nNHS England bosses are understood to be sympathetic to Hopson\u2019s concerns and share what he called hospital bosses\u2019 \u201cdeep frustration\u201d at ministers\u2019 failure to solve either problem.\n\nHopson also identified \u201cabsolute exhaustion\u201d among staff and the need to retain around 25% of intensive care unit beds for people with Covid-19 as other constraints on the NHS\u2019s ability to return to normal.\n\nPublic Health England research published on Tuesday found that up to a fifth of hospital inpatients with Coronavirus and nine out of 10 healthcare staff may have become infected in hospital.\n\nDoctors\u2019 leaders said Hopson was right to warn that safety had to have been assured before operations could restart.\n\n\u201cWhile the PPE situation is improving, we need a guarantee that there is adequate equipment to protect all staff before we recommence services. This includes equipment for those delivering non-Covid care in order to reduce the risk of transmission through health settings.

And how to hold those governments responsible for their mistakes, without playing political games during a health crisis?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very hard balance to strike, but there have been moments where we had no choice except to fight back,\u201d admitted the mayor of Budapest, Gergely Kar\u00e1csony, in a recent interview at his office.\n\nIn Hungary, where the overall number of coronavirus infections has remained low, the government of the far-right prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, has sought to portray the opposition as \u201cpro-virus\u201d, and has put the blame on Kar\u00e1csony for deaths in the capital\u2019s care homes.\n\n\u201cIt was part of the government strategy for the pandemic to create and provoke direct confrontation with the opposition,\u201d he said.\n\nThe mayor was elected last October after standing against Orb\u00e1n\u2019s favoured candidate, and is seen as a potential challenger to the prime minister in nationwide elections two years from now. Perhaps with an eye on that vote, Orb\u00e1n has not sought consensus in the coronavirus response. He refused to put a time limit on special coronavirus legislation that he pushed through parliament in late March, even though the opposition said it would support it if a sunset clause was introduced.\n\nIn some countries, politicians suspended their traditional bickering at the peak of the crisis, and support for radical political alternatives dried up. In Britain, the Labour leader, Sir Keir Starmer, initially offered words of support and cooperation but then carefully picked certain battles to highlight problematic government responses.\n\nIn Italy, the popularity of the prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, soared during the crisis, with a small decline in support for the far-right Matteo Salvini. In Germany, where there is more of a tradition of consensus-based politics, most of the opposition has refrained from criticising the government up to now. In Germany, both the government and chancellor, Angela Merkel, are enjoying high popularity ratings, with 68% of Germans satisfied with Merkel, the highest of her time in office.\n\nThe far-right populist AfD has struggled to be noticed since the coronavirus crisis began and has seen its popularity ratings fall considerably, while the rest of the opposition has been keen not to be seen to be rocking the boat at a difficult time, meaning it has struggled to make its presence felt.\n\n\u201cThe style of cooperative opposition is more popular in Germany than that of fundamental opposition. Germans are not only believers in the state but they love decisions made at a round table,\u201d said the political scientist Karl-Rudolf Korte in a recent interview with the S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung.\n\nHowever, when the economic consequences of coronavirus really begin to hit, the \u201crally round the flag\u201d effect will slowly dissolve, and opposition parties could have a chance to strike.\n\nAlready, there are signs that Conte\u2019s popularity levels are dropping, and with the end of lockdown in Germany, the opposition parties have declared a return to politics as usual as well. \u201cUnanimity over the question of crisis management is over,\u201d Christian Lindner, leader of the pro-business FDP, said recently.\n\nElsewhere, there was never a period of unanimity in the first place, and political battles have only intensified. In Poland, the government sought to plough ahead with a presidential election on 10 May, in conditions where it would be almost impossible for the opposition to run a proper campaign, at a time when energy was devoted to fighting the virus. At the last minute the vote was cancelled, with a new vote tentatively planned for next month.\n\n\u201cThe pandemic crisis certainly helped the Polish government to tilt the playing field so opposition candidates do not have equal opportunities during the campaign,\u201d said Edit Zgut, a visiting lecturer at the University of Warsaw. \u201cWhenever the election is scheduled, it will be far from fair.\u201d\n\nIn Hungary, as recriminations between the government and the mayor of Budapest over the handling of the pandemic have increased, the discourse has got personal in rather strange ways. In a recent interview, Orb\u00e1n said Kar\u00e1csony was the sort of person who couldn\u2019t put Ikea furniture together without help. \u201cOr to put what I\u2019m talking about into a rural context, when there\u2019s a traditional pig slaughter this is someone who only turns up right at the end for dinner,\u201d said Orb\u00e1n.\n\nKar\u00e1csony said the personal attacks prove the government is rattled by the opposition, and part of a strategy to shift the blame.\n\n\u201cThe social and economic fallout will be very severe, and they want to tackle that by starting this blame game and making the opposition look like they didn\u2019t want consensus,\u201d he said.", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/25/opposition-leaders-across-europe-walk-coronavirus-tightrope", "published": "2020-05-25T00:00:00", "author": ["Shaun Walker", "Kate Connolly"]}, {"title": "Sweden 'wrong' not to shut down, says former state epidemiologist", "text": "The predecessor of Sweden\u2019s state epidemiologist has broken her silence on the country\u2019s controversial coronavirus strategy, saying she now believes the authorities should have put in place tougher restrictions in the early stages of the pandemic to bring the virus under control.\n\n\n\nAnnika Linde, who oversaw Sweden\u2019s response to swine flu and Sars as state epidemiologist from 2005 to 2013, had until now expressed support for her country\u2019s approach under her successor, Anders Tegnell.\n\n\n\nBut she has now become the first member of the public health establishment to break ranks, saying she has changed her mind as a result of Sweden\u2019s relatively high death toll compared with that of its neighbours, Denmark, Norway, and Finland.\n\n\u201cI think that we needed more time for preparedness. If we had shut down very early ... we would have been able, during that time, to make sure that we had what was necessary to protect the vulnerable,\u201d Linde told the Observer.\n\nFor two days last week Sweden had the highest per capita death rate in the world on a seven-day rolling average, and the overall death toll is expected to pass 4,000 this weekend.\n\nPer capita death rates in Denmark, Finland and Norway, which all put in place far-reaching lockdowns, are now, respectively, four, seven and nine times lower than that of Sweden.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest While other countries were in lockdown, Sweden relied on a \u2018common sense\u2019 approach. Here, people sit in the sun at the western harbour in Malmo on 5 April. Photograph: Johan Nilsson/TT News Agency\n\nSweden has run the least restrictive strategy of any developed country, leaving lower secondary schools, bars, restaurants, shopping malls and gyms open, and allowing gatherings of up to 50 people. It has placed heavy reliance on the social responsibility and common sense of the public.\n\nLinde said that she had initially shared the thinking underpinning Sweden\u2019s approach. \u201cThe basic perception was, I think, that sooner or later, irrespective of what you do, you will have the whole population infected,\u201d she said.\n\n\n\n\u201cSo when Anders Tegnell said \u2018we will flatten the curve, and we will protect the vulnerable\u2019, I thought \u2018we will reach herd immunity after a while. It could be a good strategy\u2019. I wasn\u2019t that critical.\u201d\n\n\n\nSince then many countries have demonstrated that it is possible to dramatically lower the incidence of coronavirus infection and bring the pandemic, at least temporarily, under control.\n\n\n\nAt the same time, the second part of Sweden\u2019s strategy \u2013 to protect the elderly and other risk groups \u2013 has failed.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis was like a dream that we could protect the elderly, with very little basis in reality,\u201d argued Linde, who as a 72-year-old has now spent more than two months in semi-isolation.\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Sweden\u2019s state epidemiologist Anders Tegnell now admits the country is in a \u2018terrible situation\u2019. Photograph: Jonas Ekstromer/TT News Agency\n\nPoliticians, the media and the public in Sweden continue largely to support the public health agency\u2019s handling the pandemic, with the exception of a small group of academics and researchers. Linde\u2019s criticisms, first aired in an interview in the Dagens Nyheter newspaper, mark the first critical intervention from a member of the public health establishment.\n\n\n\nTegnell, in an interview to be broadcast today on Swedish national radio, conceded that the country was in a \u201cterrible situation\u201d but dismissed the idea that a lockdown would have helped.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt very common to come up with that criticism, and say \u2018if we had locked down, we could have done so much more before. But when I ask the question, \u2018what, exactly, could we have done which would have changed so much?\u2019, then I don\u2019t get so many answers.\u201d\n\nLinde said Tegnell was wrong to place the blame for the high rate of infection in Swedish elderly care homes on the local authorities and the private companies who run them.\n\n\n\nThis \u201csounds logical\u201d, she said. \u201cBut it should be informed upwards that the preparedness is there, so that those that decide on the strategy know that the strategy is possible to realise. This was missing.\u201d\n\n\n\nShe attributed the failure of Sweden\u2019s approach partly to the public health agency\u2019s unwillingness to adapt a pre-prepared strategy built on the experience of influenza pandemics, such as Spanish flu and swine flu, to coronavirus.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe fact that it was compared too much to influenza epidemics could have made us make the wrong assumptions in the beginning,\u201d she said. \u201cWe could have maybe had another development had we been, for example, more aware of the risk of spread from asymptomatic individuals.\u201d\n\n\n\n", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/24/sweden-wrong-not-to-shut-down-says-former-state-epidemiologist", "published": "2020-05-24T00:00:00", "author": ["Richard Orange"]}, {"title": "Covid-19 and 100 days that transformed the world: the 17 April edition of the Guardian Weekly", "text": "This week our international news magazine considers how we even begin to process a period of such rapid and phenomenal global change.

For some countries, the worst may be beginning to pass; for others, things may be about to darken further. The uncertainty is almost as discomfiting as our fears of the illness. Since the Weekly carried its first small report on the novel coronavirus on 10 January (\u201cRespiratory contagion is not Sars, authorities say\u201d) the world has changed in ways that few could have imagined possible.\n\nLast week the Guardian ran a fascinating series of articles on the 100 days in which Covid-19 went from a small flicker in the world\u2019s consciousness to the defining crisis of a generation. We\u2019re pleased to feature a selection of them in this week\u2019s edition of the Weekly. We begin with Jonathan Freedland\u2019s analysis of how the disaster has unfolded in the UK and around the world \u2013 a change so fast we can barely grasp its scale. Our global environment editor Jonathan Watts considers the low-carbon, wildlife-friendly state we find ourselves in \u2013 and asks if we can find a way to make it last. Then, Guardian economics editor Larry Elliott looks at the speed in which the global economy was ravaged by the virus, and diplomatic editor Patrick Wintour considers the geopolitical winners and losers from the crisis.\n\nOur Covid-19 analysis continues with a look at why the virus has been so effective at targeting the poor in the United States \u2013 now the world\u2019s worst-hit country.\n\nThen, in the UK, we look back at Boris Johnson\u2019s week in hospital. Will his brush with mortality influence his famously cavalier outlook? We also report on the very un-Britishly efficient building of field hospitals and mortuaries in preparation for the worst weeks of the virus. We\u2019re also looking at the latest science, lessons on immunology and much more throughout the magazine, including a brilliant read by the food writer Bee Wilson about the psychology behind stockpiling food in a crisis.\n\nAs you\u2019d expect, Covid-19 is affecting almost everything that\u2019s happening on the planet at the moment. However, we\u2019re keen to make sure there\u2019s more than just the virus in the magazine. This week we have a beautiful feature from the Guardian\u2019s US team by Chris Sweeney about a golden eagle and the mystery surrounding its death. In our culture pages, rock critic Alexis Petridis meets the Strokes ahead of their sixth album and finds a band who have finally come out of their shell (a bit).\n\nAndrew Male meets the woman who makes eerily affecting collages from plastic detritus washed in from the sea \u2013 and, in books, we round up the best new (and old) books for kids stuck indoors.

It may seem premature, in the midst of what Emmanuel Macron has described as \u201ca war against an invisible enemy\u201d, to consider the political and economic consequences of a distant peace. Few attempt a definitive review of a play after the first three scenes.\n\nYet world leaders, diplomats and geopolitical analysts know they are living through epoch-making times and have one eye on the daily combat, the other on what this crisis will bequeath the world. Competing ideologies, power blocs, leaders and systems of social cohesion are being stress-tested in the court of world opinion.\n\nAlready everyone in the global village is starting to draw lessons. In France, Macron has predicted \u201cthis period will have taught us a lot. Many certainties and convictions will be swept away. Many things that we thought were impossible are happening. The day after when we have won, it will not be a return to the day before, we will be stronger morally. We will draw the consequences, all the consequences.\u201d He has promised to start with major health investment. A Macronist group of MPs has already started a Jour d\u2019Apr\u00e8s website.\n\nCoronavirus world map: which countries have the most cases and deaths? Read more\n\nIn Germany, the former Social Democratic party foreign minister Sigmar Gabriel has lamented that \u201cwe talked the state down for 30 years\u201d, and predicts the next generation will be less naive about globalisation. In Italy, the former prime minister Matteo Renzi has called for a commission into the future. In Hong Kong, graffiti reads: \u201cThere can be no return to normal because normal was the problem in the first place.\u201d Henry Kissinger, the US secretary of state under Richard Nixon, says rulers must prepare now to transition to a post-coronavirus world order.\n\nThe UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, has said: \u201cThe relationship between the biggest powers has never been as dysfunctional. Covid-19 is showing dramatically, either we join [together] ... or we can be defeated.\u201d\n\nThe discussion in global thinktanks rages, not about cooperation, but whether the Chinese or the US will emerge as leaders of the post-coronavirus world.\n\nIn the UK, the debate has been relatively insular. The outgoing Labour leadership briefly searched for vindication in the evident rehabilitation of the state and its workforce. The definition of public service has been extended to include the delivery driver and the humble corner shop owner. Indeed, to be \u201ca nation of shopkeepers\u201d, the great Napoleonic insult, no longer looks so bad.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The delivery driver has become an icon of public service in Britain during the coronavirus outbreak. Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The Guardian\n\nThe obvious and widely drawn parallel has been, as so often in Britain, the second world war. In The Road to 1945, Paul Addison\u2019s definitive account of how the second world war helped turn Britain to the left, he quotes the diary of the journalist JL Hodson in September 1944: \u201cNo excuses any more for unemployment and slums and underfeeding. We have shown in this war we British don\u2019t muddle through. Using even half the vision and energy and invention and pulling together we\u2019ve done in this war and what is there we cannot do? We\u2019ve virtually exploded the argument of old fogies and Better Notters who said we cannot afford this and mustn\u2019t do that. Our heavy taxation and rationing of food has willy nilly achieved some levelling up of the nation.\u201d\n\nIn the same vein, Boris Johnson has been forced to unleash the state, but the impact in Britain seems more noticeable on civil society than politics. The famously standoffish British are no longer bowling alone. The sense of communal effort, the volunteer health workers, the unBritish clapping on doorsteps, all add to the sense that lost social capital is being reformed. But there is not yet much discussion of a new politics. Perhaps the nation, exhausted by Brexit, cannot cope with more introspection and upheaval.\n\nIn Europe, the US and Asia the discussion has broadened out. Public life may be at a standstill, but public debate has accelerated. Everything is up for debate \u2013 the trade-offs between a trashed economy and public health, the relative virtues of centralised or regionalised health systems, the exposed fragilities of globalisation, the future of the EU, populism, the inherent advantage of authoritarianism.\n\nIt is as if the pandemic has turned into a competition for global leadership, and it will be the countries that most effectively respond to the crisis that will gain traction. Diplomats, operating out of emptied embassies, are busy defending their governments\u2019 handling of the crisis, and often take deep offence to criticism. National pride, and health, are at stake. Each country looks at their neighbour to see how quickly they are \u201cflattening the curve\u201d.\n\nThe Crisis Group thinktank, in assessing how the virus will permanently change international politics, suggests: \u201cFor now we can discern two competing narratives gaining currency \u2013 one in which the lesson is that countries ought to come together to better defeat Covid-19, and one in which the lesson is that countries need to stand apart in order to better protect themselves from it.\n\n\u201cThe crisis also represents a stark test of the competing claims of liberal and illiberal states to better manage extreme social distress. As the pandemic unfolds it will test not only the operational capacities of organisations like the WHO and the UN but also the basic assumptions about the values and political bargains that underpin them.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A Russian plane delivers medical equipment to Spain. Photograph: Jos\u00e9 Jordan/AFP via Getty Images\n\nMany are already claiming that the east has won this war of competing narratives. The South Korean philosopher Byung-Chul Han, in an influential essay in El Pa\u00eds, has argued the victors are the \u201cAsian states like Japan, Korea, China, Hong Kong, Taiwan or Singapore that have an authoritarian mentality which comes from their cultural tradition [of] Confucianism. People are less rebellious and more obedient than in Europe. They trust the state more. Daily life is much more organised. Above all, to confront the virus Asians are strongly committed to digital surveillance. The epidemics in Asia are fought not only by virologists and epidemiologists, but also computer scientists and big data specialists.\u201d\n\nHe predicts: \u201cChina will now be able to sell its digital police state as a model of success against the pandemic. China will display the superiority of its system even more proudly.\u201d He claims western voters, attracted to safety and community, might be willing to sacrifice those liberties. There is little liberty in being forced to spend spring shut in your own flat.\n\nIndeed, China is already on a victory lap of sorts, believing it has deftly repositioned itself from the culprit to the world\u2019s saviour. A new generation of young assertive Chinese diplomats have taken to social media to assert their country\u2019s superiority. Michel Duclos, the former French ambassador now at the Institut Montaigne, has accused China of \u201cshamelessly trying to capitalise on the country\u2019s \u2018victory against the virus\u2019 to promote its political system. The kind of undeclared cold war that had been brewing for some time shows its true face under the harsh light of Covid-19.\u201d\n\nPlay Video 8:07 How coronavirus changed the world in three months \u2013 video\n\nThe Harvard international relations theorist Stephen Walt thinks China may succeed. Offering a first take to Foreign Policy magazine, he suggests: \u201cCoronavirus will accelerate the shift of power and influence from west to east. South Korea and Singapore have shown the best response and China has managed well in the aftermath of its initial mistakes. The governments\u2019 response in Europe and the US has been very sceptical and likely to weaken the power of the western brand.\u201d\n\nMany on the European left, such as the Slovenian philosopher Slavoj \u017di\u017eek, also fear an authoritarian contagion, predicting in the west \u201ca new barbarism with a human face \u2013 ruthless survivalist measures enforced with regret and even sympathy, but legitimised by expert opinions\u201d.\n\nBy contrast, Shivshankar Menon, a visiting professor at Ashoka University in India, says: \u201cExperience so far shows that authoritarians or populists are no better at handling the pandemic. Indeed, the countries that responded early and successfully, such as Korea and Taiwan, have been democracies \u2013 not those run by populist or authoritarian leaders.\u201d\n\nFrancis Fukuyama concurs: \u201cThe major dividing line in effective crisis response will not place autocracies on one side and democracies on the other. The crucial determinant in performance will not be the type of regime, but the state\u2019s capacity and, above all, trust in government.\u201d He has praised Germany and South Korea.\n\nSouth Korea is in fact selling itself as the democratic power, in contrast to China, that has best handled the crisis. Its national press is full of articles on how Germany is following the South Korean model of mass testing.\n\nBut South Korea, an export-oriented economy, also faces long-term difficulties if the pandemic forces the west, as Prof Joseph Stiglitz predicts, into a total reassessment of the global supply chain. He argues the pandemic has revealed the drawbacks of concentrating production of medical supplies. As a result, just-in-time imports will go down and production of domestically sourced goods will go up. South Korea may gain kudos, but lose markets.\n\nThe loser at the moment, apart from those like Steve Bannon who argued for \u201cthe deconstruction of the administrative state\u201d, risks being the EU.\n\nSome of Europe\u2019s most scathing critics have been the pro-Europeans. Nicole Gnesotto, the vice-president of the Jacques Delors Institute thinktank, says: \u201cThe EU\u2019s lack of preparations, its powerlessness, its timidity are staggering. Of course, health is not part of its competency, but it is not without means or responsibility.\u201d The first instinct was to close borders, hoard equipment and assemble national responses. In times of scarcity it emerged every person was for themself, and Italy felt most left to itself.\n\nBut the dispute has widened into an ugly battle between north and south Europe over the isssuance of common debt, or the conditions that could be set for any credit issued by the eurozone bailout fund. The Dutch and Germans suspect Italy is using the crisis in Lombardy to rebrand the rejected concept of eurobonds in which the north finances the debts of the feckless south. The Italian prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, is pushing the issue, telling the bloc \u201cit has an appointment with history\u201d. If the EU fails, it could fall apart, he has warned.\n\nThe Portuguese prime minister, Ant\u00f3nio Costa, spoke of \u201cdisgusting\u201d and \u201cpetty\u201d comments by the Dutch minister Wopke Hoekstra, while the Spanish foreign minister, Arancha Gonz\u00e1lez, wondered whether the Dutch understood that \u201ca first-class cabin would not protect you when the whole ship sinks\u201d.\n\nThe former Italian prime minister Enrico Letta has been scathing about Dutch resistance to helping Italy, telling the Dutch press that the Italian view of the Netherlands has been seriously damaged: \u201cIt did not help that a day after German customs officials stopped a huge amount of masks at the border, Russian trucks carrying relief supplies drove through the streets of Rome and millions of masks were sent from China. Matteo Salvini is waiting for this type of action from the Netherlands and Germany so that he can say: you see, we have no use for the European Union.\u201d\n\nThe EU\u2019s position is not irretrievable. Salvini\u2019s closure agenda has not yet found its footing, since Conte\u2019s popularity does not make the prime minister an easy target. Conte has become the single most popular leader in the history of the Italian republic. Individual German politicians, such as Marian Wendt, have also undone some of the damage by organising for a group of Italians to be flown from Bergamo to Cologne for treatment.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Italy has often felt alone within the EU in its battle against coronavirus. Photograph: Filippo Monteforte/AFP via Getty Images\n\nBut with the death toll mounting across Europe, and the crisis just starting to penetrate Africa, the EU discourse so far has been dominated by an unedifying and highly technical row about how to fund the EU\u2019s economic rescue.\n\nEurope\u2019s chief solace is to look across the Atlantic and watch the daily chaos that is Donald Trump\u2019s evening press conference \u2013 the daily reminder that rational people can plan for anything, except an irrational president. Nathalie Tocci, an adviser to Josep Borrell, the EU foreign affairs chief, wonders whether, much like the 1956 Suez crisis symbolised the ultimate decay of the UK\u2019s global power, coronavirus could mark the \u201cSuez moment\u201d for the US.\n\nBorrell himself insists the EU is finding its feet after a rocky start and the case for cooperation is being won. Writing in Project Syndicate, he claims: \u201cAfter a first phase of diverging national decisions, we are now entering a phase of convergence in which the EU takes centre stage. The world initially met the crisis in an uncoordinated fashion, with too many countries ignoring the warning signs and going it alone. It is now clear that the only way out of it is together.\u201d\n\nHe may be proved right, but at the moment the scales are evenly balanced.

I think it comes from an overwhelming desire from our teachers, who believe in public service, to make a difference.\u201d\n\nThe visors have been sent to local hospitals, paramedics and GP surgeries, as well as alumni working on the frontline.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Staff at Harrogate district hospital wear visors made at Harrogate grammar school Photograph: Harrogate grammar school/Guardian Community\n\nJack Sheriff, who left the school in 2014, is a junior doctor on a coronavirus ward in the Midlands, and received a pack of six visors last week, stamped with the school\u2019s emblem, the NHS logo, and the message \u201cwe stand together\u201d.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt\u2019s really nice to have contact with people from your past who helped you get to where you are, and who are still supporting you and thinking of you. It\u2019s a bit of a blast from the past to be under that logo again, and nice to be using the visors made by the laser cutter I used at school.\u201d\n\nSchools are used to providing support for their more vulnerable students but since the crisis, extraordinary efforts are being made to help communities.\n\nAt Meadowfield primary school in Leeds, almost half the students are entitled to free school meals. As well as providing hot meals for families to collect each day, the school has sent out 145 food parcels containing enough supplies for two weeks, with the aim of sustaining vulnerable families over the Easter holidays.\n\nThe headteacher, Helen Stout, said: \u201cThe butchers we use as a supplier have offered to give us bacon and sausages, and the local grocers have offered to do some delivery for us. People have been really kind and benevolent, and it\u2019s nice to know we\u2019re doing our bit.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s become a bit of a different role.

In response, the school asked for tributes to NHS staff to share on social media, and have been overwhelmed with the response. Along with the tributes, the school set up a fundraiser for their local hospital, with a target of \u00a3500 \u2013 a figure that has been trebled in just two days.\n\n\u201cIt really has taken on a life of its own,\u201d said Orla Donnelly, the vice-principal. \u201cWe\u2019ve been swamped with people paying tribute to NHS workers, saying what they\u2019re doing and why they\u2019re so proud.

I put a post on Facebook to our medical school society and within three days I had received 400 responses to be volunteers from not only medical students, but other healthcare students like nurses and speech therapists.\u201d\n\nOther medical students have been joining the NHS prematurely, taking a combination of paid and voluntary roles in hospitals to support the strained service.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been at medical school for five years, and the last two years I\u2019ve been in a purely clinical setting, so I\u2019m familiar with hospitals,\u201d said Phoebe Gray, a penultimate-year medical student who signed up to work at her local hospital in Bristol on the day her exams were cancelled. \u201cIt seemed silly just to sit around.

Show Hide What is Covid-19? Covid-19 is caused by a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic. What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes? According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment. About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19. In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either: a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back\n\na new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system. Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough? Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities. In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should stay at home for at least 7 days. If you live with other people, they should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.\n\nThe Huanan seafood wholesale market in central Wuhan was the kind of place where people often caught colds. Vendors started setting up as early as 3am, plunging their hands into buckets of cold water as they cleaned and prepared produce for the customers that arrived every morning.\n\nThe sprawling market of more than 20 streets spanned two sides of a main road in an upscale neighbourhood of the commercial district of Hankou. Racks of meat were hung on hooks or spilled out on plastic mats. Workers walked around in welly boots. Drains lined the kerb alongside stores selling everything from live poultry to seafood and cooking ingredients. It was crowded but clean.\n\nSo, in mid-December when Lan, who sold dried seafood at one of more than 1,000 stalls in Huanan, felt unwell, he thought little of it.\n\nHe stayed home to rest but after losing 3kg in just a few days, he decided to go to his regular hospital for a check up.\n\nFrom there he was sent to a hospital that specialises in infectious diseases and was admitted on 19 December. He remembers how the staff praised his positive attitude. \u201cI was just a little bit sick. I wasn\u2019t scared in the slightest,\u201d said Lan, who asked not to disclose his full name.\n\nLan could not have known then that he was among the first cases of a new, highly contagious coronavirus that would kill more than 2,500 people in his city and engulf the world, infecting more than 1.6 million people so far and killing more than 95,000. The World Health Organization has described the outbreak of Covid-19 as the worst global crisis since the second world war. \u201cI thought I had a cold. I had no idea,\u201d he said.\n\nCoronavirus infections began cropping up in Wuhan in December \u2013 and reportedly as early as November \u2013 but the Chinese authorities did not inform the public that the virus could pass between humans until late January.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A makeshift Intensive care unit in February at the Red Cross hospital in Wuhan where many patients were in critical condition. Photograph: Gerry Yin/The Guardian\n\nNow, as China celebrates what it claims is victory over the disease, the number of infections and deaths is increasing around the world. Officials from Australia, the US and the UK have accused Beijing of suppressing information, allowing a localised outbreak to turn into a pandemic.\n\nBeijing claims its strict lockdowns bought the world time that health authorities in some countries chose to squander. But interviews with early patients, medical workers and residents, as well as leaked internal documents, accounts from whistleblowers and research studies, show delays in the first few weeks of the epidemic, government missteps that would have far-reaching consequences.\n\nHuman-to-human transmission\n\nBy the end of December, before Lan recovered after more than 20 days in hospital, word had gotten out in Wuhan about a mystery illness. Internet users circulated screenshots of a WeChat conversation on 30 December in which a doctor at Wuhan Red Cross hospital, Liu Wen, warned colleagues of confirmed cases of a contagious coronavirus at another hospital. \u201cWash your hands! Face masks! Gloves!\u201d the medic wrote.\n\nThat same day an ophthalmologist at Wuhan central hospital named Li Wenliang told a WeChat group of former medical school classmates that seven people at his hospital had contracted what he believed to be Sars, the outbreak that killed more than 600 people in mainland China and Hong Kong in 2002-03.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest An intensive care unit at the Red Cross hospital in Wuhan in mid-February. Photograph: Gerry Yin/The Guardian\n\nAn \u201curgent notice\u201d from the Wuhan health commission warning of \u201csuccessive cases of unknown pneumonia\u201d was also leaked and posted online on 30 December. The statement ordered hospitals to \u201cstrengthen responsible leadership\u201d and ensure that no one \u201cdisclose information to the public without authorisation.\u201d\n\nUnder growing pressure, the following day the health commission said researchers were investigating 27 cases of viral pneumonia, its first official notice about the virus. There was no \u201cobvious evidence of human-to-human transmission,\u201d the statement said, describing the outbreak as linked to the seafood market and assuring the public that all patients had been quarantined and their contacts placed under observation. \u201cThe disease is preventable and controllable,\u201d it added.\n\nA day later, on 1 January, the Huanan seafood market was closed and Wuhan\u2019s public security bureau announced that eight people had been \u201cpunished\u201d for spreading rumours. Authorities also tasked hospitals to screen for pneumonia cases linked to the market. It wasn\u2019t until 20 January that vendors in the market were asked to submit to temperature checks and blood tests.\n\nBut across the Yangtze River, some 6 miles (10km) away, people who had never been to the market were falling sick. In the second week of January, Coco Han, 22, developed a cough she couldn\u2019t shake.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Coco Han, 22, in Wuhan. Photograph: Gerry Yin\n\nAfter a week, she went to see her local clinic on 20 January and had a CT scan done. The results showed an infection on her lungs. A medic in a full hazmat suit escorted her to another hospital for more tests.\n\nHan\u2019s mother joined her in a crowded waiting room where those waiting began to panic. Han had a mask but her mother had not thought to wear one, given the government\u2019s assurance. A young woman in line in front of them fainted and Han\u2019s mother hugged her, telling Han not to look.\n\n\u201cWe all knew we might have the virus. Everyone was scared,\u201d Han said. \u201cI think the doctors knew it was transmissible between humans or they wouldn\u2019t have sat so far from us and kept the windows open.\u201d\n\nWhile Han was told that she probably had \u201cthat pneumonia\u201d, she was not able to confirm the diagnosis because the hospital was not authorised to do so, an issue many early patients faced. She was told to go home and self-quarantine but the doctors prescribed her medicine that she had to renew every three days at the hospital, waiting in line with others.\n\n\u201cI was extremely worried I was passing it to others, but I couldn\u2019t let my parents go somewhere so dangerous,\u201d she said.\n\nDaron Hu, 35, who also had never been to the Huanan seafood market, began to feel feverish and dizzy on 16 January. He thought he was just hungover after a few drinks the previous night. Three days later, still unwell, he took a train to Jiangsu province for a work trip. He travelled back to Wuhan and from there returned to his hometown a few hours to the south.\n\nBy the time Hu was admitted into his local hospital, a team of researchers sent by the central government had arrived in Wuhan. Zhong Nanshan, a top respiratory expert famous for countering the government narrative on Sars, said on the evening of 20 January that there had already been cases of human-to-human transmission.\n\nHu, who at his worst point suffered diarrhoea and breathing troubles in addition to a fever and a cough, told his family that he was fine. But over the next 24 days in the hospital, at least three other patients died. He considered writing a will. \u201cI saw some people give up. It is very lonely,\u201d Hu said.\n\n\u2018Things felt out of control\u2019\n\nBy the time officials revealed the infectiousness of the virus, hospitals in Wuhan were already overwhelmed and the numbers increased after the announcement. Video taken on 22 and 23 January showed crowds of patients at Wuhan No 6 hospital in Wuchang, another district of Wuhan.\n\n\u201cIt was so busy. We couldn\u2019t go home,\u201d said a nurse who slept in the hospital dormitory and rotated every four hours in a team of six people to keep up.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest On 28 March 28 the subway in Wuhan resumed operation after two months of being closed. Photograph: Gerry Yin/The Guardian\n\nAnother medic gestured to the sidewalk outside the hospital. \u201cThis was all full,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery day people were dying.\u201d\n\nOn 23 January, the city of 11 million people was placed under lockdown. Surrounding areas followed suit, putting a total of more than 50 million people under de-facto home quarantine.\n\nFacing severe shortages of supplies, staff and space, the next few weeks were desperate. Hospitals turned away patients, sending them home where they often infected their families. Footage showed medics weeping and people collapsed in the streets. Dead bodies were left in hospitals where staff were too busy to collect them. Internet forums filled with pages of pleas for help by residents trying to save loved ones. By 19 February, the death toll from the virus had passed 2,000.\n\n\u201cThe virus was very quick. At the beginning, things felt out of control. We didn\u2019t know what would happen,\u201d said one doctor treating coronavirus patients at Wuhan central hospital, who asked not to be named because he was not given permission to speak to media.\n\nIt is a time authorities are quick to gloss over as they celebrate the lifting of Wuhan\u2019s almost three-month lockdown, an event marked with light shows and banners hailing the success of the \u201cpeople\u2019s war\u201d.\n\n\u201cBeijing has been working very hard to fight the negative domestic and international fallout,\u201d said Ho-Fung Hung, a professor in political economy at Johns Hopkins University.\n\n\u201cBut this is far from adequate in stopping people from discussing China\u2019s responsibility in covering up the outbreak in the beginning,\u201d he said.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest On 8 April the Wuhan Gongjialing toll station reopens as authorities lift traffic restrictions after 76 days of lockdown in which residents were not allowed to leave the city. Photograph: Gerry Yin/The Guardian\n\nWuhan is slowly coming back to life. Neighbourhoods have erected flags and signs declaring them \u201cvirus free\u201d. Cars are starting to fill the streets again as people return to work. Yet, visible reminders of the epidemic remain. Rows of tall metal fencing surround the still-shuttered Huanan seafood market, its former entrances manned by security while police cars patrol nearby.\n\nAnd not everyone is willing to forget. On a wall near her home, Han recently spray-painted the Chinese characters bu neng, bu mingbai (I cannot, I do not understand), a reference to a declaration Li Wenliang, the whistleblower doctor, was forced to sign before eventually succumbing to the virus he tried to warn others about. Underneath the words, some residents have burned piles of paper money, a way to honour the dead, drawing small white circles around the ashes.\n\n\u201cThey said stay. I stayed. They said everything was fine. I believed. I believed it all,\u201d Han says. \u201cI want to know why this happened. Who said not to tell people?\u201d\n\n\u201cI will remember this for the rest of my life \u2013 I understand now that we are not important.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by Lillian Yang and Jiahui Huang", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/10/birth-of-a-pandemic-inside-the-first-weeks-of-the-coronavirus-outbreak-in-wuhan", "published": "2020-04-10T00:00:00", "author": ["Lily Kuo"]}, {"title": "Tech giants struggle to stem 'infodemic' of false coronavirus claims", "text": "Critics say efforts are too little, too late as research reveals vast majority of false claims appear online\n\nClick over to Google, type in \u201ccoronavirus\u201d, and press enter.\n\nThe results you see will bear little resemblance to any other search.\n\nThere are no ads, no product recommendations, and no links to websites that have figured out how to win the search engine optimisation game.

Yet still misinformation continues to adapt and spread, largely on social media.\n\nResearch by Oxford\u2019s Reuters Institute looking at the spread of 225 false or misleading claims about coronavirus found 88% of the claims had appeared on social media platforms, compared with 9% on television or 8% in news outlets.\n\nNearly 30% of US adults believe Covid-19 was developed in a lab, according to a survey by Pew Research Center.\n\nA conspiracy theory falsely linking 5G to the coronavirus pandemic has led to real-world consequences, including threats and harassment against telecom engineers and petrol bomb attacks on telephone poles.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A 5G mast damaged by fire in Birmingham, UK.\n\nPhotograph: Carl Recine/Reuters\n\nCarl Bergstrom, a University of Washington professor of biology who also studies and has written a book about misinformation, says the efforts of the social media companies are too little, too late.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve built this whole ecosystem that is all about engagement, allows viral spread, and hasn\u2019t ever put any currency on accuracy,\u201d he said. \u201cNow all of a sudden we have a serious global crisis, and they want to put some Band-Aids on it. It\u2019s better than not acting, but praising them for doing it is like praising Philip Morris for putting filters on cigarettes.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ve seen the US government becoming a significant purveyor of misinformation around the virus Carl Bergstrom\n\nSome of the more radical steps taken by tech companies include Twitter\u2019s new policy to remove misinformation that contradicts official public health advice, such as tweets encouraging people not to follow physical distancing guidelines, and WhatsApp\u2019s strict new limits on message forwarding.\n\nThe platforms feel they can be much more aggressive on coronavirus misinformation than they have been on political misinformation, said Claire Wardle of the non-profit organisation First Draft.\n\n\u201cThere are no two sides with coronavirus, so they don\u2019t have people on the other side saying: \u2018We want this,\u2019 the way you do with anti-vaxxers or political misinformation,\u201d said Wardle. \u201cThey are freer to act.\u201d\n\nIt is also relatively simple and straightforward for the platforms to select trusted sources of authoritative information \u2013 the WHO, NHS, CDC, etc \u2013 without appearing politically biased.\n\nCoronavirus world map: which countries have the most cases and deaths?

Facebook has long ignored the conspiracy communities that organise using Facebook groups, such as anti-vaxxers, followers of QAnon, and people who believe 5G is harmful. Coronavirus misinformation is rampant in those communities.\n\n\u201cThe sad thing is to see those kinds of conspiracies moving to neighbourhood groups, and family groups,\u201d said Wardle. \u201cIt\u2019s like sparks are flying off the bigger [conspiracy] groups and moving into other groups. Everyone is so frightened right now that it\u2019s a tinderbox and these sparks are coming off and catching fire.\u201d\n\nAnd while the scientific nature of the crisis may lessen some of the external political pressures over how to moderate speech, it also brings with it a slew of challenges. The coronavirus is brand new, and the scientific understanding of it changes daily.\n\nBergstrom described this conundrum as an \u201cuncertainty vacuum\u201d. \u201cAny reasonable authority will not give you a straight answer\u201d to certain questions about the pandemic, \u201cnot because they\u2019re trying to mislead you, but because they don\u2019t know yet,\u201d he said.\n\nAnother complicating factor is that normally trustworthy sources are not providing reliable information.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen the US government, particularly the White House, becoming a significant purveyor of misinformation around the virus,\u201d Bergstrom said.\n\nFacebook and Twitter have removed posts by prominent and powerful people over coronavirus misinformation, including the Brazilian president, Jair Bolsonaro, but the real test of their resolve will be whether they ever take action against misinformation by Trump.\n\n\u201cWe planned for years for this pandemic, but we never realised that we would be fighting a war on two fronts,\u201d said Bergstrom. \u201cOne against the pandemic, and one against all the disinformation and hate and fear that is being amped up and enflamed by political opportunists.\u201d", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/10/tech-giants-struggle-stem-infodemic-false-coronavirus-claims", "published": "2020-04-10T00:00:00", "author": ["Julia Carrie Wong"]}, {"title": "Dominic Cummings timeline: what we know about his movements", "text": "How No 10\u2019s claims about the adviser\u2019s breach of lockdown square with the public record\n\nWhen Dominic Cummings was photographed sprinting out of Downing Street on the same day the prime minister and the health secretary were reported to have developed symptoms of coronavirus, observers might have assumed he was racing to attend to vital matters of state. In retrospect, many will ask whether he was just trying to beat the traffic.\n\nOver the last 72 hours, Downing Street officials, unnamed sources and ministers have attempted to cast doubt on parts of the timeline of Cummings\u2019s travels.\n\nBut an examination of the public record, placed alongside the Guardian and Daily Mirror\u2019s reporting, means that it is possible to lay out the significant claims and counter-claims of the period in question \u2013 and where questions still remain.\n\nFriday 27 March: Downing Street\n\nOn the day Cummings ran out of No 10, his wife, Mary Wakefield, appears to have been already ill, according to her Spectator article about the experience, in which she says: \u201cMy husband did rush home to look after me.\u201d The article did not mention that soon after he rushed home, the family went to the other end of the country.\n\nThe government has briefed that Cummings travelled north before developing symptoms of the virus, which is said to have struck him over the weekend of 28-29 March.\n\nWakefield wrote that Cummings said \u201cI feel weird\u201d and collapsed 24 hours after he came home to look after her, placing their journey north on Friday \u2013 perhaps trying to beat the weekend getaway \u2013 or Saturday at the latest.\n\nThe details of the journey from London remain unclear.\n\nDid he drive or take the train? On Sunday, the cabinet minister Grant Shapps didn\u2019t know. He was asked whether Cummings had stopped for a break at any point on the four-hour journey accompanied by a small child and a sick wife.\n\nDespite being given notice of the question by Sky\u2019s Sophy Ridge the evening before, and having been in contact with Cummings, Shapps was caught flat-footed. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t have detail to the point of what time of day, and how many stops,\u201d he said, adding that he was \u201cexpert\u201d in transport matters and would prefer to talk about the A66.\n\nIn its defence of Cummings, No 10 said the couple had had to travel north in search of childcare from Cummings\u2019s sister and nieces at the property owned by his parents.\n\nThe former Downing Street director of communications Alastair Campbell, among others, described this as guff. He said it was unbelievable that Cummings had to travel 264 miles to get help with childcare.\n\nBut, in the end, Cummings and his wife did not need childcare, No 10 have said, instead relying on the family to deliver food to their door.\n\nTuesday 31 March: Durham\n\nThe police have said that on 31 March they were \u201cmade aware of reports\u201d of Cummings\u2019s presence in the area.\n\nOn Friday, Durham Constabulary told the Guardian and Daily Mirror that they had then contacted the family to \u201creiterate the appropriate advice around essential travel\u201d.\n\nThe statement confirmed \u2013 for the first time \u2013 that Cummings had left London for the north-east.\n\nBut on Saturday, Downing Street insisted the police were wrong. No 10 said that \u201cat no stage was Cummings or his family spoken to by the police about this matter\u201d.\n\nThis version is now under intense scrutiny. Under pressure to explain the differing accounts, police issued a new statement on Saturday and stood by by the original claim.\n\nNot just that, it seems the police might have been alerted to Cummings\u2019s presence in Durham by \u2013 his father. And that it was during this conversation that police had \u201creiterated the appropriate advice around essential travel\u201d.\n\nBy Sunday morning, Shapps was disputing a subtly different point. He told the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr: \u201cFor one thing the father contacted the police, not the other way round\u201d and claiming that security was the \u201ckey thing\u201d in the conversation.\n\nSunday 5 April: The \u2018Abba\u2019 sighting\n\nThe following days, by Wakefield\u2019s account, were a mixture of family idyll and health nightmare, as she made a \u201cpalace out of polystyrene packaging\u201d with their son even as Cummings\u2019s breathing got so bad that she feared he should be in hospital.\n\nBut 10 days after her husband first fell ill, she said, he began to feel better \u2013 just as Boris Johnson went into hospital. That would place the improvement in his condition around Sunday 5 April, although 10 days after the 28th \u2013 the earliest point at which Cummings was said to have been symptomatic \u2013 was 7 April.\n\nThat Sunday, a passerby told the Guardian, they spotted Cummings by sheer chance. The encounter was fleeting but memorable: Cummings was standing outside with his little boy, in \u201cdark coat and thick tartan scarf\u201d, and Abba was playing at full blast.\n\nOn the same day, the Guardian asked Downing Street about the claims. \u201cIt\u2019ll be a \u2018no comment\u2019 on that one,\u201d an official responded. On the Friday of the same week, after establishing further details, the Guardian asked again. Again, the response was no comment.\n\nSunday 12 April: Barnard Castle\n\nWakefield did not mention that on 12 April \u2013 her birthday, according to Companies House records \u2013 they allegedly made a trip to Barnard Castle, a charming town 30 miles from the Cummings\u2019s family property, described on the English Heritage website as having \u201cfantastic views\u201d and \u201cplenty to do for families on a day out\u201d.\n\nThat detail emerged in an interview with Robin Lees, a retired chemistry teacher who lives in the town.\n\nLees, who says he has a photographic memory, told the Guardian he was \u201ca bit gobsmacked\u201d to see Cummings, and then was so incensed that he made a note of the family car\u2019s numberplate and checked it online when he got home.\n\nWhile government officials spent weeks refusing to talk about Cummings\u2019s whereabouts, and have since Saturday sought to dismiss the joint investigation as \u201cfake news\u201d and \u201ca stream of false allegations \u2026 from campaigning newspapers\u201d, they have not disputed Lees\u2019s account.\n\nHis account is awkward for No 10.\n\nOn Saturday, Shapps \u2013 like other Conservatives who defended the prime minister\u2019s most senior aide \u2013 repeatedly emphasised that after the Cummings family had made their journey across the country, they had \u201cstayed put\u201d.\n\nNot according to Lees, they hadn\u2019t. On Sunday, Shapps appeared to change tack.\n\nHe seemed to say that this trip would have come at the end of the quarantine period.\n\nNo mention, however, of the fact this trip would seem to be a clear breach of the strict lockdown rules in place at the time.\n\nWould a journey to a popular day-trip destination on a loved one\u2019s birthday, 30 miles from the lockdown location, constitute essential travel or compliance with the government\u2019s \u201cstay home\u201d instruction?\n\nThat Easter weekend, a new government campaign reminded people that even at a time when people might wish to spend time together, the rules still applied. \u201cThe new campaign reinforces the importance of staying at home over Easter,\u201d it said, reiterating the importance of \u201conly leaving your house to buy essentials, to do one form of exercise a day, to travel into work, but only where you cannot work from home, and for any medical or social care need\u201d.\n\nTuesday 14 April: London\n\nThe 14-day period of Cummings\u2019s isolation would have expired on 10 April, assuming it is counted from when Wakefield appears to have first fallen ill on 27 March. .\n\nIn a piece for the Spectator, the magazine she works for, Wakefield wrote: \u201cWe emerged from quarantine into the almost comical uncertainty of London lockdown.\u201d No clarification, however, that they had actually emerged into the capital from Durham.\n\nThe Guardian asked Wakefield to confirm whether the family had been in London throughout the lockdown period, but received no reply.\n\nCummings was photographed back in Downing Street on 14 April, clutching a bag containing a carton of soup, a tangerine and a carrot.\n\nSunday 19 April: \u2018bluebell\u2019 woods\n\nCould Cummings have then gone back to the north-east from London? Downing Street is emphatic that he did not.\n\nThe denial came after another witness claimed to the Guardian and Sunday Mirror that they had seen Cummings and Wakefield on a country walk in Houghall Woods, a beauty spot near his parents\u2019 property in Durham.\n\nAccording to this account, Cummings said: \u201cAren\u2019t the bluebells lovely?\u201d\n\nWhile Downing Street would give no on-the-record comment before publication of the new stories on Saturday, it then issued a statement.\n\nIt accused the Guardian and the Mirror of writing \u201cinaccurate stories \u2026 including claims that Mr Cummings returned to Durham after returning to work in Downing Street on 14 April.

Johnson courts approval; Cummings disdains it. Yet the prime minister, 55, has come to rely heavily on the 48-year-old Cummings, whom he first witnessed on the political frontline during the EU referendum campaign.\n\nIndeed, there could be no stronger indication of Johnson\u2019s fealty to his adviser than the fact he chose to throw a protective ring of cabinet ministers around him this weekend rather than demand his resignation.\n\nFor much of the tight-knit team around Johnson, that referendum summer of 2016 was the defining moment of their lives \u2013 a David and Goliath struggle in which they pitched themselves against the might of a lavishly-funded remain campaign.\n\nAs Paul Stephenson, Vote Leave\u2019s director of communications, who was present at the Downing Street party, tweeted the next day: \u201cTotal outsiders in a shell of an office took on the entire establishment and won \u2026 and now the gang are making history.\u201d\n\nPaul Stephenson (@P_R_Stephenson) Total outsiders in a shell of an office took on the entire establishment and won.. and now the gang are making history. As a smart lady once said - \u2018Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world; indeed, it's the only thing that ever has\u2019 pic.twitter.com/4xeAMKwiux\n\nThe result vindicated the team\u2019s sense that they understood the concerns of rank-and-file British voters better than many slicker communicators \u2013 David Cameron, George Osborne \u2013 who believed themselves to be masters of the art of politics.\n\nIndeed, in temperament and mindset, the Vote Leavers had much in common with Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s cadre of aides, as they took on Theresa May\u2019s government 12 months later.\n\nThere was an us-against-the-world sense of camaraderie, an appetite for taking risks and an almost gleeful contempt for the political consensus of the past 40 years \u2013 including the tribal party loyalties that usually demarcate Westminster politics.\n\nEton and Oxford-educated Johnson was the Conservative mayor of London when he resigned to join his fortunes with Vote Leave; Cummings too is an Oxford graduate, and his father-in-law owns a castle \u2013 but both believed themselves to be outside the \u201cpolitical elite\u201d.\n\nAnd after their victory in 2016, the Vote Leavers defined themselves and others by which side they had stood on in that torrid summer, and how hard they had fought.\n\nCummings, whose contempt for MPs is legendary, retreated to the sidelines for much of the ensuing three years, as the details of the withdrawal agreement were worked out in negotiations, and then torn to pieces again by the Tory party.\n\nBut after May resigned a year ago and Johnson took over, Cummings\u2019s appointment was one of the first he made \u2013 and sent a clear signal that his would be a Vote Leave government.\n\nWith Brexit still hanging in the balance, Johnson valued Cummings\u2019s absolute commitment to the cause. But with no majority and a deeply divided party, he also knew he would need to fight a general election in short order \u2013 and Cummings is the consummate campaigner.\n\nFor Cummings, the call to Johnson\u2019s side in Downing Street last July was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Not just to \u201cget Brexit done\u201d, the ringing election slogan that party legend says was first uttered by a participant in one of his beloved focus groups, but to pursue his other intellectual preoccupation \u2013 reshaping the British state.\n\nSo total was Cummings\u2019s commitment that he postponed elective surgery in order to take the job.\n\nThe 2019 election manifesto was peppered with his obsessions, from ensuring government made better use of data science to rebalancing the economy away from London and shaking up \u201cthe broader aspects of our constitution\u201d after Brexit.\n\nOther aspects of the programme, including ditching austerity, reflected long-held preoccupations of the prime minister. But it is unclear even to close colleagues what a Johnson prospectus, shorn of Cummings\u2019s influence, would have looked like.\n\nSo perhaps it is not surprising that, despite musing at last year\u2019s Tory conference that he might not return after the general election campaign, Cummings was back at No 10 in January, seeking applications from \u201cweirdos and misfits with odd skills\u201d to work with him in remaking Whitehall.\n\nWith a comfortable majority, there was an opportunity to pursue some of his preoccupations \u2013 including boosting state investment in science and shaking up government departments.\n\nJohnson has not always gone along with Cummings\u2019s wilder schemes: many of the most radical plans for overhauling Whitehall were ditched in place of modest tweaks, for example.\n\nBut Cummings is ever-present, and his ability to slice through the complexities of day-by-day challenges is highly prized by Johnson, who is not known for his attention to detail.\n\nAnd just as for Fiona Hill and Nick Timothy, who served May before being ousted after the 2017 election, and indeed for Corbyn\u2019s chief aide, Seumas Milne, too, the boss\u2019s confidence brings with it immense power.\n\nOne former cabinet minister described Cummings\u2019s attention sweeping across their department like the Eye of Sauron, in The Lord of the Rings.\n\nWhen Boris Johnson carried out a ruthless reshuffle three months ago, it was an open secret that Sajid Javid, the chancellor, resigned more because he had fallen out with Cummings than over any beef with the prime minister.\n\nJavid was told he must sack his aides and instead employ a team hand-picked by Johnson (for which, read Cummings). Instead, he chose to resign. It was such an open secret, in fact, that he subsequently joked in his resignation speech about \u201cCummings and goings\u201d at the heart of government.\n\nMore recently, it was Cummings who sat on the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) as the prime minister\u2019s eyes and ears (and sometimes, it appears, mouthpiece).\n\nAnd insiders say it was Cummings, above all, who persuaded the laissez-faire, anti-nanny state prime minister to go for an all-out lockdown \u2013 not least because his focus groups were telling him the public wanted clear instructions. That now looks ironic, to say the least.", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/24/how-dominic-cummings-became-indispensable-to-boris-johnson", "published": "2020-05-24T00:00:00", "author": ["Heather Stewart", "John Crace"]}, {"title": "Did Dominic Cummings break the law on lockdown rules?", "text": "On 23 March, the prime minister announced a nationwide lockdown to slow the spread of coronavirus. \u201cI must give the British people a very simple instruction \u2013 you must stay at home,\u201d said Boris Johnson. Dominic Cummings certainly ignored that diktat, along with government guidance not to travel anywhere else to self-isolate. But did he break the law?\n\nOn 26 March, regulations were introduced in England that made it an offence to leave home without a \u201creasonable excuse\u201d and to gather in groups of more than two. The Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) (England) Regulations 2020 gave police powers to forcibly return those who refused to comply with the lockdown to their homes and issue fines to dissenters.\n\nWe know Cummings went to Durham after the regulations came into force. He was seen running away from Downing Street on 27 March and was definitely in Durham by 31 March, when officers from the local police force spoke to his father.\n\nDowning Street has not contradicted a witness who told the Guardian they also saw Cummings in Barnard Castle, 30 miles from Durham, on 12 April.\n\nWhether he contravened the regulations depends on the definition of \u201creasonable excuse\u201d. The regulations do not define the term but they do provide non-exhaustive lists of reasonable excuses to be outside, such as shopping for necessities, doing exercise and travelling to and from work.\n\nEven when Boris Johnson announced a slight relaxation of lockdown in England on 11 May \u2013 when he said \u201cyou can drive as far as you like to reach an outdoor space\u201d \u2013 that was specifically only for the purpose of exercise.\n\nAsked by reporters on Saturday for her reading of \u201creasonable excuse\u201d, the deputy chief medical officer, Jenny Harries, suggested \u201cextreme risk to life\u201d would fit the bill. \u201cIf you\u2019re symptomatic, you stay at home, take yourself out of society as quickly as you can and stay there, unless there\u2019s extreme risk to life,\u201d she said at the daily press conference.\n\nDowning Street\u2019s statement says Cummings travelled 260 miles north \u201cowing to his wife being infected with suspected coronavirus and the high likelihood that he would himself become unwell. It was essential \u2026 to ensure his young child could be properly cared for.\u201d\n\nThe regulations are clear that had Cummings been stopped by police en route to Durham, officers could have directed him to return to London and fined him. The wording of the regulations says police only need to \u201cconsider\u201d (ie believe) that someone had left home without a reasonable excuse in order to send them back.\n\nThe government had already issued non-legally-binding guidance that said people should not leave home to isolate elsewhere: \u201cEssential travel does not include visits to second homes, campsites, caravan parks or similar, whether for isolation purposes or holidays. People must remain in their primary residence. Not taking these steps puts additional pressure on communities and services that are already at risk.\u201d\n\nTheoretically, police could also have sent Cummings back to London using another new law, the Coronavirus Act 2020, which gave police further powers to remove a potentially infectious person for screening/assessment and also to detain them if they refuse to comply. But whether the police can retrospectively fine someone considered to have broken the rules is unclear.", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/24/did-dominic-cummings-break-the-law-on-lockdown-rules", "published": "2020-05-24T00:00:00", "author": ["Helen Pidd"]}, {"title": "Daniel Andrews: Victoria's dictator, or just a wildly popular, unstoppable political force? | Gay Alcorn", "text": "Victoria\u2019s premier has taken a tougher line on the coronavirus lockdown than anyone, but his state seems to have embraced it\n\nTo listen to the more vociferous critics of Daniel Andrews \u2013 confined mostly to the Murdoch media and a rogue Victorian Liberal MP \u2013 he is a dictator revelling in his power, with \u201ca disturbing streak of authoritarianism\u201d, a premier who wildly exaggerated the risk of Covid-19 and is now deliberately hampering the economic recovery.\n\nIt\u2019s nonsense and wouldn\u2019t matter much except that now is a moment when trust in governments \u2013 at dangerously low levels pre-pandemic \u2013 has tentatively revived. Who would have thought it? Citizens like governments to work through issues using evidence, to be honest about the complexity of challenges, to protect the health and wellbeing of their people. They even like governments of different political hues working together if possible. They loathe transparent point-scoring, and they will forgive inevitable mistakes.\n\nThe sniping against Andrews defies reason. Australia\u2019s health response to the global pandemic has been superb to date, for whatever combination of factors including geography, early social distancing restrictions, the national cabinet process and brave public health advice. The economic recovery will be slow, painful and complicated, and most likely less edifying.\n\nCovid-19 competence has given Australian governments some political capital. But there's a flipside | Katharine Murphy Read more\n\nThese past few months were a moment when the Australian states and territories \u2013 under-scrutinised and undervalued compared with the federal sphere \u2013 have asserted their importance to the federation. State governments of both major parties have performed slightly differently, but exceptionally well by any international comparison. We have had 101 Covid-19 deaths to date. Four people have died per 1 million people in Australia, compared with 597 in Spain, 537 in the UK, and 285 in the US. It\u2019s a stunning achievement.\n\nAndrews is the most experienced of the premiers and has grown in his 10 years as Labor leader, six as premier. He and NSW premier Gladys Berejiklian lead the biggest and most powerful states, which between them have had the largest numbers of coronavirus cases, with 48 deaths in NSW and 18 in Victoria to date.\n\nThe times, as Monash University\u2019s associate professor Paul Strangio points out, play to Andrews\u2019 strengths and style, with the crushing victory in the 2018 state election empowering him further. \u201cHe\u2019s always been prepared to take leadership risks on the calculation that the public prefers decisiveness and assertiveness, rather than vacillation,\u201d Strangio says.\n\n\u2018Not a popularity contest\u2019\n\nVictoria was the most firm among the states in insisting on early shutdowns in March and has been most cautious in reopening its society and economy. It is Victoria, too, that has asserted its independence over its economic relationship with China.\n\nAfter Scott Morrison detailed the national cabinet\u2019s three-stage roadmap for lifting coronavirus restrictions on 8 May \u2013 emphasising that the timing would be at the states\u2019 discretion \u2013 it was Andrews who held firm that no Victorian could visit their mother on Mother\u2019s Day. The state\u2019s announcement on loosening restrictions would not happen until the following week, after a testing blitz could be analysed.\n\nAndrews did begin lifting restrictions, but they remain the tightest in the country. For now, Victorians cannot stay overnight at the home of family or friends \u2013 in every other state, this is allowed. Unlike other states, cafes and restaurants in Victoria are still unable to seat diners, but from next month, they can host up to 20 patrons at a time indoors and, all going well, that will increase as weeks go by. Victoria has been more cautious about students attending school \u2013 some years return on Monday, with all students back by 9 June.\n\nSocial distancing rules explained: Australia's current state by state coronavirus guidelines Read more\n\nBut these are differences of timing, not substance, and Andrews has explained them this way. He has listened to the advice of the state\u2019s chief health officer, Brett Sutton, and this has been slightly different to national advice. There\u2019s no perfect answer to how to handle this virus, no one set of modelling that sets a roadmap. \u201cThis is not a popularity contest; it\u2019s a pandemic and we\u2019ve got to make good logical decisions, and that\u2019s what I\u2019ve tried to do,\u201d he told ABC radio this week. He\u2019s exercised sound judgment \u201cin a Victorian way \u2013 slow steady cautious\u201d. Opening up needs to be done \u201cproperly and once\u201d.\n\nThe quibbling so far is having no impact on Andrews\u2019 popularity, which will inevitably come under greater pressure as the full economic impact becomes clear. People often rally around a leader at a time of crisis, and all state leaders, as well as Morrison, have seen their support soar.\n\nAn Essential poll last week showed 71% of Victorians rated their government\u2019s performance as good or very good.\n\n\u2018Sticking to his guns\u2019\n\nKosmos Samaras served as Victorian Labor\u2019s deputy campaign director for 14 years until 2019, and now heads RedBridge, a political consultancy. Since March, the company has conducted detailed focus groups around the Covid-19 response, predominantly in Victoria (Samaras says the company has no political or corporate clients for this work).\n\nThe pressure from some commentators to reopen quickly is not supported by the majority of voters, especially those in outer suburbs and regional areas. Samaras says that those now on jobkeeper or jobseeker are also cautious.\n\n\u201cThey understand that if the lockdown is lifted too early or too quickly, we could endure another lockdown and they can\u2019t afford that.\u201d\n\nMorrison\u2019s performance is highly praised, but Andrews stands out. \u201cParticipants from across the political spectrum are praising his actions,\u201d the March report found. \u201cHe is consistently described as \u2018transparent\u2019, \u2018forthright\u2019, \u2018proactive\u201d, \u2018compassionate\u2019 and \u2018assertive\u2019 on behalf of Victorians.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Daniel Andrews has been consistent in following the advice of his chief health officer, Brett Sutton.

This represents a serious values disconnect with voters.\n\n\u201cAndrews\u2019 positive image is only reinforced when others put pressure on him to end the lockdown \u2013 he\u2019s doing the right thing and sticking to his guns with it.\u201d\n\nOn China, voters are not interested in the \u201cblame game\u201d but they are worried about Australia\u2019s \u201cover-dependence\u201d on other countries. They want a more self-sufficient Australia, one that \u201cgoes back to building and making things here\u201d.\n\nPolitical supremacy\n\nAll of which makes the job of an opposition leader tough. Michael O\u2019Brien, a former treasurer, is considered a measured moderate, and became leader of the Liberal party after the devastating election loss of 2018. The party did not expect to win that election, but the 6% swing against them \u2013 especially the desertion of small-l liberal voters in its Melbourne heartland \u2013 highlighted an identity crisis that still persists. The level of personal animosity within the party administration, says one senior Liberal, means \u201cthe Victorian division is regarded as the most dysfunctional\u201d in the country.\n\nThe party\u2019s state conference has been postponed due to the pandemic, and with it, as former ABC presenter Jon Faine wrote recently, \u201cthe deferral of a reckoning\u201d with moderates keen to reduce the influence of rightwing religious activists.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Victorian Liberal MP Tim Smith has frustrated colleagues with his relentless attacks on Andrews. Photograph: Alex Murray/AAP\n\nFederally, the looming vacancy created by Senate president Scott Ryan\u2019s retirement is a test of that, as is a bitter battle over the seat of Menzies, where rightwing veteran Kevin Andrews is resisting pressure to retire.\n\nO\u2019Brien is doing what he can, putting forward policy proposals to help Victoria\u2019s recovery, including exempting small and medium businesses from payroll tax. The government deserves to be scrutinised on many fronts, including the lack of independent oversight over billions in spending, and the $24.5bn in new borrowing the government is proposing, which will more than triple state debt.\n\n\u201cIf we just see budget black holes being filled and paying recurrent expenses like public service wages out of borrowed money, that is the road to economic ruin,\u2019\u2019 O\u2019Brien told the Age recently.\n\nVictoria\u2019s engagement with China over its Belt and Road initiative \u2013 against national policy \u2013 and the suggestion of state treasurer Tim Pallas that Canberra had vilified China by pursuing an independent coronavirus inquiry, has raised eyebrows even among senior Labor figures.\n\nYet O\u2019Brien\u2019s efforts have been undermined from within. Shadow planning minister Tim Smith, a master of self-promotion, has been tweeting away for months, first demanding the resignation of a senior health official for her tweet comparing the coronavirus with Captain Cook\u2019s arrival, and then indulging in almost daily sprays against Andrews. O\u2019Brien had had enough when Smith called the premier \u201cloony\u201d.\n\nSmith is close to the most senior Victorian federal Liberal, treasurer Josh Frydenberg, and no doubt has leadership ambitions, premature for now.

Anyone failing to comply may face enforcement action. A breach of self-isolation would be punishable with a \u00a31,000 fixed penalty notice in England or potential prosecution and unlimited fine.

Primary schools are meant to partly reopen next Monday, but many are in no position to do so; a test-and-tracing regime that should have materialised weeks ago is still frantically being assembled. And then along come the revelations of Dominic Cummings\u2019s wanderings \u2013 ostensibly a tale of one man\u2019s self-importance, but really the story of an unelected courtier whose influence and reputation speak volumes about how broken our system of government now is.\n\nOne recurrent spectacle has defined the last couple of months: ministers, presumably egged on by their advisers, grandly issuing their edicts, only for people to insist that they simply do not match the reality on the ground. The schools story is one example; another was the shambolic and arrogant way that Boris Johnson announced the shift from \u201cstay at home\u201d to \u201cstay alert\u201d, and his call for droves of people to return to work. Watching the leaders of Wales and Scotland insist they had no input into the government\u2019s change of message and then stick to their existing lockdowns was a stark reminder that the UK is continuing to fragment. In England, meanwhile, the council leaders and mayors who were suddenly faced with huge consequences for transport and public health had been caught on the hop. \u201cNo one in government thought it important to tell the cities who\u2019d have to cope,\u201d said the Greater Manchester mayor, Andy Burnham. Nick Forbes, the leader of Newcastle city council, told me last week: \u201cThe first I knew about it was when I saw it on TV.\u201d\n\nFor the opening phase of the crisis, Forbes explained, he had joined a weekly conference call of council leaders and chief executives, addressed by Robert Jenrick, the communities and local government secretary. He is not the only figure from local government who has told me that the calls are now handled by more junior ministers, and are no longer weekly. A few days ago, I spoke to another city leader who said that long-awaited government guidance on arrangements for social care and help for businesses had finally arrived last Friday, ahead of the bank holiday weekend. He also expressed huge frustration about the issue that arguably highlights the shortcomings of our top-down system most glaringly: the supposed arrival of a \u201cworld-beating\u201d testing and tracing system by next Monday, and the ongoing saga of how it will work and who will run it.\n\nOn testing, rather than following the kind of devolved, pluralistic model that has worked so well in Germany, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, has so far stuck to the usual centralised script, something exemplified by the drive-through testing centres contracted at speed to such private companies as Deloitte, Sodexo and Boots, and often situated in inappropriate locations. On its hobbling progress towards a system of contact tracing, the government at first followed much the same logic, attempting a centralised system of call centres involving such private companies as the outsourcing giant Serco, staffed by new recruits who had apparently been given the most cursory training.\n\nThe councils who have the kind of forensic local knowledge and experience any tracing efforts will depend on were at first left in the dark. Then, less than three weeks before the system was meant to be in place, it was announced that the chief executive of Leeds city council had been made \u201cnational lead on tracing\u201d, and that councils and their public health directors were to have a role after all. Throughout last week, senior people in city and local government were still telling me that though this sounded positive, they had no clear idea of what they were going to be asked to do. But on Friday afternoon, the government announced that councils would be working with Whitehall \u201cto support test and trace services in their local communities\u201d and \u201cdevelop tailored outbreak control plans\u201d.\n\nAs one city leader told me, the announcement came at \u201cone minute to midnight\u201d. The \u00a3300m that was now allocated to English councils for the work was, he said, \u201ccompletely pitiful\u201d. The thinking at work was plain: seemingly in a fit of panic, the people who run cities, counties and boroughs had been belatedly tacked on to a plan that should have had them at its core all along. Perhaps the most painful thing was that this mistreatment was hardly a surprise: if councils are suddenly being praised by ministers, it hardly makes up for a decade of savage cuts to basic local services, an aspect of the Covid-19 crisis that is still overlooked.\n\nWhich brings us to the subject too often obscured by the government\u2019s convulsions: money. Two weeks ago, the Yorkshire Post reported on the prospect of \u201cmany of the 22 local authorities in the Yorkshire and the Humber region making a choreographed joint declaration that they have run out of money\u201d. In Newcastle, Forbes told me the city council now faced an in-year financial gap of \u00a345.5m. When ministers and their cheerleaders announce this or that funding boost and insist there will be no return to austerity, it is worth bearing in mind that austerity is still an ongoing reality for large chunks of the country.\n\nJust about every aspect of our current national impasse proves that the old centralised game is up, and that England needs a new constitutional settlement. This does not strike me as a left/right issue, unless you are the kind of Tory who thinks that the neglect and outright destruction of local government ought to be a necessary part of your politics. Power needs to be taken from the centre and dispersed: the future needs to be founded on a huge boost to councils\u2019 share of the tax take, the devolution of everything from health to transport, and fully localised responses to any future emergencies. If we do not begin this revolution soon, we will carry on bumbling from one crisis to the next, as Whitehall and Westminster fall into more scandal and disgrace and the commands barked from on high continue to fade into white noise.\n\n\u2022 John Harris is a Guardian columnist", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/25/pandemic-failings-centralised-state-councils-coronavirus", "published": "2020-05-25T00:00:00", "author": ["John Harris"]}, {"title": "The NHS surcharge for migrant staff is gone. Why did it take such a fight? | Nesrine Malik", "text": "The first two doctors to die of Covid-19 on the NHS frontline were born in Sudan. In the Sudanese capital, Khartoum, there is a loan shark. Until last week, junior doctors with job offers in the UK represented a reliable income stream for him. The work visas they needed came with a host of conditions, but meeting those criteria counted for nothing unless they paid, upfront, an immigration health surcharge of \u00a3400 a year for every year of their work permit, duplicated for every member of their family if they had one.\n\nBeing recent graduates, most applicants had only pennies to their name. So the loan shark thrived, demanding an interest payment in advance, before personally entering his credit card details into the online application form.\n\nHis business may now be in trouble. On Thursday, the British government gave in to mounting pressure and exempted migrant NHS staff from the surcharge. This wasn\u2019t an easily won concession. Cancelling the surcharge before the anger had reached its own backbenches could have been an early and obvious win. But that\u2019s not how this government, or its Home Office, works.\n\nThe surcharge is (not was, as it is still paid by non-NHS migrants, many on low incomes and with few public advocates) not only outrageously costly, it is also immoral. Migrants pay taxes and national insurance contributions. Subjecting them to an additional charge to use an NHS they have already contributed to amounts to exploitation.\n\nThe fact that the government will not offer an exemption for people on low incomes, or deviate from its demand to pay in one lump sum, is a familiar feature of Home Office fee design. The policy is to put immigrants on the spot and extract as much as possible from them. On the other side of these fees there are jobs, training opportunities, university offers, spouses, partners and other loved ones to join. If you\u2019re in the country already, the downside of failing to pay such fees renders them close to extortion. Refusing to stump up means having to take your life apart and leaving the country. What\u2019ll it be: your money or your life?\n\nI and many friends and family members have often had to make these kinds of decisions over the years. In the middle of a long, chaotic and insulting immigration experience you put your dignity, mental health and financial stability on the one hand; and the intricate, rich life you have built in this country on the other. The scales just about balance. This is what the government bets on.\n\nAs a result, it has built an immigration system that is geared not towards what is fair, but what it can get away with. And that is a lot. If one looks back over the last decade, two policies, austerity and the hostile environment, have defined the Conservative political agenda. The party not only managed to drive them through undiluted, it also spun these policies\u2019 failures, to achieve prosperity or a reduction in immigration numbers, as success.\n\nIt is no surprise then that it took such a fight to convince the government to exempt NHS staff from the surcharge even as they were fighting a pandemic. Its commitment to the policy was never about money: numbers suggests that NHS staff contributions only bring in a measly \u00a335m a year (not Boris Johnson\u2019s deliberately inflated number of almost a billion).\n\nThe Tory party\u2019s own MPs and peers condemned it. Politically, the surcharge put the government to the right of Ukip and at odds with the Daily Mail. But a habit forged over a decade is hard to quit overnight. The political software of nimble review and reform does not exist in the Home Office. In fact, it is inimical to the smooth running of the hostile environment, which is a complex policy infrastructure that is built for inflexibility. Combine that with this new government\u2019s rapid centralisation, fondness for unsubtle apparatchiks like Priti Patel, disdain for the civil service, plus a dash of incompetence, and you end up with an administration that responds to nothing but public shaming.\n\nIncreasingly, the only way to get the Conservatives to ditch unethical policies is to provoke national outrage. The victims of the policies have to suffer, and then drag their pain and anger into the public realm and petition for mercy. Whether it is the suspension of Windrush deportations, free parking for NHS doctors, extending indefinite leave to remain to the families of all NHS staff, or this latest concession, the government only changed course when it became too embarrassing not to. There is no moral compass, no sense of responsibility over lives in its care, just a cynical cost-benefit analysis of which policies are worth the harassment in the media and at the dispatch box and which are not.\n\nBut we get them to move. One win at a time. It does mean, though, that we can only focus on one injustice at a time. The NHS surcharge may have saved junior doctors from a loan shark in Khartoum. But with every victory a question hangs: what about the others trapped in the latticework of the government\u2019s meanness and incompetence, suffering in ways that will probably never come to light?\n\n\u2022 Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnist", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/25/nhs-surcharge-migrant-staff-government-campaign", "published": "2020-05-25T00:00:00", "author": ["Nesrine Malik"]}, {"title": "Our suicide research is clear: Australia needs more urgent action to address the Covid-19 fallout | Ian Hickie", "text": "The potential mental health and suicide impacts resulting from the massive economic and social dislocation caused by Covid-19 are front and centre internationally. In Australia the prime minister, Scott Morrison, has repeated his personal commitment to minimising these effects, and particularly to preventing youth suicide. In reality, however, his government has been awaiting the final report of the Productivity Commission before considering any serious reform to our highly dysfunctional mental health system.\n\nIn the last two weeks, the PM\u2019s pre-Covid-19 mental health plan (much like his economic agenda) has been blown way off course by the harsh reality of the current crisis. In response to the predicted 25-50% increase in suicides over the next five years (released by the Brain and Mind Centre), the health minister, Greg Hunt, appointed a new deputy chief medical officer for mental health, Dr Ruth Vine, to support the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee (AHPPC). For the first time, Covid-19-precipitated mental ill health was given the same status as physical ill health.\n\nStress, isolation, suicide: Australia's new mental health officer on the challenges of Covid-19 Read more\n\nAs was the case early in the pandemic, our statistical modelling of mental ill health and suicides is designed to assist the AHPPC to develop the best possible medical advice. The modelling emphasises the extent to which those in rural and regional areas are at high risk, due to higher pre-existing rates of suicide, youth unemployment and lower educational achievement. Unlike other national crises, such as wars (where unemployment and suicide rates go down), economic recessions preferentially hurt those who are already most vulnerable.\n\nMost importantly, the modelling details what economic, social and health measures have the greatest prospects for preventing catastrophic outcomes. Top of the list are the effectiveness of jobkeeper and jobseeker. Do they really connect with those who are most at risk, particularly in rural and regional Australia? Educational and training supports for young people are critical. Preventing further social dislocation, largely by supporting employment, education and welfare recipients over the longer-term, really matters.\n\nAlthough economic and social interventions have the most benefits, a functional mental health system is an essential safety net. However, not all initiatives are equally useful. Public awareness campaigns, helplines and more entry systems that do not connect with specialised care are of little value. Rather bizarrely, given the commonwealth\u2019s previous investments in 2019 in a national campaign (#YouCanTalk), we are now being cautioned against open discussion of suicide or the scale of the challenge we face. Many have retreated to the discredited approach that open discussion undermines hope or generates a self-fulfilling prophecy.\n\nBy contrast, the modelling emphasises that the big ticket items that work are more specialised care outside of hospitals, aftercare of those who have self-harmed and information-technology based coordination and delivery of care. Urgent reform of the Medicare schedules, public purchasing of specialist services from the private sector and direct financial support for state services are all essential.\n\nSo, what has been the Morrison government\u2019s response? Following national cabinet on 15 May, Hunt released a National Mental Health and Wellbeing Pandemic Response Plan, detailing 10 priorities, three enablers, seven principles and 75 actions. The key outcome, as described by Morrison\u2019s suicide prevention adviser, Christine Morgan, (who is also the CEO of the national mental health commission) was simply reaching an agreement with the states and territories. No implementation timetable or scale of investment is described. No urgency to make the key structural decisions or finance the key priorities is evident.\n\nConcurrently, Hunt reported no increase in suicide in three states so far this year \u2013 that is, for the period prior to the economic impacts of Covid-19. From a modelling perspective, however, the key number is the number of people who have lost their jobs, now estimated at more than 600,000. All other real-time mental health measures (eg national surveys of mental distress, calls to helplines) are heading up.\n\nNational cabinet meets as coronavirus restrictions ease across Australia Read more\n\nWhile the commonwealth announced $48.1m in additional funding, including $10.4m for another national communications strategy, none of the funded measures have any specific relationship to the big ticket items suggested by the modelling.\n\nOn Monday, Hunt announced the outcomes of previous research grants, including $17m in awards to various academic institutions to conduct mental health and suicide prevention research. Another round of $3m in new grant applications was also announced. While investments in mental health research are always welcome, these announcements do not constitute any new investments in the services recommended by the modelling.\n\nIn recent public comments, Dr Vine has stated that she is not aware of the details of the modelling. Morgan has emphasised the need to focus on hope and enhanced social connectedness.\n\nThe clear questions that need to be answered are: Just what actions are our national cabinet planning to take and with what urgency? Are they committed to taking those economic, social and health services actions that will have the greatest impact? As decisive and timely actions are not yet on the agenda, many are left to ask: if not now, when?\n\n\u2022 Professor Ian Hickie AM is co-director health and policy, Brain and Mind Centre, University of Sydney and former national mental health commissioner (2012-18)\n\n\u2022 Comments on this piece are premoderated to ensure discussion remains on topics raised by the writer.

Unlike his predecessors, he does not try to exercise global influence by asserting control over international agencies; instead, convinced that such bodies undermine the US\u2019s authority, he tries to ruin them.\n\nThis approach was on display last week, when he threatened to stop funding the World Health Organization within 30 days if it does not agree to unspecified reforms.\n\nBut the pandemic has also demonstrated the threat to global order posed by Xi\u2019s China, the world\u2019s other great power.\n\nThe cover-up of the initial outbreak in Wuhan and the unreliability of information released by Beijing have demonstrated that it is not just China\u2019s residents \u2013 particularly its ethnic minorities \u2013 who will suffer the consequences of Xi\u2019s increasingly repressive, secretive rule.\n\nIn a testy post-Covid-19 world, Chinese sanctions of Australian goods may be closer than ever | Richard McGregor Read more\n\nThis leaves Australia in uncomfortable and unfamiliar territory. It has committed troops to each of the US\u2019s major conflicts since the second world war to prove its worth as a security ally, but Washington is adding to the instability that the alliance was designed to prevent.\n\nMeanwhile, Australia\u2019s economy has become one of the most dependent on China in the developed world. Today, relying on these two great powers as sources of security and prosperity seems increasingly risky. Australia will frequently need to find new partners, or act alone.\n\nUnfortunately, the recent response by prime minister Scott Morrison and foreign minister Marise Payne to this predicament \u2013 their push for an inquiry into the origins of Covid-19 \u2013 was a mishandled mess.\n\nIt not only raises concerns about whether Canberra can competently deal with its emerging diplomatic challenge but \u2013 as Australia now faces a trade backlash from China \u2013 it also shows the potential costs of failure.\n\nThe call for the inquiry was announced by Payne last month in an interview on ABC\u2019s Insiders in which she appeared to blame China and the World Health Organization \u2013 a position that seemed to echo the White House\u2019s increasingly strident rhetoric. But it quickly emerged that Canberra had not tried to rally support for the proposal.\n\nThis left Australia as a lone voice on the international stage \u2013 a situation that unnecessarily exposed it to Beijing\u2019s fury.\n\nAustralia, in the past three years, has prided itself on being the first country in the world to introduce comprehensive laws aimed at curbing Chinese foreign interference and was the first country to completely ban Huawei from participating in its 5G network. But this made it harder for Canberra to try to persuade China that it was not the target of an inquiry, and more likely that Beijing would react with venom.\n\nTo gather backing for the inquiry, Morrison called Trump, who showed support, and European leaders, who were reluctant to proceed while they were in the grip of domestic Covid-19 outbreaks. Morrison and Payne made no apparent attempt to discuss the proposed inquiry with Beijing, but insisted that China must cooperate.\n\nChinese officials and state media reacted furiously, and with typically churlish aggression. China\u2019s ambassador to Australia warned that Chinese consumers may boycott Australian wine and beef \u2013 and, several weeks later, China cut imports from four Australian abattoirs. It has since imposed 80% tariffs on Australian barley, and has reportedly moved to restrict imports of Australian coal.\n\nChina did not link these moves to the inquiry. It said the beef ban was due to health and safety concerns, the coal restrictions were to support domestic suppliers, and the barley tariffs followed an investigation launched in November 2018 into claims Australia has been deliberately selling the barley cheaply. As is often the case with China, the exact reason for its decisions remain unclear.\n\nIn the end, Australia dropped its proposal for an inquiry which would be conducted outside the WHO. Instead, it did what it should have done all along \u2013 worked alongside like-minded nations to win broad support for an inquiry.\n\nIt backed a European Union resolution for an independent inquiry that will be conducted by the WHO\u2019s oversight committee, which is chaired by Dr Felicity Harvey, a visiting professor at Imperial College London. Unlike Australia, the EU was not subject to Chinese retribution.\n\nChina eventually became a co-sponsor of the proposal, which was passed unanimously by the WHO\u2019s 194-member governing body. Notably, Xi, unlike Trump, accepted an invitation to appear before the body.\n\nMorrison and the cabinet were right to push for an inquiry. Of course, the world needs to understand this pandemic. And countries such as Australia \u2013 which has the world\u2019s 13th-largest economy - should be willing to lead the push for international action.\n\nBut, in this new global environment of mistrust and disorder, Australia will need to change the way it operates. It will increasingly need to act without counting on US support, particularly as some of Trump\u2019s stances \u2013 especially his tilt towards protectionism \u2013 gain traction in Washington.\n\nIt will need to take a more active role in bodies such as the WHO, especially as the US turns it back on such agencies and China tries to assume the mantle of leader. But Australia should allow China an opportunity to act in good faith, rather than provide Beijing with a justification for belligerence. And it will need to consult with other partners, which may be wary of moves that goad China.\n\nThis is not beyond Australia\u2019s leaders or diplomats. But it will require the government to avoid taking positions that unnecessarily stoke US-China tensions or damage ties with Beijing.\n\nNor should its messages be designed to suit domestic audiences, or dropped without warning in a Sunday morning interview.", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/25/australia-has-unnecessarily-exposed-itself-to-beijings-fury-but-relying-on-the-us-now-is-risky", "published": "2020-05-25T00:00:00", "author": ["Jonathan Pearlman"]}, {"title": "Hottest front-room seats: the best theatre and dance to watch online", "text": "From live-streams of new plays to classics from the archive, here are some of the top shows online now or coming soon \u2013 this page is updated daily\n\nNational Theatre at Home\n\nThe National has risen to the occasion by unveiling a mighty lineup of some of its greatest NT Live hits, to be streamed online on Thursdays at 7pm and then available for seven days.

Feel the rising panic and despair in Rockaby as the solitary, wide-eyed Hunter recounts a descent through long, lonely days.\n\nPalermo Palermo\n\nEven by Pina Bausch\u2019s standards it\u2019s an arresting opening: a huge wall collapses on stage and across the rubble comes Julie Shanahan, in high heels and a floral frock. After desperately commanding hugs from two suitors, she takes a seat and is pelted with rotten tomatoes. And so begins an epic patchwork of masochistic rituals, nightmares and games, blending the quotidian with the phenomenal, all inspired by the choreographer\u2019s trip to Sicily.

Bausch\u2019s company memorably balanced apples on their heads in Palermo Palermo, but as Smashed is created by those juggling supremos Gandini, the fruit is mostly in motion here. Their Bausch homage has the same childlike games, adult fantasy and bruised humour of the German choreographer\u2019s work. Smashed is crisp, fresh and full of flavour. You may never look at an apple in the same way again \u2026\n\nOscar Wilde season\n\nAll four productions in Classic Spring\u2019s starry Oscar Wilde season in the West End can be watched on the online service Marquee TV, which is offering a 14-day free trial.

Alternately rousing and yearning, this is a gorgeous hymn to barflies, precious memories and the joys of being a ghost, told with a dash of Edgar Allan Poe and Thelonious Monk. It\u2019s a glorious get-together of a show, as warming as the whiskey handed out to the audience \u2013 but you\u2019ll have to pour your own.\n\nKey Change\n\nOpen Clasp is a women\u2019s theatre company aiming to \u201cchange the world, one play at a time\u201d.

In-your-face theatre that stays in your mind.\n\nLe Patin Libre\n\nThink dance on ice and you\u2019d imagine sequins and staggering TV celebrities, but the Canadian troupe, Le Patin Libre, has taken the art form into a new dimension.

Freed from detention centres, liberated from the threat of imminent deportation and no longer obliged to report to the Home Office, many have welcomed the relief. And all this at a time when the general population have learned something of what it is like to live with severe curbs on civil liberties.\n\n\u201cI know it sounds bad to say, but I felt like coronavirus should not go,\u201d says Maimuna Jawo, a Gambian asylum seeker and female genital mutilation campaigner who had to report to the Home Office once a month before March. \u201cMy fear now is that normal life will resume and I\u2019ll have to start reporting again.\u201d\n\nBefore lockdown, Jawo was under orders to report to Eaton House immigration enforcement centre in Hounslow, west London, on the first Wednesday of every month. The preceding nights were always sleepless.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what will happen tomorrow. Maybe they might deport me. Maybe they might put me back in detention,\u201d she says. \u201cYou\u2019re going to face somebody who you know can harm you. It\u2019s like there\u2019s a rope around your neck; every time you go to sign the rope is pulled.\u201d\n\nOn 17 March, Jawo was told that reporting requirements had been lifted because of the pandemic.\n\n\n\nThere has been a similar reprieve for hundreds of people held in detention pending deportation. Latest figures show that numbers have fallen from 1,225 in January to just 368 as of 29 April.\n\n\n\nMelina* fled Malawi after she was raped by a police officer who had arrested her for being bisexual, she said. She was detained at Yarl\u2019s Wood Immigration Removal Centre in March.\n\nOn 24 March her fellow inmates began to be released en masse following news reports of a case of coronavirus at the detention centre. Melina was ecstatic. \u201cI just fell to the floor, putting my hands up, telling the officer, \u2018thank you so much!\u2019. They said: \u2018do you want to stay? Quickly, go and get your things\u2019. So I ran to my room, got my things and left as fast as I could.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe pandemic has left Britain\u2019s \u201chostile environment\u201d policy, of zero-tolerance towards illegal immigration, in limbo. Covid-19 has made it impossible to deport asylum seekers and unsafe to keep them in close confines. NHS workers have received automatic visa extensions.\n\nA Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cAll decisions to detain are made on a case-by-case basis, and in some cases, release on immigration bail may be the most appropriate option.\u201d\n\n\n\nFor some campaigners the current circumstances represent an opportunity. \u201cWhat has happened in a really short space of time with Covid-19 is the undoing of decades of rhetoric that said \u2018we can\u2019t possibly do that\u2019 \u2013 the stopping of reporting, the hundreds of people being released, the extending of visas,\u201d says Karen Doyle, from national organisation Movement for Justice.\n\n'Finally, at last': vulnerable migrants to leave Greece for UK Read more\n\nToufique Hossaini, director of Duncan Lewis Solicitors, agrees: \u201cWell, now it has happened and maybe people can see that this isn\u2019t just possible, it\u2019s actually desirable.\n\n\u201cThe Home Office, for a long time now, has pushed back on the idea of an alternative to detention. This is a turning point: they made their own decision to release people and actually the immigration system didn\u2019t collapse,\u201d he says.\n\nHossaini argues that it would not make sense to invest time and public expense in resurrecting a broken system: \u201cIt would just be a matter of not re-detaining. They\u2019re already out here, they haven\u2019t committed criminal offences, they haven\u2019t disappeared.\u201d\n\n\n\nSome believe that, as the crisis has exposed flaws in the system, this could be a good opportunity to look at the Home Office rule barring those awaiting immigration decisions from working.\n\n\u201cCoronavirus has shown the whole system to be really irrational,\u201d says Hossaini. \u201cWe had to fly in a whole group of Romanian nationals to pick our fruits and vegetables. And yet there are so many of our clients already in the UK eager to work, in both skilled and non-skilled jobs.\u201d\n\n\n\nSince 2012 Maimuna has lived in a 17-bedroom house with 17 adults and nine children provided by the Home Office. No one is permitted to work. Instead, they subsist on a government allowance of \u00a335 each per week.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m thinking, how many people did they put in limbo who could be working on the front line of the NHS right now?\u201d she says. \u201cEverybody here can work and wants to work but we\u2019re not allowed to. We could be cleaners. We could be carers.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Frederick Kkonde , a refugee from Uganda who now works for the NHS. Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The Guardian\n\n\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of talent in the asylum community,\u201d says Frederick Kkonde, who fled torture in Uganda to come to the UK in March 2013. He was granted asylum in July 2015 and is now working in a rehabilitation facility while he pursues a masters in adult nursing.\n\nHe campaigns with Movement for Justice and believes it is both cruel and wasteful not to allow asylum seekers the dignity of contributing to the country they live in. \u201cAll of the asylum seekers I know have something in mind that they want to do. They\u2019d rather make a positive impact.\u201d\n\nHis goal is to become a consultant nurse; he believes that his life experiences only serve to make him better at his job: \u201cI have what it takes to understand what an individual goes through,\u201d he says.\n\n\n\nDoyle explains that many people seeking asylum in the UK are victims of trafficking, torture and sexual violence. The pressures of lockdown can lead to heightened stress, and cause flashbacks.\n\nMelina has been told that she must resume reporting at Eaton House on 4 June. \u201cI don\u2019t feel hopeful,\u201d she says. \u201cI know for sure that means that they\u2019re going to take me again.\u201d\n\n\n\nA Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cFace-to-face reporting requirements will return as soon as practicably possible.\u201d\n\n* Name changed to protect identity\n\n", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/may/25/lockdown-gives-asylum-seekers-reprieve-and-hope-for-change-in-policy", "published": "2020-05-25T00:00:00", "author": ["Clare Considine"]}, {"title": "Broadband services cut off despite the lockdown", "text": "One reader couldn\u2019t cancel a transfer after their house move was put on hold, while another was switched without their consent\n\nTwo months ago I told my broadband provider TalkTalk that I was moving and requested the service be transferred to my new address on 8 May.\n\nSoon after this, lockdown was imposed and the house move, along with everything else, had to be put on hold. I have been working at home since, greatly relying on my broadband. All my subsequent attempts to cancel the switch of the service have failed. Several phone calls went unanswered, while web chats were not available. When I finally thought I had managed to get a message through, the service was disconnected as originally planned.\n\nIt has been very difficult to function.

I think I'm falling in love over Zoom", "text": "I vowed to spend the coronavirus quarantine focused on looking inward. Then I went on one virtual date and everything changed\n\nLying comfortably on her back, Allie looks up into my eyes and graces me with another one of the big smiles that I\u2019ve quickly grown to cherish since matching with her on the dating app Hinge last week. It\u2019s our third date. The first two went exceedingly well, with seamless conversation uncovering like-minded worldviews, agreeable senses of humor, and even some respective vulnerabilities. By this point, as the third-date rule dictates, getting a little randy was natural.\n\n\u201cI was wondering how long it was going to take me to get you into bed,\u201d I say, sparking a laugh, considering our current circumstances.\n\nIndeed, this is the first time I\u2019ve been welcomed into Allie\u2019s bedroom, but this experience has only been made possible thanks to the magic of contemporary video-communication technology.\n\nSuch is courtship in the coronavirus quarantine of 2020.\n\n\u201cYou look so good,\u201d I say into my phone, also in bed, at my apartment in Queens. Allie, whose name has been altered here out of respect for her privacy, thanks me, miles away, from Brooklyn. Earlier this evening, in an attempt at normalcy, we each dined on home-cooked meals \u2013 chicken, rice and steamed broccoli in my case; pasta with Beyond Burger chunks in hers \u2013 while video-chatting on Zoom, dressing up as though we were meeting each other at a restaurant \u2013 I wore a blazer, shirt and tie, while she donned a Creamsicle-inspired spring dress and dangling earrings.\n\nNow, over FaceTime, the conversation turns to sex, and our possible compatibility in that arena. About five minutes in, it becomes apparent we are, in fact, very compatible in that arena.\n\nWe disclose some sexual predilections that, like our political perspectives, are in lockstep.\n\nIt somehow feels as though heat is being exchanged between our screens, almost no different than if we were lying next to each other. When I ask Allie to unbutton the top of her dress \u2013 a wish she grants \u2013 it happens with effortless spontaneity, like all of our other interactions. Driven by the evidence that Allie\u2019s obviously into me, and the fact that we\u2019re only on video chat, an unusual amount of self-confidence flows through me. I can almost play out the prospective, intimate next steps in my mind from muscle memory, the only hindrance being the smartphone in my hand.\n\nI begin to tell her: \u201cI\u2019m so turned on right now.\u201d\n\nPhotograph: Ellen Surrey/Narratively\n\nBut she doesn\u2019t hear the whole sentence. My screen goes black.\n\nFuck. I realize I\u2019ve made the rookie mistake of not charging my phone during a third virtual date \u2013 perhaps the equivalent of forgetting to bring a condom to one \u201cin real life\u201d.\n\nBy the time my battery recovers, the mood is shot, but for the most part I don\u2019t mind. I probably shouldn\u2019t have ventured into that territory to begin with.\n\nI had made a promise to myself that during quarantine I\u2019d do a better job of working on myself, of sitting with my feelings, no matter how sad or worrisome they might become. Across nearly six years of talk therapy \u2013 to treat an anxiety disorder and depression \u2013 I\u2019ve learned that mentally remaining in the present moment, or practicing mindfulness, helps reduce my stress levels. But I\u2019ve also learned just how difficult such an exercise is for me. One of the ways I\u2019ve taken myself out of the moment in the past is through dating, and trying to locate self-worth through the eyes of a woman who\u2019s into me, regardless of my true feelings for her. Staying present during the pandemic would be a great test, and one I believed I could gain much from if I set my mind to it. So, in some ways, I was looking forward to alone time.\n\nThen I started falling for Allie, a woman I have now been dating for a month, but still have not met in person.\n\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\n\nAs the pandemic caught fire in China over the winter, I began breaking bad cycles of behavior. I stopped drinking, redoubled my efforts in therapy, worked out at a gym six days a week, improved my diet, and pulled back on dating to work on myself before opening up to another person. It was part of a larger plan. I have a history of self-soothing my anxiety with booze, food, and, sometimes, women. Emotional chaos is my baseline norm, so I tend to make rash decisions without considering the later consequences to my state of mind. It\u2019s getting drunk to reduce stress, but instead guaranteeing a hangover when I\u2019d planned on a productive work day, which, in turn, increases stress. It\u2019s eating unhealthy comfort foods and then feeling anger at my body when I look in the mirror. It\u2019s climbing into bed with a near stranger, feeling vulnerable with them, and then experiencing inextricable disappointment when a relationship doesn\u2019t bloom.\n\nFortunately, I\u2019ve been able to keep all of this self-sabotage from ever getting completely out of hand. (I\u2019m perhaps somewhere in the middle on the spectrum of addiction.) I make rent in New York City as a full-time freelance writer, generally keep in respectable physical health, and maintain close friendships and relations with my family. I\u2019ve just always felt a little more shitty throughout adulthood than perhaps necessary.\n\nOn Wednesday, 11 March, Tom Hanks announced he\u2019d contracted the coronavirus, the National Basketball Association postponed its games indefinitely, and President Trump suspended most travel from Europe. Though New York was still more than a week away from officially sheltering in place, all of that news was enough to keep me in my apartment, save for excursions to the pharmacy and supermarket and exercise in the form of walks through my neighborhood.\n\nThe panic, for me, would arrive soon. A number of publications I\u2019ve worked closely with on a freelance basis ceased publishing stories from non-staff writers over budget concerns. I worried whether I\u2019d be able to sustain myself financially through the crisis, but, overwhelmed by anxiety, I could barely muster the energy to find new revenue streams. I worked two or three hours a day, if that, in spite of the threat to my financial status.\n\nOne thing was certain, however: I was doing a decent job of staying present. Though at times I really wanted a bourbon, I thankfully didn\u2019t bend. I worked out in my living room and still regularly ate salads for dinner. My therapist, Lori, reminded me that I had savings in place for just such an occasion, and, most importantly, no one close to me was sick or dead from the virus.\n\nI couldn\u2019t believe this was happening. Am I really hitting it off this well with someone right now?\n\nI slowly realized I was in a much better position than many others, and the panic I initially felt subsided.\n\nHowever, old habits die hard. I still hadn\u2019t had a drink, but my exercise routine had all but dissolved. Food delivery emerged as a frequent guilty pleasure, and I reinstalled Hinge on my phone, perhaps a callback to less emotionally sound times.\n\nThen, on Saturday, 28 March, with New York City now the global center of the pandemic, Allie liked my profile.\n\nI\u2019d hit so many dead ends on dating apps that I\u2019d grown weary of the whole matching affair, which, again, calls into question why I was even on the thing. Just looking to mentally check out of the moment? But her big smile compelled me to match back. She\u2019s also an editor and, at 45, a few years older than me, so I presumed she had some mature life experiences behind her, and would be looking for serious prospects only, willing to invest in a relationship \u2013 like I would be if I were technically \u201cdating\u201d.\n\nThe likelihood of a romantic connection seemed slim, if only because there was probably no way I\u2019d be able to see her in person for months. Maybe we could be friends, and forge a new connection that would help us through the pandemic, or perhaps there was a networking opportunity to be had for both of us.\n\nWe only exchanged a couple of texts before I wrote: If you\u2019re comfortable with this, I\u2019d rather not go on and on texting \u2026 I\u2019d prefer to maybe do a low-stakes pandemic phone call or vidchat. How\u2019s that sound?\n\nWhen I\u2019m single, I\u2019m always looking for my partner, my person, and with the video component, I felt the pandemic would be the perfect time to get to know someone without the pressure of sex. I\u2019m not just looking to hook up with people, so if you can get to know someone this way, right now, why not? I also thought that dating, virtually, could be a little bit of a distraction from the pandemic, sure. \u2013 Allie, in an interview on 17 April\n\nFor the first time ever, I scheduled a Zoom meeting, for 7 pm that same night. I felt victorious upon seeing Allie\u2019s face and hearing her voice through my laptop. We spoke for about an hour and 20 minutes, both opening up about how we were dealing with the quarantine. Because this is such a somber moment \u2013 and I think because I truly had zero expectations \u2013 I was at ease discussing my history of anxiety, depression and failed romances, including one marriage. Allie absorbed it all in stride \u2013 even my bare foot, which, unbeknownst to me, repeatedly made appearances in the corner of her screen. She later told me the foot was distracting, but then thought to herself, Well, at least he\u2019s comfortable, so that\u2019s nice!\n\nWhen I asked her if she\u2019d ever been married, she said yes, telling me her husband had died of cancer a few years ago. She disclosed some of the details of his fight, which lasted two years, and the heartbreak she felt over his passing. Sympathy poured out of me, but connecting with someone who\u2019s endured such hard knocks, only to emerge cheerful and optimistic, was both sobering and exciting.\n\nOur second Zoom date, a couple of nights later, lasted about two hours. We chatted about our families and work lives. We weren\u2019t flirty with each other at all \u2013 because, why? \u2013 but after closing my laptop I was struck by a desire to kiss her.\n\nI couldn\u2019t believe this was happening. Am I really hitting it off this well with someone right now?\n\nAfter our titillating third date, Allie and I had another Zoom meeting \u201cfor coffee\u201d that Sunday. We had two more dates that week, including one \u201ctrip to the movies\u201d on Saturday, the 11th, watching Guess Who\u2019s Coming to Dinner on Netflix at the same time, and chatting about it over Zoom afterward. Each of those conversations lasted hours, and we snuck some FaceTime calls in between too. As we talked, we\u2019d catch our faces getting closer together, leaning into the cameras. Before long we were blowing kisses to each other \u2013 though, out of fears that we\u2019d become too emotionally invested, we\u2019ve avoided any attempt at video-chat sex since date three.\n\nAllie seems to get more beautiful every time I talk to her, and the thing I might like most about her is her uncanny ability to sidestep cynical approaches to life and instead travel an upbeat high road, looking at every little thing with a bright perspective, like with the onscreen foot incident \u2013 a yin to my yang. We\u2019ve independently told our families and some friends about each other, exercising cautious optimism in framing the relationship. So far, everyone\u2019s been open-minded, supportive and happy for us.\n\nAt the end of one impromptu FaceTime, on 10 April, I started fishing for hints on how strongly she felt about me. (This can\u2019t be \u201creal,\u201d right?) Work had started to pick up for me, and I had to hang up to get some stuff done, but something inside me was pushing to stay on the call with her. Resigning to finally x-out of our talk, I said, \u201cMaybe let me know you miss me later, if that\u2019s a thing that happens for you \u2026 ?\u201d\n\nShe laughed and said, \u201cSure.\u201d\n\nA few minutes later, she texted \u201cI miss you!\ud83d\ude43\u201d I took the emoji as verification that, yes, she too was a bit puzzled by the fact that this budding relationship could somehow feel so special.\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d I texted back. \u201cI miss you all the time. WHAT IS THIS!?! Lol.\u201d\n\n\u201cHaha. Awww \ud83e\udd70,\u201d she wrote back.\n\nI thrive in relationships where my partner is forthcoming. When I\u2019m with someone and they\u2019re open, it\u2019s better to know what\u2019s going on so it can be addressed than to have them hide their feelings, even if they\u2019re not the most savory of emotions or thoughts. When I think about, \u2018How did this get so deep, so quickly?\u2019 that\u2019s a big part of it. \u2013 Allie\n\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\n\nOver the course of our conversations, Allie and I openly wondered if we were only bonding as eagerly as we were to avoid confronting our fears of the global-crisis reality. I was particularly concerned because of my mental health history, and I began thinking this could be another instance where I was engaging in relatively self-destructive behavior.\n\nBut Allie wasn\u2019t deterred by her worried feelings or mine.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve already been through the worst thing that could happen to a person in a relationship,\u201d she once said, referencing the death of her husband. \u201cIf this doesn\u2019t work out \u2013 even if we never see each other in person, or if we do and we realize this isn\u2019t really viable \u2013 I\u2019ll get through it, and just try and meet someone else.\u201d\n\nWhat emotional strife am I subjecting myself to by buying into a relationship crafted in such an odd, unprecedented stretch in my life and the world?\n\nIn my core, I feel the same way. I have gotten through a divorce, and another breakup with a woman I lived with for nearly two years. Still, what emotional strife am I subjecting myself to by buying into a relationship crafted in such an odd, unprecedented stretch in my life and the world?\n\nI eventually spoke about Allie with Lori, my therapist, over Skype.\n\n\u201cSo I\u2019m \u2018seeing\u2019 someone,\u201d I told her, nervously and with air quotes.\n\nTherapy is the one place where I always feel safe. Lori and I have built trust over the course of years, and as a result I\u2019m able to remain more present in her company, and tap deeply into my emotions. Talking to Lori that day, I was worried I might reveal to myself that I wasn\u2019t on as strong an emotional footing in this new relationship as I\u2019d hoped.\n\nBut that didn\u2019t happen.\n\nLori said she thought Allie sounded \u201clovely\u201d, though she did advise me to proceed \u2013 as in any other situation of such gravity \u2013 with mindfulness, and an awareness that meeting Allie in person could change things between her and me quickly.\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d I said, unsure if my heart was synchronized with my mind.\n\nBy Saturday, 11 April, two weeks after my first video-chat with Allie, we set a date: 18 April would be our first in-person meeting, at her place, where she lives alone. The topic, like everything else between us, just came up organically. I\u2019m not sure who mentioned it first, but it was clear that we both wanted to be together, in the flesh. There have been many moments where, when we\u2019ve held our respective cameras close up to ourselves, we felt like we could literally reach out and touch each other. But that wasn\u2019t enough. Person-to-person contact was fast becoming a must.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll take an Uber to your place,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ll wash my hands as soon as I get inside too.\u201d\n\n\u201cMake sure you wear a mask and some gloves, please,\u201d she added.\n\nThe fact that she was opening her home up to me, of all people, under these circumstances was, in a strange way, incredibly romantic.\n\nStanding in my kitchen later that Saturday afternoon, I talked with my roommate, Steve (a pseudonym), checking in on how each of us was getting along in quarantine. I mentioned without much thought that I was planning on seeing Allie in person, at her apartment, the following Saturday.\n\n\u201cI gotta say, the thought of you going over there gives me a little anxiety,\u201d Steve said. \u201cIt\u2019s a risk, to you but also to me.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, sure,\u201d I said, \u201cbut I\u2019m going to be very careful. I\u2019ll take an Uber there, and back. I\u2019ll wear a mask and gloves during the rides, wash my hands right away, all that stuff.\u201d\n\nHe was appreciative, but presumed \u2013 correctly \u2013 that I wouldn\u2019t go all the way to Allie\u2019s place to sit six feet away from her the whole time.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure she\u2019s been careful and that she\u2019s trustworthy, but you never really know, do you?\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI guess, but if I really thought the risk to your health was significant, I wouldn\u2019t go,\u201d I said. \u201cIf you want to tell me not to go, that\u2019s fine. I don\u2019t want you to be resentful.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re an adult,\u201d he responded. \u201cI\u2019m not going to tell you what you can and can\u2019t do; I\u2019m just saying if you see her, it\u2019s going to be something that I\u2019ll worry about for a while afterward.\u201d\n\nIs this another instance where I\u2019m bent on making a rash decision, with consequences I\u2019m not considering?\n\nHe then said something that hit hard: \u201cI have a friend who lives just a few blocks away, and I\u2019d love to go hang out with them, but I\u2019m not because they could get me sick and then I can get you sick.\u201d\n\nIs this another instance where I\u2019m bent on making a rash decision, with consequences I\u2019m not considering?\n\nIt wasn\u2019t long ago in therapy that Lori reminded me of life\u2019s \u201cgolden rule\u201d, which is to \u201ctreat others as you would like to be treated\u201d. Of course, I\u2019d heard that phrase since probably before kindergarten, but it had begun to resonate with me more strongly in our session that particular day, just prior to the quarantine. To live by such a code is not only humbling but also a way to slow down your mind, consider another\u2019s feelings, and stay present.\n\nThe secret life of an anonymous speechwriter to the stars Read more\n\nAfter hearing Steve out, I took the time to truly deliberate over the right course of action. I decided to wait to see Allie, but as I committed my mind to calling off our first in-person date, I felt crushed by sadness. When I talked to Lori about the episode, she applauded my responsible decision, and we called attention to the fact that if I\u2019d gone to see Allie, I might have had a wonderful time with her, but I\u2019d have added more worries to my plate, about getting sick and getting others sick in the aftermath.\n\nAllie completely understood \u2013 just like her.\n\n\u201cI wish it could happen, but I totally get why it can\u2019t right now,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re not the one who lives alone, so you have to be sensitive to your roommate.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s only a matter of time before the shelter-in-place guidelines are eased in New York, and we can hang out together, at her place, talking for hours, eating lunch and dinner, watching a movie, and making out, at the very least. Only then might I get over the fear that she won\u2019t be attracted to me in person. As I write this, our governor is happily reporting that the number of statewide daily coronavirus hospitalizations is decreasing, and his administration is already in the planning stages of a \u201creopening\u201d.\n\nWhen I discuss the idea of writing this piece with Allie, I tell her that I\u2019ll pitch something with a title like \u201cfalling in love in the time of coronavirus\u201d.\n\n\u201cDo you think that would be an appropriate way to frame this?\u201d I ask her, my voice trembling with nerves, fishing again for insight into her feelings for me.\n\n\u201cYeah, I would say so,\u201d she responds, and a sense of relief washes over me. \u201cIn fact I just wrote in my journal the other day that I think we\u2019re falling for each other.\u201d\n\nAside from that offhand mention, we\u2019re not officially dropping the L-word yet. I think we both know that would be too absurd at this point. All we can do is continue to get to know each other, safely, over Zoom.\n\nWhich is still pretty great.\n\nWhen it\u2019s the right person, it doesn\u2019t matter how it all starts.

It also includes the number of patients currently in intensive care, or requiring ventilators.\n\nSource of infections\n\nThis chart shows the daily new case count by the source of infection to compare overseas v local cases. It\u2019s important to also note that a large number of cases are under investigation at any point in time, and so these figures can change retrospectively with further updates.\n\nMaps of confirmed cases in four states\n\n\n\nOnly four states are currently reporting cases by location \u2013 NSW, Victoria, Queensland and Western Australia.\n\nHere\u2019s the geographic distribution of cases within New South Wales.

If confirmed, this is a worryingly high rate which raises the prospect of many infected individuals, possibly without symptoms, being passed fit to return to healthcare settings where they will transmit SARS-CoV-2 to colleagues and patients.\u201d\n\nUp to 20% of hospital patients with Covid-19 caught it at hospital Read more\n\nDoctors feel \u201cdeep concern and frustration\u201d at PHE\u2019s \u201csystematic lack of information\u201d about the different types of coronavirus tests and say a \u201cwall of silence seems to have been erected around the issue\u201d.\n\nThe HCSA is also angry that the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) has refused to fully answer parliamentary questions which Labour has tabled to find out more about the tests.\n\nJustin Madders, a shadow health minister, asked the DHSC what recent estimate it had made of the false-negative rate of each of the Covid-19 tests in use. In reply Nadine Dorries, the health minister, said only that \u201cviral detection tests have high levels of clinical sensitivity at close to 100%\u201d. The staff of NHS laboratories do everything they can to minimise false positives, she said.\n\nAsked by Madders to name all the Covid-19 tests in use, Dorries declined to do so. She simply replied: \u201cThere are eight key testing platforms which deliver the majority of testing. All these tests are clinically validated and have high levels of performance.\u201d\n\nNor would Dorries tell Madders which tests for Covid-19 the NHS had stopped using and why. Instead she reiterated that eight clinically validated tests were being used.\n\nRecent research published in the British Medical Journal found that between 2% and 29% of Covid-19 tests produced false negatives. The number of \u201ctrue positive\u201d results from nasal swabs was as low as 63% and from throat swabs just 32%, the lead author, Dr Jessica Watson, reported.\n\nProf Andrew Goddard, president of the Royal College of Physicians, said: \u201cThe main issue from the perspective of physicians has been, until recently, the lack of access to testing as shown by our survey. Even though the test is far from perfect the inability for healthcare and social care workers to access the test for themselves, their patients and their families has hampered our ability to respond to the pandemic and control its spread within hospitals and care homes.\u201d\n\nDr Nick Phin, PHE\u2019s incident director, declined to respond directly to the HCSA\u2019s concerns. He said: \u201cThe UK\u2019s national testing system is built on strong foundations using the latest scientific evidence and expert advice. The different tests in use have been assessed as performing to manufacturers\u2019 specifications.\u201d", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/25/doctors-condemn-secrecy-over-false-negative-covid-19-tests", "published": "2020-05-25T00:00:00", "author": ["Denis Campbell"]}, {"title": "Jair Bolsonaro branded a 'killer' during hot dog trip as Covid-19 death toll soars", "text": "Brazilian president subject to public anger after stepping out in Brasilia on fast food errand\n\nThe Brazilian president, Jair Bolsonaro, was branded a \u201ckiller\u201d by his opponents as he popped out for a Saturday night hot dog on the day a further 965 of his citizens were reported to have died from Covid-19.\n\nBolsonaro, a rightwing populist who basks in comparisons to Donald Trump, has repeatedly flouted health ministry physical distancing guidelines \u2013 and continued to do so this weekend, even as Brazil\u2019s coronavirus death toll rose to over 22,000.\n\nMore than 347,000 infections have been confirmed in Brazil \u2013 the second highest number in the world after the US.\n\nAccording to local media reports, Bolsonaro went out on to the streets of the capital, Bras\u00edlia, on Saturday for a can of coke and a hot dog.\n\nPolls suggest Bolsonaro still enjoys the backing of a third of Brazilians \u2013 and some local supporters celebrated Bolsonaro\u2019s outing by shouting his nickname \u201cMito\u201d (legend).

The pharmaceutical companies on the IMI, however, did not take up the idea.\n\nUK scientists want to infect volunteers with Covid-19 in race to find vaccine Read more\n\nThe revelation is contained in a report published by the Corporate Observatory Europe (COE), a Brussels-based research centre, examining decisions made by the IMI, which has a budget of \u20ac5bn (\u00a34.5bn), made up of EU funding and in-kind contributions from private and other bodies.\n\nThe IMI\u2019s governing board is made up of commission officials and representatives of the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries (EFPIA), whose members include some of the biggest names in the sector, among them GlaxoSmithKline, Novartis, Pfizer, Lilly and Johnson & Johnson.\n\nA global lack of preparedness for the coronavirus pandemic has already led to accusations in recent weeks that the pharmaceutical industry has failed to prioritise treatments for infectious diseases because they are less profitable than chronic medical conditions.\n\nThe world\u2019s 20 largest pharmaceutical companies undertook around 400 new research projects in the past year, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. Around half were focused on treating cancer, compared with 65 on infectious diseases.\n\nThere are eight potential vaccines for coronavirus in clinical trials, but there is no guarantee of success. One of the most promising, being developed at Oxford University, is said to have only a 50% chance of being approved for use.\n\nThe COE report says that rather than \u201ccompensating for market failures\u201d by speeding up the development of innovative medicines, as per its remit, the IMI has been \u201cmore about business-as-usual market priorities\u201d.\n\nThe report\u2019s authors cite a comment posted on the IMI\u2019s website, since removed, selling the advantages of the initiative to big pharma as offering \u201ctremendous cost savings, as the IMI projects replicate work that individual companies would have had to do anyway\u201d.\n\nThe European commission\u2019s \u201cbiopreparedness\u201d funding proposal in 2017 would have involved refining computer simulations, known as in silico modelling, and improved analysis of animal testing models to give regulators greater confidence in approving vaccines.\n\nThe hunt for a coronavirus vaccine \u2013 podcast Read more\n\nMinutes of a meeting of the IMI\u2019s governing board from December 2018 reveal that the proposal was not accepted. The IMI also decided against funding projects with the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, a foundation seeking to tackle so-called blueprint priority diseases such as Mers and Sars, both of them coronaviruses.\n\n\u201cWhile the scope of a regulatory topic as proposed by the commission was not supported by EFPIA industries, the theme of regulatory modernisation is considered very important by industries, and will be further discussed,\u201d the minutes record. \u201cInteraction with the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) continues but no immediate co-investment is expected.\u201d\n\nIn response to the report, a spokeswoman for the IMI said infectious diseases and vaccines had been a priority from the outset. She highlighted a \u20ac20m project known as Zapi launched in 2015 following the Ebola pandemic and which focuses on biopreparedness.\n\nThe IMI launched funding for \u201cinnovations to accelerate vaccine development and manufacture\u201d in January.\n\nThe spokeswoman said the topic had been competing with other priorities at the time of the 2017 proposal, including research into tuberculosis, auto-immune diseases and digital health.\n\nWhy we might not get a coronavirus vaccine Read more\n\n\u201cThe report seems to suggest the IMI has failed in its mission to protect the European citizen by letting pass an opportunity to prepare society for the current Covid pandemic,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThis is misleading in two ways: the research proposed by the EC in the biopreparedness topic was small in scope, and focused on revisiting animal models and developing in silico models to better define/anticipate the type and level of immune response elicited in animals and humans in order to increase regulators\u2019 confidence in the evidence base for alternative licensing procedures.\n\n\u201cIMI\u2019s projects have contributed, directly or indirectly, to better prepare the research community for the current crisis, eg the Ebola+ programme or the Zapi project.\u201d\n\nThe COE report says the directing influence of big pharma on the IMI\u2019s research agenda has led it to becoming dominated by industry priorities, and sidelining poverty-related and neglected diseases, including coronaviruses.\n\nThe thinktank points to official evaluations that found the IMI had enabled competing global companies to work together with small and medium-sized businesses and academia, but that it was difficult to identify positive socioeconomic outcomes.\n\nThe most recent evaluation in 2017 questioned whether the European pharmaceutical industry should continue to be the \u201cmain driver\u201d on the future of medicine.\n\nThe COE also says that as a result of the industry\u2019s domination of the IMI, there are significant gaps in funding for diseases pinpointed by the World Health Organization (WHO) Report on Priority Medicines for Europe and the World as of public health importance, for which pharmaceutical treatments either do not exist or are inadequate.\n\nSeven of the 25 priority areas the WHO identified have no IMI projects, including neonatal conditions and postpartum haemorrhage, according to the report.\n\nSeventeen IMI projects relate to Alzheimer\u2019s disease, 12 to diabetes and 10 to cancer. As important as these diseases are, there is no lack of wider interest in providing treatments, leading the report to question whether EU money has been appropriately spent.\n\n\u201cClearly, these disease areas are not suffering from a market failure, as the global pharmaceutical industry is investing heavily in them already, which is not surprising, given the large market potential for new treatments,\u201d the CEO writes.\n\nAn IMI spokeswoman said that about a third of the IMI budget was spent on infectious diseases, including antimicrobial resistance, vaccines, Ebola and tuberculosis, and that other funds went on cross-cutting issues in drug development.", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/25/exclusive-big-pharma-rejected-eu-plan-to-fast-track-vaccines-in-2017", "published": "2020-05-25T00:00:00", "author": ["Daniel Boffey"]}, {"title": "Monday briefing: Johnson caught in Cummings turmoil", "text": "Top story: Cummings could face police investigation\n\nMorning everyone.

The prime minister tried to quell the mounting storm triggered by the Guardian\u2019s story on Saturday by saying yesterday that Cummings had acted with \u201cintegrity\u201d. But with government scientific advisers expressing dismay at the aide\u2019s flouting of the rules and nine Tory MPs calling for Cummings\u2019s head, Johnson has not silenced the critics.

Find out what the papers have to say here, including our columnist Martin Kettle, who savages Johnson\u2019s response, calling it a \u201cself-centred, self-indulgent signal to the public that the rules no longer really matter\u201d.\n\nAt an unscheduled press conference appearance on Sunday, Johnson said some aspects of the story about Cummings were \u201cpalpably false\u201d, but he did not say which and ignored some direct questions. Cummings is facing a possible police investigation after a witness complained to police that he saw Cummings in Durham in a second breach of lockdown in April.

PM and Cummings should do likewise.\u201d\n\nJohnson\u2019s unexpected appearance at the press briefing on Sunday \u2013 his first in nearly two weeks - was seen by his own MPs as an attempt to protect Cummings following revelations that the adviser had broken the lockdown rules he had helped to write.\n\nJohnson did not respond to a series of detailed questions including whether Cummings stopped during the four-hour journey and whether the prime minister had known of Cummings\u2019s trip at the time.\n\nSenior Tory MPs said that the prime minister\u2019s decision to attend the press conference and his inability to answer detailed questions will fuel the furore and will damage his premiership. \u201cThe PM is losing his instinct, he might be losing the plot and we could lose the country over this virus,\u201d said one.\n\nReacting to the prime minister\u2019s comments, Sir Roger Gale MP said it was an \u201cextraordinary position\u201d for Johnson to take. \u201cIt\u2019s up to the prime minister to exercise judgment about who he has around him,\u201d he told BBC Radio 5 Live.\n\nTim Montgomerie, a former Johnson adviser, tweeted: \u201cTonight, I\u2019m really embarrassed to have ever backed Boris Johnson for high office.\u201d\n\nPlay Video 1:23 Boris Johnson: Dominic Cummings followed 'instincts of every father' in lockdown \u2013 video\n\nMPs including the former minister and 1922 Committee member, Steve Baker, and the chair of the Northern Ireland select committee, Simon Hoare, said Cummings should step aside to stop further damage to the government.\n\nHoare said: \u201cWith the damage Mr Cummings is doing to the government\u2019s reputation, he must consider his position. Lockdown has had its challenges for everyone.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s his cavalier \u2018I don\u2019t care; I\u2019m cleverer than you\u2019 tone that infuriates people. He is now wounding the PM/Govt & I don\u2019t like that.\u201d\n\nAnger and dismay was also expressed by Church of England bishops on Twitter after the prime minister\u2019s press conference. The Rt Revd Nick Baines, bishop of Leeds, said: \u201cThe question now is: do we accept being lied to, patronised and treated by a PM as mugs? The moral question is not for Cummings - it is for PM and ministers/MPs who find this behaviour acceptable.\n\n\u201cWhat are we to teach our children? (I ask as a responsible father.)\u201d\n\nA few minutes earlier, the Rt Revd Dr Helen-Ann Hartley, bishop of Ripon, wrote: \u201cIntegrity, trust and leadership were never there; just a driven misguided ideology of power that has total disregard for the most weak and vulnerable, and those who work to protect and care for us with relatively low pay.\u201d\n\nFollowing the press conference, Starmer said: \u201cThis was a test of the prime minister and he has failed it. It is an insult to sacrifices made by the British people that Boris Johnson has chosen to take no action against Dominic Cummings. The public will be forgiven for thinking there is one rule for the prime minister\u2019s closest adviser and another for the British people.\n\n\u201cThe prime minister\u2019s actions have undermined confidence in his own public health message at this crucial time. Millions were watching for answers and they got nothing. That\u2019s why the cabinet secretary must now launch an urgent inquiry.\u201d\n\nLeaving Downing Street after about six hours in No 10 on Sunday, Cummings refused to answer questions. Earlier, police officers had visited his north London home in response to media gathering outside.\n\nA jogger reported that he saw Cummings on 19 April, five days after Downing Street says he returned to London from Durham and did not return.\n\nMinisters had denied reports in the Guardian and Daily Mirror that Cummings was seen looking at bluebells in woods near Houghall, close to his family\u2019s property on the outskirts of Durham, that day.\n\nOur source stood by their claim and Tim Matthews, a runner, has since come forward to claim he saw Cummings later that day. Matthews tweeted a link to a route from the running app Strava that he had dubbed \u201cBrick Run aka Dominic Cummings Spotting Run\u201d.\n\nIt marks the area where he saw Cummings at 3.45pm on 19 April. He tweeted: \u201cHere\u2019s my two potential sightings Riverbanks and Houghall Woods \u2013 I\u2019ve been banging on about them ever since.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Dominic Cummings leaves 10 Downing Street. Photograph: Chris J Ratcliffe/Getty Images\n\nMeanwhile Cummings is facing a possible police investigation under health laws over a claim that he breached self-isolation rules by allegedly visiting Barnard Castle on 12 April. Lees made a complaint by email to police on Sunday after reporting that he saw Cummings and his family walking in the town before getting into a car.\n\nThe alleged sighting of Cummings in the town appeared to come while he was still ill, according to his own account. Writing in the Spectator last month, Cummings said: \u201cAt the end of March and for the first two weeks of April I was ill, so we [Cummings and his wife] were both shut in together.\u201d\n\nJohnson did not dispute that his adviser had made a trip to the Tees Valley beauty spot. Asked directly about the visit, the prime minister said: \u201cWhen you look at the guidance, when you look at the particular childcare needs that Mr Cummings faced at the time, it was reasonable of him to self-isolate as he did for 14 days or more with his family where he did. I think that was sensible and defensible and I understand it.\u201d\n\nDurham police has yet to respond to complaint but the Guardian understands the force is considering whether it needs to take any further action in relation to Cummings.\n\nAs well as Lees\u2019 complaint, the leader of the Liberal Democrats group on Durham County Council has demanded the police open an investigation into whether Cummings broke the 2020 Health Protection (Coronavirus) Regulations.", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/24/boris-johnson-defence-dominic-cummings-anger-from-allies-and-opponents-alike", "published": "2020-05-24T00:00:00", "author": ["Rajeev Syal", "Matthew Weaver", "Peter Walker"]}, {"title": "Defending Cummings: questions answered - and skirted over", "text": "Boris Johnson resolutely defended Dominic Cummings when the furore over him forced an unscheduled appearance at the coronavirus press briefing on Sunday.\n\nBut while the prime minister, speaking at the daily Downing Street conference, said he thought that Cummings had acted \u201cresponsibly, legally and with integrity\u201d, he left many questions unanswered, skirted around key issues and provoked fresh fury among Tory MPs and political opponents alike.\n\nBoris Johnson backs Dominic Cummings in face of Tory calls for chief aide to resign Read more\n\nJohnson insisted Cummings had not broken any guidelines by travelling to Durham for childcare reasons\n\nMr Cummings did isolate for 14 days or more and the circumstances of his self-isolation were determined by the difficult childcare position that he found himself in ... the guidance makes it very clear that where you have particular childcare needs that has got to be taken into account.\n\nJohnson did not make clear which guidance he was referring to. Cummings\u2019 home is in London, and the government rules at the time were specific \u2013 stay at home.\n\nThe prime minister himself had implored people not to travel and visit relatives. Cabinet Office advice was also emphatic: \u201cLeaving your home \u2013 the place you live \u2013 to stay at another home for a holiday or other purpose is not allowed. This includes visiting second homes.\u201d\n\nAsked by reporters on Saturday for her reading of the exemptions in the coronavirus guidelines, the deputy chief medical officer for England, Jenny Harries, suggested that an exemption would be \u201cunless there is an extreme risk to life\u201d. Nobody has suggested this was the case with Cummings and his family.\n\nJohnson did not explain how Cummings got to Durham in the first place. Was it by car? If so, did he stop on the way? By train? If so, was he with other passengers? Nor was there any detailed explanation for why the couple\u2019s childcare needs could only be catered for with a 260-mile trip to Durham, rather than in London.\n\nJohnson said some of the allegations made against Cummings were false and that he had acted to stop the spread of the virus\n\nThough there have been many other allegations about what happened when he was in self-isolation and thereafter, some of them palpably false, I believe that in every respect he has acted responsibly and legally and with integrity and with the overwhelming aim of stopping the spread of the virus and saving lives.\n\nAgain, Johnson did not specify which of the allegations he regarded as \u201cpalpably false\u201d. But when he was asked a direct question about whether Cummings had taken a trip to Barnard Castle during his stay in Durham, Johnson ignored the question, and said that what Cummings had done more generally was \u201csensible and defensible\u201d. He said Cummings had been in self isolation for \u201c14 days or more\u201d and had behaved responsibly.\n\nOne law for Dominic Cummings, another for the rest of us | Letters Read more\n\nBut if Cummings did go to Barnard Castle on 12 April, as the Guardian reported, that would seem to be a very clear and obvious breach of the lockdown guidelines, whether or not his 14-day period of isolation was at an end.\n\nBarnard Castle is close to 30 miles from the house where Cummings was staying. It is exactly the kind of day trip that ministers, in briefing after briefing, have urged millions of people not to make but to \u201cstay at home, protect the NHS, save lives\u201d.\n\nJohnson said Cummings had behaved as any parent would have done, and denied it was one rule for some and another rule for others\n\nIs this government asking you \u2013 the people, the public \u2013 to do one thing, while senior people here in government do something else?\u2026 I think he followed the instincts of every father and every parent. And I do not mark him down for that.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe PM\u2019s defence of Cummings\u2019s paternal instincts begged an obvious question that he did not answer.\n\nDo instincts come before rules and guidelines? As the Tory MP, David Warburton, tweeted shortly after the briefing: \u201cWe\u2019ve all been tasked with tempering our parental, and other, instincts by strictly adhering to govt guidance.\u201d\n\nTim Montgomerie, creator of the ConservativeHome website, went further. \u201cIn a pandemic the messages the government puts out have to respected. And if you have a key adviser flouting those rules and no apology, that is a terrible failure on the part of government. That is a terrible undermining of government communications. We have come to realise how reliant Boris Johnson is on Dominic Cummings as an adviser. I\u2019m afraid he has chosen to stick with him. If Johnson loses Cummings, he risks losing the whole operation he has surrounded himself with.\u201d\n\nIn a tweet, the Labour MP Jess Phillips said: \u201cThe instincts of most other fathers in the country was to look after their partner and children at home.\u201d", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/24/defending-cummings-questions-answered-and-skirted-over", "published": "2020-05-24T00:00:00", "author": ["Nick Hopkins", "Peter Walker"]}, {"title": "Coronavirus: Trump aide claims China guilty of cover-up akin to Chernobyl", "text": "The White House on Sunday accused China of a cover-up that will \u201cgo down in history along with Chernobyl\u201d, ramping up efforts to deflect attention from a Covid-19 death toll in the US fast closing on 100,000.\n\nThe US doctors taking Trump\u2019s lead on hydroxychloroquine \u2013 despite mixed results Read more\n\nRobert O\u2019Brien, Donald Trump\u2019s national security adviser, made the claim on two political talk shows, saying Beijing gave \u201cfalse information\u201d to the World Health Organization (WHO) at the start of the year and alleging that stonewalling of an investigation into the origins of the pandemic has cost \u201cmany, many thousands of lives in America and around the world\u201d.\n\nOn Saturday Mike Pence, the vice-president, told Breitbart News that China had \u201clet the world down\u201d and insisted the WHO was \u201ctheir willing partner in withholding from the US and wider world vital information about the coronavirus\u201d.\n\nThe Trump administration has become increasingly keen to move attention away from its handling of the pandemic, which has seen more deaths in the US than any other nation and a broken economy including soaring unemployment that another senior adviser told CNN would still be \u201cin double digits\u201d by the 3 November presidential election.\n\nO\u2019Brien dampened speculation that the administration might seek to delay that election.

There was a cover up that someday they\u2019re going to do an HBO show like they did with Chernobyl,\u201d he added, likening the pandemic to the 1986 nuclear disaster in Ukraine which Soviet authorities initially tried to hide.\n\nO\u2019Brien repeated the claim on NBC\u2019s Meet the Press, accusing China of a \u201ccover-up that \u2026 is going to go down in history along with Chernobyl\u201d.\n\nMost scientists say the pathogen that has infected 5.3 million people and killed more than 342,000 worldwide, according to Johns Hopkins University, was passed from bats to humans via an intermediary species probably sold at a wet market in Wuhan, China, last year.\n\nBut Trump, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and other senior US figures have repeatedly said they suspect the coronavirus was somehow released from the Wuhan Institute of Virology, a claim China has strenuously denied.\n\nO\u2019Brien claimed China\u2019s alleged skulduggery was continuing.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a chance, and it\u2019s been reported, that the Chinese have been engaged in espionage to try and find the research and the technologies that we\u2019re working on both for a vaccine and a therapy,\u201d he told CBS.\n\n\u201cSo look, they\u2019ve got a many, many year history of stealing American intellectual property and knocking off American technology.

He duly went back to Trump National in Sterling.\n\nOn Twitter the president, who criticized Barack Obama in 2014 for golfing when a second case of Ebola was confirmed in the US, preferred to concentrate on topics other than the pandemic.\n\nTrump feuded with his former attorney general, Jeff Sessions; attacked Joe Biden, his likely opponent in November; retweeted abusive messages about female opponents; repeated unsubstantiated allegations that mail-in ballots lead to rigged elections; and repeated baseless insinuations that an MSNBC host might have murdered an aide.\n\nHe also tweeted falsely that coronavirus \u201ccases, numbers and deaths are going down all over the Country!\u201d\n\nOn Saturday, North Carolina reported its highest one-day spike in cases.

On Tuesday, it closed and reopened its Chicago Assembly plant twice in less than 24 hours, after two workers tested positive for Covid-19. On Wednesday, Ford temporarily shut its Dearborn, Michigan truck plant after an employee tested positive, then promptly resumed operations.\n\nSo why \u201creopen\u201d so abruptly, when Covid-19 continues to claim lives?\n\nThe main reason given is to get the economy moving again. But this begs the question of why an economy exists in the first place, other than to promote the wellbeing of people within it.\n\nBoth Ford plants are vital to the company\u2019s profitability, and that profitability is important to jobs in the midwest. But surely the wellbeing of Ford workers, their families, the people of Chicago and Dearborn and others are more important.\n\nA related argument is that workers are clamoring to return to their jobs. \u201cPeople want to get back to work,\u201d Trump has asserted repeatedly. Fox News host Sean Hannity claims people are \u201cdying to get back to work\u201d, seemingly unaware of the irony of his words.\n\nPolls suggest otherwise.

Rich economies can support their people for years if necessary. During the second world war, America shut down most of its economy for nearly four years.\n\nThe obstacle right now is a lack of political will to provide such support, at least until testing and tracing provide reasonable assurance the pandemic is contained.\n\nAlthough nearly half of all US households report lost employment income since mid-March, extra jobless benefits enacted by Congress are only starting to trickle out now. Trump and the Republican Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, refuse to extend them beyond 31 July.\n\nMeanwhile, states are denying benefits to anyone whose company has called them back.\n\nFinally, Trump and his enablers argue that reopening is a matter of \u201cfreedom\u201d.

But we can't waste time on blame", "text": "In 1981, a virus that had jumped the species barrier some decades earlier to infect humans began to wreak havoc among the gay community in San Francisco and New York. A taskforce was set up to study the cause of this disease, and it took a few years to identify HIV as the definitive cause of Aids and its genome to be sequenced, and nearly 15 years before a cocktail of drugs meant that having an HIV infection was no longer a certain death sentence.\n\nForty years later, the cause of the Covid-19 outbreak in Wuhan was identified as a new coronavirus Sars-CoV-2, and its sequence determined in a matter of weeks. That, in turn, paved the way for a sensitive test for infection and, now, antibody tests for people who may have had the disease. That we know so much in such record time is due to sustained international investment in science.\n\nHowever, there is much that we don\u2019t know. We do not know why this virus is so much more transmissible than some others. Whether being infected will make us immune and, if so, for how long. Why it sometimes sets off a severe inflammatory reaction that can lead to death, and why some individuals are more vulnerable to it than others.\n\nScience is also helping to drive the unprecedented worldwide search for a vaccine, but it is the stark reality that, even after 40 years, there is no vaccine for Aids or many other viral diseases. So it is important to put strong efforts into new and repurposed drugs to combat infection.\n\nScientists must be frank about admitting the inevitable mistakes as evidence emerges, and be willing to learn from them\n\nSuch uncertainty is intrinsic to science. Normally, a gradual accumulation of evidence and scrutiny by the community means that mistakes get weeded out and a consensus emerges. That system works well normally, but science is now under the full glare of the public spotlight and under pressure to provide quick answers. In these circumstances, scientists must make clear the uncertainties in their evidence. They must acknowledge that, when faced with such uncertainties, different scientists may reach different conclusions about the likelihood of various possibilities, which will affect their advice. As new evidence emerges, they must be frank about admitting the inevitable mistakes, and be willing to learn from them. They must try to avoid the groupthink that is common to all enterprises and make sure that internal debate is robust. And they must be open about their evidence and conclusions, so that they can be scrutinised. However, it is not possible for scientists to give frank advice if they feel that they will be made the scapegoats for difficult policy decisions.\n\nMoreover, translating science advice into policy can lead to very different paths, as can be seen from the divergent responses to Covid-19 across the world. This is because the science advice is only one factor in policymaking. Governments not only have to contend with the uncertainty of the science but a host of other practical considerations, including feasibility. In all this, they may want certainty from scientists \u2013 and feel or claim that they are \u201cfollowing the science\u201d \u2013 but wishing something does not make it so.\n\nNo 10 facing fresh calls for transparency over Sage pandemic advice Read more\n\nThe most important thing in the middle of a crisis is to constantly review what we are doing against the evidence. If we find we have followed a wrong path, we cannot waste precious time squabbling and apportioning blame. In particular, blaming scientists for their advice in an uncertain situation betrays a fundamental misunderstanding of how science works. It was therefore reassuring to see, last week, No 10 distancing itself from an effort by a minister to blame scientists for their advice.\n\nInstead, when new evidence suggests that we should do something differently or better, both the government and scientists need to acknowledge this, explain why we need to change policy, and change tack accordingly. I think the public will understand that what may, in retrospect, appear to have been poor decisions were made with the best intentions based on what was known at the time \u2013 as long as they are recognised and corrected as soon as possible.\n\nAlthough a viral pandemic was known to be our top threat and the UK thought it was well prepared for one, clearly we were not.

While millions across the world were told to remain at home to stay safe from the coronavirus pandemic, he and his neighbours were forced to flee.\n\nThat night in March, he recalls, residents from Tin Ma village, in Rakhine state, clambered anxiously into boats, crossed the river, then trekked through foothills to seek refuge in the relative safety of a nearby town. No one switched on a torch or even lit a cigarette for fear of drawing the attention of Myanmar\u2019s army.\n\nIt is less than three years since the Myanmar military\u2019s violent crackdown on Rohingya Muslim communities in Rakhine state, a campaign of violence that has since led to a genocide case in the UN\u2019s highest court.\n\nNow the army is once again accused of committing war crimes against its own people. The tactics are familiar, but the primary targets this time are Rakhine Buddhists such as Kyaw Thu, as well as Rohingya, Mro, Daignet and Chin communities.\n\nDespite sharing a faith with Myanmar\u2019s rulers, Rakhine Buddhists have long complained of persecution, and say the development of their state has been stifled by the central government. Repression has now, they say, escalated into violent atrocities.\n\nFor more than a year, a long-simmering conflict has escalated between the military and the Arakan army, a rebel group drawn from Rakhine state\u2019s Buddhist majority, that says it is fighting for greater autonomy.\n\nYanghee Lee, who recently stood down as the UN\u2019s special rapporteur on human rights in Myanmar, said the military is increasingly targeting civilians, using tactics reminiscent of the 2017 assault against Rohingya that caused global outrage: homes have been burned, civilians detained and disappeared.\n\n\u201cI think the international community should be really scared of what might happen,\u201d said Lee, who urged the UN and its member states to act.\n\nSeven residents from Tin Ma - one of the villages allegedly targeted - told the Guardian the Myanmar army entered their village in February and March. Soldiers harassed locals and fired indiscriminately, according to the residents. Ostensibly they were seeking rebel fighters.\n\nA mother said the soldiers would interrogate residents about whether they had seen the Arakan army: \u201cI said: \u2018No, I have never seen the Arakan army\u2019, and they would say, \u2018Where is your husband?\u2019\u201d\n\nThe troops would return several times, going door-to-door, demanding that families hand over anything they owned - from solar panels and batteries to chickens. Later, they say, homes were torched.\n\nWhenever the army came to the village, the mother would grab her son and take him to a hidden shelter to escape harassment or firing.\n\n\u201cHe cried, and I was afraid his cries would be heard by the soldiers,\u201d she said. On one occasion, the village was also hit in an aerial attack.\n\nOn 16 March, according to multiple testimonies, soldiers began rounding up dozens of men. Aung Lay*, a resident, said he was tied, blindfolded and told that if he attempted to escape, he would be shot. When he was released he went to hide in the bushes, only to discover the body of another man who had been detained.\n\nKyaw Thu said he lay almost entirely submerged in a river for hours as the roundups were happening, along with dozens of people who feared they would be taken. \u201c[Our] lips went black, we were trembling in the water. It was like hell,\u201d he said. He left the village the following day. Up to 10 people remain missing.\n\nAfter the residents fled, homes were allegedly torched. Two residents who returned to watch over the village said they witnessed soldiers deliberately burning homes on 22 and 23 March.\n\nVillagers who spoke to the Guardian did so on the condition of anonymity. It is not possible to verify their accounts: there is a virtual ban on foreign media in Rakhine state, local journalists face harassment, and the internet has been blocked in some areas for almost a year, hampering the documentation of abuses.\n\nHowever, satellite imagery provided by Planet Labs Inc and analysed by Human Rights Watch confirms about 140 buildings were affected by fire in Tin Ma, probably on the dates described.\n\nFurther analysis confirms about 180 buildings were affected by fire in another village, Pyaing Taing, also in Kyauktaw township, also likely in March.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Satellite image recorded on May 14, 2020 showing approximately 140 buildings affected by fire in Tin Ma, Rakhine State that likely occurred between March 22 and 23, 2020.

His home was raided at night on 31 March.\n\n\u201cMy son, a three-year-old boy, cried all the time when he saw a group of people with hardest faces at midnight.

Displacement and \u201cabuses of all civilians\u201d would also increase.\n\nThe Myanmar government was not reachable for comment, but a spokesman has previously rejected recent allegations of war crimes. He accused outgoing UN envoy Lee of bias, and blamed rebels for violence.\n\nAung San Suu Kyi, Myanmar\u2019s civilian leader, has not commented on the claims but, in a statement in April, paid tribute to members of the military who she said had \u201cdischarged their duties with courage and dedication, and sacrificed their lives\u201d to defend civilians from the Arakan army. She accused the group of \u201cdestructive activities\u201d and said casualties and their families would be given support.\n\nMyanmar has seemed immune to international pressure over its treatment of the Rohingya; despite pledges to improve conditions, the group\u2019s experiences are virtually unchanged. The Rohingya are still subject to vast restrictions on their basic rights.\n\nPeople from Tin Ma want the atrocities inflicted on their village to also be placed under the global spotlight.

Case 1000 is an investigation into gifts received on a regular basis by Netanyahu and his family from two wealthy businessmen, including cigars and pink champagne. Case 2000 is examining whether Netanyahu behaved improperly during a taped conversation with a newspaper publisher in which he appeared to try to negotiate more sympathetic coverage in return for lowering the circulation of a rival paper. Case 3000 is an inquiry into alleged kickbacks in a deal to buy German submarines. Netanyahu is not a suspect, but he was closely involved in the deal and the case has ensnared members of his inner circle.\n\nCase 4000, the most serious, involves allegations that Netanyahu offered incentives to the Israeli telecoms company Bezeq in exchange for positive stories in an online news website it owns, Walla.\n\nNetanyahu chaired the first official cabinet meeting of his new unity government, sworn in a week ago on Sunday morning.

Brazil\u2019s leftist president, Jo\u00e3o Goulart, was toppled in a coup in April 1964. General Humberto Castelo Branco became leader, political parties were banned, and the country was plunged into 21 years of military rule. The repression intensified under Castelo Branco\u2019s hardline successor, Artur da Costa e Silva, who took power in 1967. He was responsible for a notorious decree called AI-5 that gave him wide ranging dictatorial powers and kicked off the so-called \u201canos de chumbo\u201d (years of lead), a bleak period of tyranny and violence which would last until 1974. What happened during the dictatorship? Supporters of Brazil\u2019s 1964-1985 military regime - including Jair Bolsonaro - credit it with bringing security and stability to the South American country and masterminding a decade-long economic \u201cmiracle\u201d. It also pushed ahead with several pharaonic infrastructure projects including the still unfinished Trans-Amazonian highway and the eight-mile bridge across Rio\u2019s Guanabara bay. But the regime, while less notoriously violent than those in Argentina and Chile, was also responsible for murdering or killing hundreds of its opponents and imprisoning thousands more. Among those jailed and tortured were Brazil\u2019s first female president, Dilma Rousseff, then a leftwing rebel. It was also a period of severe censorship. Some of Brazil\u2019s best-loved musicians - including Gilberto Gil, Chico Buarque and Caetano Veloso - went into exile in Europe, writing songs about their enforced departures. How did it end? Political exiles began returning to Brazil in 1979 after an amnesty law was passed that began to pave the way for the return of democracy. But the pro-democracy \u201cDiretas J\u00e1\u201d (Direct elections now!) movement only hit its stride in 1984 with a series of vast and historic street rallies in cities such as Rio de Janeiro, S\u00e3o Paulo and Belo Horizonte. Civilian rule returned the following year and a new constitution was introduced in 1988. The following year Brazil held its first direct presidential election in nearly three decades.\n\n\u201cA horror show,\u201d tweeted Marina Silva, a one-time presidential rival, after she, like much of Brazil, watched the expletive-ridden footage. \u201cThe whole of Brazil has now seen the sinister entrails running the country \u2026 This cannot go on.\u201d\n\nThe video, which is at the centre of a potentially presidency-ending investigation into claims Bolsonaro tried to meddle in the federal police, was divulged on Friday after a supreme court ruling. It shows a cabinet summit at the presidential palace on 22 April \u2013 and a carnival of cusswords and conspiracy.\n\nBolsonaro emerges as Brazil\u2019s curser-in-chief, uttering 34 swearwords, according to local reports. \u201cThese bastards are after our freedom \u2013 that\u2019s why I want the people to arm themselves,\u201d Bolsonaro declares at one point.\n\n\u201cOh just fuck right off. I was the one who chose this bloody team,\u201d Bolsonaro later grumbles about a lack of media praise for his leadership.\n\nElsewhere the rightwing populist rejects criticism over his flouting of social distancing guidelines. \u201cA bad example my arse,\u201d Bolsonaro snaps, before apparently confusing the word \u201chemorrhoid\u201d with either \u201chegemony\u201d or \u201chemorrhage\u201d.\n\nOn a fourth occasion, which could have serious implications for his presidency by providing potential grounds for impeachment, Bolsonaro seems to confirm claims from his ex-justice minister Sergio Moro that he sought to shield his family from investigation by meddling in the federal police.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to wait for them to fuck my whole family or my friends just for shits and giggles,\u201d Bolsonaro says. Nineteen of the president\u2019s relatives are reportedly facing police scrutiny, including two sons, although Bolsonaro denies that is the case.\n\nBolsonaro\u2019s coarseness made front-page headlines but many were most horrified by the lack of focus on Covid-19, which has now killed more than 21,000 Brazilians. \u201cOn the day of the meeting Brazil had already suffered nearly 3,000 Covid deaths \u2013 and the issue simply wasn\u2019t raised,\u201d said S\u00f4nia Bridi, an author and broadcaster. \u201cThis just shows how we\u2019ve been abandoned by the federal government during this pandemic.\u201d\n\nPlay Video 4:15 Why has Brazil been so badly hit by coronavirus? \u2013 video explainer\n\nOne of the only ministers to raise the crisis was environment chief Ricardo Salles who suggested it had distracted the press and provided good cover to enact highly controversial changes to environmental legislation.\n\n\u201cThe minister\u2019s words are criminally opportunistic \u2013 to take advantage of the fact that the country is facing a pandemic to advance this agenda of environmental destruction,\u201d said Fl\u00e1via Oliveira, a columnist for the newspaper O Globo.\n\nAnother source of alarm was an authoritarian outburst from Bolsonaro\u2019s education minister, Abraham Weintraub, who branded supreme court judges \u201cpunks\u201d who needed jailing.\n\nBolsonaro\u2019s human rights minister, Damares Alves, raised the spectre of a supposed plot to contaminate indigenous people in the Amazon with Covid-19 in order to \u201cdecimate\u201d their villages and discredit Bolsonaro.\n\nBridi said the video had left her feeling ashamed: \u201cWe don\u2019t use this kind of \u2018presidential\u2019 language in my house, and my parents didn\u2019t allow it either.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut more than shame I felt sadness,\u201d Bridi added. \u201cThey have no plan for the country \u2013 and the country is now in the hands of people who are worse than unqualified.\u201d Brazil was witnessing \u201cthe empowerment of stupidity and ignorance\u201d.\n\nOliveira said she had been repulsed at Bolsonaro\u2019s \u201cegocentric, shallow and offensive\u201d show. \u201cWhat you see is a government that isn\u2019t in the slightest bit engaged with the most pressing issue, not just for the country but for the whole planet.\u201d Was it any wonder Brazil had been \u201cplunged into this spiral of death, illness, inefficiency and incompetence\u201d when this was the group in charge?\n\nBut one thing had come as a relief to Oliveira, who is one of Brazil\u2019s leading black voices. Bolsonaro\u2019s all-white and almost entirely male cabinet contained not a single Afro-Brazilian face. \u201cThe lack of diversity is shameful \u2026 But thank goodness my black brothers and sisters aren\u2019t part of this. Thank goodness the indigenous are not involved. It gives me the chills to say this but thank goodness this isn\u2019t our work. It\u2019s the work of those who have always had a supremacist and destructive vision of Brazil.\u201d\n\nBolsonaro celebrated his vulgarity as proof he was a man of the people. \u201cIs there swearing? Yes,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cI\u2019m sorry \u2013 if you don\u2019t like it vote for some boring suit next time.\u201d\n\nMonica de Bolle, a Brazil specialist from the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington, said the video was part of \u201ca horror film that is playing out in real time\u201d. \u201cNone of what was said is unexpected.

But after signing an exclusive deal with Spotify, that is what he may have become, marking a new era for podcasting in the process.\n\nTo much of the world, Rogan\u2019s name is most associated with the periodic furores that erupt from the marathon interviews around which his podcast is structured.\n\nElon Musk smoking weed during a 2018 interview brought a lot of heat, for instance, as did Bernie Sanders appearing on the show in the midst of his presidential campaign, less than six months after conspiracy theorist Alex Jones was brought on for his second sit-down in as many years.\n\nPodcasting's Netflix moment: the global battle for domination Read more\n\nBut Rogan\u2019s affably bro-ish demeanour, combined with his sponge-like interview style, has garnered him millions of fans over the thousand-plus episodes of his show, The Joe Rogan Experience. And that has made him a linchpin in Spotify\u2019s plans to transform the world of podcasting.\n\nRogan announced the deal on 19 May, revealing his show would debut on Spotify in September, and become exclusive to the platform some point after that. Terms were not disclosed, but one calculation from 2019 pegged Rogan\u2019s revenue from podcast adverts alone between $50m (\u00a341m) and $250m, with more coming from YouTube, where his shows get a million views in their first 24 hours. Add a premium for exclusivity on top and, says podcaster John Gruber, \u201cit seems likely that Joe Rogan is now the highest paid broadcaster in the world\u201d.\n\nThe Joe Rogan Experience is the second significant acquisition by Spotify for its growing podcast business, after the company bought US sports broadcaster The Ringer outright for nearly $200m in February.\n\nBoth deals, as well as smaller forays into exclusive content around topics such as gaming, true crime, and relationship advice, lie at the heart of the Swedish streaming service\u2019s attempts to transform podcasting from an industry built around a mishmash of open standards and traditional advertising into a platform economy \u2013 with Spotify at the centre.\n\nBy requiring Rogan\u2019s listeners to use the Spotify app to tune in, the company gains far deeper data about who, when and where their audiences are; that, in turn, can be fed through to advertisers, who are more likely to pay higher rates if they can be assured that the target audience is listening. Control of the player also allows Spotify to vary the advertising to the audience, again increasing revenue.\n\nThe benefits are familiar web economics, and many see the transformation Spotify has in mind as mirroring the changes to the wider web that unfurled over the 2010s. \u201cPodcasting feels like the web prior to the roll-up of power by Google and Facebook, with a lot of new voices, some very successful and most marginal, but quite authentic,\u201d said Matt Stoller, author of Goliath, a history of monopolies.\n\n\u201cOnce Spotify has gatekeeping power over distribution and a large ad targeting business, it will also be able to control who can monetise podcasts, because advertisers will increasingly just want to hit specific audience members, as opposed to advertise on specific shows.\u201d\n\nBut Spotify has competition. Apple \u2013 long the corporate leader in podcasting through its control of the Apple Podcast Directory and still the largest global platform for connecting listeners with broadcasters \u2013 has started acquiring original podcasts for itself for the first time, according to Bloomberg News. The two companies, in direct competition over music streaming, could be going head-to-head in a second field.\n\nUntil then, Spotify\u2019s bigger problem is convincing podcast listeners to switch from their favourite app to the service\u2019s own \u2013 which may not have access to all the shows available in the open ecosystem.

We reveal the feuds, filched raincoats and grotty flats that set her on the path to stardom\n\nIf you were in Liverpool in 1982 and had a habit of wandering down Mathew Street, perhaps on your way to Probe record store, you are likely to have seen Courtney Love. She was 17 and living in the city, having been invited there by Teardrop Explodes frontman Julian Cope. Probe was one of her favourite places to go \u2013 if not to buy records, then to sit outside on the steps, drinking cider with her friend from back home in America, Robin Barbur.\n\nA hundred yards from Probe was the site of Eric\u2019s. From 1976 to 1980, Eric\u2019s had hosted everyone from the Ramones to Joy Division. One band formed by the venue\u2019s regulars was Big in Japan with lineups including Jayne Casey (later of Pink Military), Bill Drummond (later of the KLF), Holly Johnson (later of Frankie Goes to Hollywood) and Ian Broudie (later of the Lightning Seeds). \u201cWe were the most damaged children society turned out that year!\u201d recalls Casey. \u201cAnd we just happened to be on stage together.\u201d\n\nLove wanted to get close to them, particularly the Teardrop Explodes and Echo & the Bunnymen. She later recalled seeing Ian McCulloch of the Bunnymen \u201cswanning around\u201d the city: \u201cHe used to wear a big thick coat and glasses and hang out with Pete Wylie and mumble.\u201d Wylie, of the band Wah! Heat, also had a big coat. Liverpool winters are cold \u2013 but the coats stayed on at parties and gigs. Love claims she once stole McCulloch\u2019s, but he isn\u2019t so sure: \u201cI think she might have stolen a look rather than actual clothes. But if she did, good luck to her.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018Love gravitated closer to him\u2019 \u2026 Julian Cope performs with the Teardrop Explodes. Photograph: Brian Rasic/Getty Images\n\nDrummond recalls Love as a \u201cloud-mouthed American punkette\u201d. She was loud, that\u2019s something everyone agrees on. Pete Burns, later of the band Dead or Alive, had a clothes shop at the back of Probe. In his autobiography, Freak Unique, he described how it felt to be assailed by Love: \u201cIt\u2019s like when a baby throws a rattle across the room and screams because it can\u2019t communicate.\u201d\n\nLove\u2019s parents, Linda Risi and Hank Harrison, met at a party for Dizzy Gillespie in San Francisco in 1963. \u201cWe were doing tons of acid,\u201d Harrison recalled, \u201cchanging sex partners, and tripping out.\u201d Apparently, he managed the Warlocks in 1965 before they became the Grateful Dead. Risi, then 19, came from a wealthy family. Love\u2019s grandparents provided her with a trust fund of $500 a month. This paid for the trip to Liverpool.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018Before Liverpool, my life doesn\u2019t count\u2019 \u2026 Love in Sefton Park. Photograph: Robin D Bradbury\n\nOn 9 July 1964, Risi gave birth to Love Michelle Harrison \u2013 later known as Courtney. But Risi and Harrison fought and, after they divorced in 1970, a custody battle ensued. Risi and one of Harrison\u2019s girlfriends testified that he had given his daughter LSD when she was four.\n\nBy the end of 1973, Risi had moved to New Zealand, leaving Love behind. She was just eight. She finally ended up in an institution for wayward teenagers, after being caught shoplifting. By the time she was 17, she had decided to leave behind her unhappy San Francisco childhood and, in 1981, set off for Ireland. She moved into a squat in Dublin and started hanging out at music venue McGonagles, where she collided with the post-punk Liverpool scene.\n\nThe Teardrop Explodes played Dublin in December. According to Bernie Connor, who was mates with Cope and sold T-shirts on the tour, Love passed the monitor engineer a note for Julian. \u201cAre you married?\u201d it said. \u201cSo Courtney comes back to the hotel,\u201d continues Connor, \u201cattaches herself, and gravitates a little closer to Julian with every passing minute.\u201d\n\nCope gave Love and Barbur his Liverpool address and said they could stay, neglecting to mention he wouldn\u2019t be there. They soon moved in to a \u201chorrible\u201d flat in Princes Avenue.Love recorded it all in her diary, from the \u201ctextured tawny-beige-green and brown-silver and white-old-human wallpaper\u201d to \u201cswirlfudgesludgepatterned earth tones carpet\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Right place, right time \u2026 Liverpool\u2019s Albert Dock was redeveloped in 1982. Photograph: Mirrorpix/Getty Images\n\nIt possibly didn\u2019t feel like it, as they sat in their coats in a cold, dimly lit flat on the edge of Toxteth, but Love and Barbur were in the right place at the right time. In April 1982, John Peel broadcast a Radio 1 show live from Liverpool. The week-long extravaganza fuelled and celebrated the scene that so thrilled the girls. It was a time of energy and ambition, with bitchiness galore.\n\nWhile the sharp-tongued Burns was often at the centre of the acrimony, one feud \u2013 between Cope and McCulloch \u2013 has had a staggering shelf life. The pair haven\u2019t had a good thing to say about each other in the four decades since. In Liverpool, making music and making enemies went hand in hand \u2013 a lesson that would stand Love in good stead.\n\nDavid Balfe at Liverpool label Zoo was keen to launch a female version of Soft Cell, so he lent her a synth and a four-track recorder. She didn\u2019t know how to use them, but his enthusiasm galvanised her. As for the compositions, it seems her sludge-coloured flat came in handy. \u201cI went on about porridge,\u201d she recalled, \u201cbecause all we had was porridge.\u201d While she describes the songs as \u201cstupid\u201d, they at least reflected her life in Liverpool. One of the first numbers was an ode to Cope, with a chorus beginning: \u201cJulian, Julian, where have you been?\u201d\n\nLove once once said: \u201cBefore Liverpool, my life doesn\u2019t count. Ian McCulloch and Julian Cope taught me a great deal. I owe them a lot. Liverpool had been a great school to become a rock star.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018You buy a guitar and it burns like a coal in your hand\u2019 \u2026 Love fronting Hole in 1995. Photograph: Ian Dickson/REX/Shutterstock\n\nUnderstanding the mechanics of songwriting, and finding ways to channel influences and experiences, is important \u2013 but attitude counts too. \u201cJulian told us to live your life as if you\u2019re being followed by a movie camera,\u201d Barbur later said. \u201cI remember Courtney started walking very self-assuredly, head up, fast.\u201d\n\nA decade later, when Love was the frontwoman of Hole and married to Nirvana\u2019s Kurt Cobain, Cope took out an advert in the NME that said of her: \u201cFree us from Nancy Spungen-fixated heroin A-holes who cling to our greatest groups and suck out their brains.\u201d What was it that had got under Cope\u2019s skin? \u201cShe was always in your face,\u201d says Connor. \u201cI was able to detach myself, whereas she lasered in on him. I can understand it oppressing him.\u201d\n\nBarbur is less forgiving. \u201cJulian was crazy. It was part of the charm. I don\u2019t want to be a bitch, but maybe by this point she\u2019d got a little famous and he\u2019d got a little bit bitter. He hadn\u2019t seen her since she was 17, 18. He probably saw this bratty, obnoxious girl was now a superstar pretty much, and thought, \u2018Damn her.\u2019 I don\u2019t know. She really adored Julian.\u201d\n\nLove wrote to Cope and said that his ad had made her violently ill: \u201cImagine that it\u2019s 1983, 82, 81 and 80, you\u2019re a teenage piece of white trash and not even remotely decorative, but you love the great rock dream and it\u2019s all you\u2019ve got \u2026 And you buy a guitar and it burns like a coal in your hand and you feel some power and for once it isn\u2019t the power of being made fun of or picked on, it\u2019s [\u2026] the power to change the fucking world.\u201d\n\nI suggest to Connor that if Love had been a bloke with handfuls of drugs, bowling through life all mouthy and opinionated, then she\u2019d have been treated like some hero from a Kerouac novel. \u201cUndoubtedly. We were very young and so was she. And being in your face like that, that was new. We were quiet young fellas, it was a closed little network.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018Best British band ever\u2019 \u2026 Ian McCulloch of the Bunnymen. Photograph: Leon Morris/Getty Images\n\nThe best days of the Teardrops were over by then. In fact, they\u2019d been over by July 1982, when Love had gone home. Mick Houghton, the band\u2019s PR, remembers how Cope was at that time. \u201cHe knew he no longer belonged in Liverpool \u2013 and that, as a group, they no longer belonged anywhere.\u201d\n\nBut the glory days of Echo & the Bunnymen \u2013 who Love called \u201cthe best British band ever\u201d \u2013 were still to come. Other bands from the Eric\u2019s scene became huge, too. Frankie Goes to Hollywood\u2019s Relax became the first of three consecutive singles to hit No 1. Dead or Alive\u2019s You Spin Me Round (Like a Record) also climbed to the top. Even Pete Wylie\u2019s Wah! scaled the top five with The Story of the Blues. So the city Love left kept loudly knocking out hits, having shown a girl who had grown up with no one listening to her how to assert her identity, and what was possible.\n\nOn 21 July 1982, she caught the National Express bus to Heathrow, stopping off for egg and chips in the Midlands. At the airport, she wrote in her diary: \u201cI can play music and understand technology. I can stay in and resist the temptation to make the first move, or stay too long or worse get intense. I can make tea now. I can remain enigmatic, pose well and appear feminine.\u201d She thinks about all the people she met and concludes: \u201cThere\u2019s one asset everyone has until they\u2019ve spent it. Their mystique.\u201d\n\nAhead lay fame, some terrible choices, loss and hurt. Rock\u2019n\u2019roll was her dream, Liverpool her inspiration, and fronting Hole gave her a voice \u2013 an honest, unignorable, insistent voice that broke the silence.\n\n\u2022 Dave Haslam\u2019s Searching for Love: Courtney Love in Liverpool is available from Confingo.\n\n\n\n", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/may/25/courtney-love-in-liverpool-scousers-wild-child-how-to-rock", "published": "2020-05-25T00:00:00", "author": ["Dave Haslam"]}, {"title": "Why is Trump so quiet about the Biden sexual assault allegation?", "text": "Sometimes Donald Trump portrays his election rival, Joe Biden, as a sleepy geriatric who should be in a care home because \u201che doesn\u2019t know he\u2019s alive\u201d. At others, the president speaks of Biden as a wily manipulator who conspired with the deep state and China.\n\nWho is Tara Reade and what are her allegations against Joe Biden? Read more\n\nBut in this scattergun approach, the US president has been uncharacteristically reluctant to use what, in normal times, would seem standard political ammunition: an allegation of sexual assault.\n\nIt took more than a month after Tara Reade, a former Senate staffer, alleged on a podcast that Biden sexually assaulted her in a Capitol Hill basement in 1993, for Trump to publicly address the matter.\n\nEven then, the US president\u2019s comments on 30 April were unusually milquetoast. \u201cI don\u2019t know anything about it,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI don\u2019t know exactly \u2013 I think he should respond. You know, it could be false accusations. I know all about false accusations. I\u2019ve been falsely charged numerous times. And there is such a thing.\u201d\n\nThen, speaking on Fox News\u2019s Fox & Friends, usually a comfort zone, he again declined to go for Biden\u2019s jugular. \u201cLook, he\u2019s got to fight that battle,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve had battles, too, where I\u2019ve had false accusations, many times. I\u2019ve had many false accusations made, I can tell you that. Many. And maybe it is a false accusation. Frankly, I hope it is, for his sake.\u201d\n\nThe first and most obvious explanation for the president\u2019s reticence is that he himself has been accused of assault and unwanted touching by a long list of women, some far more recently than Reade\u2019s account. He also denies the allegations. On the other hand, Trump has never allowed perceived double standards to get in the way of his scorched earth tactics in the past.\n\nMonika McDermott, a political science professor at Fordham University in New York, said: \u201cIt\u2019s surprising in a way because usually Trump doesn\u2019t pull back on things even when they do seem hypocritical or ironic or choose your adjective. Yet he is in this particular instance. I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s waiting for something to happen or whether he\u2019s waiting to see how it plays out before he does anything. He seems to be finding what seem to him more fruitful attack routes against Obama and other things and people than against Biden right now.\u201d\n\nIn 2016 Trump\u2019s campaign was rocked by the release of an Access Hollywood tape in which he could heard bragging about using his fame to grab women\u2019s private parts. Instead of quitting, he went on the offensive against his rival Hillary Clinton by highlighting sexual assault allegations against her husband, former president Bill Clinton, and even inviting those accusers to a press conference before a presidential debate.\n\nBut this November will witness the first presidential election since the rise of the #MeToo movement, which has encouraged women to come forward with allegations of sexual assault against prominent men in politics, show business and other industries.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A screen grab of Joe Biden and Dr Jill Biden hosting a family town hall on the Covid-19 pandemic from their home in Wilmington, Delaware, last month. Photograph: Brian Cahn/Zuma Wire/Rex/Shutterstock\n\nBiden has committed to picking a woman as his running mate and frequently cites his work as lead sponsor of the Violence Against Women Act. Both candidates are keenly aware that suburban women could be a pivotal demographic in the final vote.\n\nWhile Trump remains taciturn, Republicans have instead focused much of their response on Brett Kavanaugh, the supreme court justice whose nomination was nearly derailed by sexual misconduct allegations. The Trump campaign pointed to statements made by Democrats during the Kavanaugh episode to portray them as hypocritical.\n\nErin Perrine, principal deputy communications director at the Trump campaign, said: \u201cDuring Justice Kavanaugh\u2019s hearings, Biden made clear that all women should be believed when they come forward with allegations of sexual assault. Biden\u2019s own work during the Obama administration lowered standards for such accusations on college campuses as to effectively institute a presumption of guilt. In a dramatic shift, Biden now says \u2018believe women\u2019 doesn\u2019t actually mean \u2018believe women.\u2019\u201d\n\nTrump himself, however, has preferred to take aim at other targets, seeking to implicate Biden in a so-called \u201cObamagate\u201d conspiracy that many seen as an attempt to deflect attention from the coronavirus pandemic \u2013 likely to prove a more significant issue in November.\n\nAmid Democratic alarm that the Reade allegation could dent Biden\u2019s support among women, the former vice-president vehemently denied it in an interview on the MSNBC network on 1 May and repeated that position in a series of media appearances.\n\nThe story has faded from prominence in recent days, especially after the PBS NewsHour interviewed 74 former Biden staffers, of whom 62 were women, and found none said that they had experienced sexual harassment, assault or misconduct by Biden, nor ever heard rumors or allegations to that effect.\n\nBy pushing the case, Trump may have more to lose than to gain. Rich Galen, a former Republican strategist, said: \u201cThe case against Biden keeps getting thinner and thinner so I\u2019m not sure that there\u2019s much there. And all the people who\u2019s accused Trump, it would be like listing the names of the people who died in Vietnam every night.\u201d\n\nMichael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, added: \u201cTrump, if nothing else, knows how to read his audience: \u2018No, they\u2019re not going to buy anything I sell on this point.\u2019 There\u2019s no need to even open that Pandora\u2019s box because it\u2019s a Pandora\u2019s box for him, not Joe Biden. I think that\u2019s why the president has largely decided not to engage at that level.\n\n\u201cMy sense is right now, despite what others in the campaign may want to do, there is no energy from the president himself to open up that door and go through it.\u201d", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/25/joe-biden-sexual-assault-allegation-why-trump-quiet-tara-reade", "published": "2020-05-25T00:00:00", "author": ["David Smith"]}, {"title": "Surfers brave monster waves as 10-metre swells lash Sydney's coastline \u2013 in pictures", "text": "Over the weekend a low-pressure system hung over Sydney which created swells of up to 10 meters.

I\u2019ve tried to attach a winch to a nearby tree to pull myself out, but it\u2019s not working. I will have to abandon the vehicle, fit up another and try again. This load of timber is not going to deliver itself.\n\nI am playing Snowrunner, the latest in a series of painstakingly authentic offroad delivery simulator games in which players have to haul goods through a variety of unforgiving landscapes at speeds that would shame a garden snail. Before each trip you have to select exactly the right vehicle for the job, fit the correct tyres and work out your likely fuel consumption to the nearest millilitre. On the frozen roads of northern Alaska, there is no room for shoddy planning.\n\nOver the last five years there has been a renaissance in serious job simulator games. Titles such as Euro Truck Simulator, Bus Simulator and Train Sim World have attracted huge fanbases and critical acclaim, each replicating its profession with unremitting attention to detail. In an entertainment sector where ludicrous power fantasies rule, where players get to be space marines, ancient warrior princesses and football superstars, it seems antithetical that 25 million people have bought Farming Simulator, a game in which your main challenge is to harvest a successful wheat crop.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Devoted following \u2026 Bus Simulator 18. Photograph: Astragon\n\nBut it is the very precision of these games that has attracted such a devoted following. \u201cThroughout development we gather a lot of questions,\u201d says Julian Mautner at Stillalive studios, the team behind the Bus Simulator games. \u201cWhen you turn the ignition key once, which functions of the bus actually work, and which icons on the dashboard light up? What happens afterwards when you turn it into second position? These are the details our players really care about.\u201d\n\nAccording to Mautner, the studio has a partnership with its local transport company, IVB (Innsbrucker Verkehrsbetriebe), which they regularly visit to inspect real-life buses and take hundreds of pictures. \u201cWe also talk to the bus drivers about their everyday challenges, about special situations or tricky manoeuvres they had to execute,\u201d he says. \u201cThat provides us with immensely valuable insights into the workings of a transportation company.\u201d\n\nIn an unpredictable world, it is calming to open the doors of a bus at the right time, to give the correct change\n\nMeanwhile, the coders accurately simulate all aspects of engine performance \u2013 gear changing, torque, acceleration \u2013 using information from manufacturers. The audio team makes more than 1,000 recordings of sounds from all around different buses. The artists recreate interiors exactly. As Mautner explains: \u201cNowadays we aim to get actual 3D data for the cockpits, because replicating the details from images and blueprints often led to small inaccuracies that the community noted.\u201d\n\nThe landscapes are vitally important, too. With truck and train driving simulators much of the appeal is the scenery that whizzes past as you\u2019re hauling goods from Berlin to Bonne, or driving a Great Western train to Cornwall. \u201cReal-world references are essential for the world creation,\u201d says Ondrej Dufek, a project leader at SCS Software, the creators of Euro Truck Simulator and American Truck Simulator. \u201cGoogle Earth, Maps and Street View are a vital tools and sources of photo references. On YouTube, there are also videos from truckers who drive across various states and countries, commenting on their surroundings and pointing out interesting stuff. Information about elevation, economy, industries, markets, traffic density, freight routes, weather, even demographics \u2013 everything is important and helps us decide what roads and cities to put in our world.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Not just for pernickety obsessives \u2026 Train Sim World. Photograph: Dovetail Games\n\n\u201cSometimes we\u2019ll take photos straight against a wall so our artists can see what kind of brick is being used,\u201d says Matt Peddlestone, a senior producer at Dovetail Games which makes Train Sim World. \u201cAs you go down a route, the supplier of the brick changes because the bricks are being made locally and the colours of the building will change. We want to capture that.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s easy to think of hardcore sim fans as pernickety obsessives, but there is a quiet joy in interacting with these lovingly replicated systems of lights, switches and signals. In an unpredictable world, it is calming to open the doors of a bus at the right time, to give the correct change, to set the heating system correctly, to obey the traffic signs. It is gratifying to see a button, to press it and to know something will happen.\n\n\u201cI play simulators because by their nature they are internally consistent,\u201d says fan Melissa Harper. \u201cIf you\u2019re playing a game and you\u2019re in a cockpit, and you can\u2019t press all the buttons, that absolutely slaughters the experience for me.

It depended on the context, I suppose; on Bake Off, which is a kind of crucible for affection, it always sounded much warmer than it did on the radio. I have thought about this, on and off, for many years, but nothing prepared me for the experience of being called \u201cdarling\u201d myself: a billionaire who had hired Beyonc\u00e9 to sing Happy Birthday to them could not have felt more puffed up with pleasure.\n\n\u201cDarling,\u201d she starts, over Zoom of course, from what I take to be a stylish, tongue-and-groove shed in her south London back garden, \u201cI miss restaurants. I want some really, really unctuous service.\u201d Over the course of our conversation, she takes me on a whistle-stop tour of her regular social life, her drink of choice (bourbon), the bars where she\u2019d prefer a martini and why she doesn\u2019t have an American accent, even though that\u2019s where she grew up. It is all peppered with the tantalising promise of imminent firm friendship.\n\n\u201cOne day, you and I will get roaring drunk together,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd when I\u2019m roaring drunk, I become extremely American. My wife says to me: \u2018Oh my God, New York\u2019s arrived \u2013 it\u2019s time to go to bed.\u2019\u201d She and the psychotherapist Debbie Toksvig met at a dinner party in 2000, although they didn\u2019t become a couple until 2006. They were civil-partnered in 2007 and got married as soon as it became legal to do so, in 2014.\n\nGreat waves of jubilant nostalgia crash over the conversation: I miss extroverts, bars and Dorothy Parkerish wit. By the end of it all, I hate lockdown more than I have in all these weeks; annoyingly, Toksvig loves it. \u201cI\u2019m allowed to sit in my office all day, every day, and nobody says anything about it or says: \u2018You must come and host an auction.\u2019 It\u2019s marvellous.\u201d She and Debbie have taken up educational cycling. \u201cI\u2019ve got lots of books about quirky bits of London; things my poor wife doesn\u2019t give a fuck about.

They married in 2014. Photograph: Frantzesco Kangaris\n\nWhere would one put her? Certainly, at the start of her career, you\u2019d have said comedian: she was a member of the Cambridge Footlights, as any self-respecting name-of-the-80s had to be. She was a Comedy Store Player before moving into TV, first of all as a presenter on the children\u2019s show No 73. It was not her most distinctive work (she has quite a caustic, not-at-all-childish wit), but is etched into the minds of the now middle-aged.\n\nAt the same time, she was always a writer, of columns, novels, young adult fiction, plays and musicals. \u201cI love the thing of subduing words,\u201d she says. \u201cMy dad was a wonderful writer. He used to describe it as: \u2018First, you catch your fish, then you need to fillet your fish until you serve the finest piece.\u2019\u201d He was a Danish foreign correspondent, and while she grew up mainly in the US, her parents were always on the move, and she has the urbane wherever-I-lay-my-hat outlook of a diplomat\u2019s child: she can be Danish, English and a New Yorker in the course of one sentence.\n\nBy the mid-90s, thanks to the tabloids, she was mostly famous for being gay. It doesn\u2019t seem like that long ago, until you remember how unusual it was then for women in the public eye to come out. And then it feels like centuries ago. The prejudice was extraordinary: Toksvig was stood down by Save the Children, as compere for its 75th birthday celebrations, but a direct action protest by the Lesbian Avengers led the charity to apologise. (Complete tangent, but this is everything that\u2019s wrong with corporate charities \u2013 trying to please the Sun newspaper and the Lesbian Avengers at the same time, instead of having some bloody values.)\n\nBut I am much more exercised about this than Toksvig, who is very funny, even mellow, on the subject. \u201cFor a long time, Deb and I didn\u2019t live in a house \u2013 we lived in a \u2018love nest\u2019. What do they think is going on here? We\u2019re basically going: \u2018Do you think these tomatoes have gone off?\u2019\u201d She never made the mistake of taking the media\u2019s view as a snapshot of the culture. \u201cI\u2019ve always said the British people are nicer, kinder people than the tabloid press would have us believe,\u201d she says, of this and, by extension, every era. \u201cI came out, and the tabloid press thought that I was Cruella de Vil; I never got that from the public.\u201d The mood of the nation prevailed over the bigotry, and \u201cthey\u2019ve stopped putting \u2018lesbian Sandi Toksvig\u2019 whenever they mention me. I don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s because it\u2019s a given, or they\u2019ve just given up. I\u2019m still a lesbian.\u201d\n\nIf all this made her de facto political, she was nevertheless still neutral enough in terms of party politics to be made host of the News Quiz in 2006, and the subsequent decade was the show\u2019s golden age, with Toksvig and the much-mourned Jeremy Hardy perfecting an intoxicating double act; Hardy with his fireworks of grumpiness, and Toksvig batting him back with a paw, like a dog and a cat in perpetual high jinks. \u201cMy love for that man knows no bounds,\u201d she says, mournfully, \u201cThe best bits were not broadcastable. He would dare to do any topic of any kind. There was a terrible story \u2013 some Austrian man had kept his children in the basement for years. Jeremy started on why this couldn\u2019t possibly have happened in England because of the planning regulations: \u2018You couldn\u2019t possibly have a loo off the kitchen like that.\u2019 He referred to it as the Von Trapped family. It was appalling and hilarious. And I just sat there.\u201d Toksvig quit the News Quiz in 2015 to co-found the Women\u2019s Equality party (WEP). Hardy, she says, \u201calways used to tease me that I\u2019d started the Women\u2019s Nagging party\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Presenting QI \u2026 \u2018They give you all the answers.\u2019 Photograph: Brian Ritchie/BBC/Talkback/FremantleMedia/Brian Ritchie\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a shame,\u201d she says, \u201cif people aren\u2019t straightforward about their politics,\u201d and there\u2019s no time in her career when you\u2019d have mistaken her for a rightwinger. Apart from anything else, as she points out, \u201cthe rightwing comedian is a rare soul. We longed to have Tories on [the News Quiz]. They just turned out to be not very funny. They\u2019re not very self-effacing.\u201d However, for all the outre jokes (\u201cThe Tories putting the N into cuts \u2013 that was actually written for me by a man called Simon Littlefield\u201d), I\u2019ve never heard her as blankly dismayed by the ruling party as she is today. \u201cIt\u2019s an interchangeable group of schoolboys who, bafflingly, have found themselves in charge. If Boris Johnson were my child, after he\u2019d given that speech [she means the Sunday evening address in which he ordered people to return to work while remaining at home], I\u2019d have said to him: \u2018Darling, I think you\u2019re still not well. I think you\u2019re overtired. A speech of such vacuousness \u2026 why did you make it? And why have you put a side table that needed refinishing in a doorway and sat behind it? How is this going to fill anybody with confidence?\u2019\u201d\n\nShe is still very upset about Brexit, and chlorinated chicken \u2013 \u201cWe\u2019re going to get no-deal, and nobody\u2019s going to notice.\u201d Great. Fresh waves of nostalgia. Now I also miss remainiacs and Jeremy Hardy, and the phase of parenting when you\u2019re allowed to tell someone they\u2019re tired. This, incidentally, is why even before 2015 and the WEP, it always felt as if Toksvig was allowed to skate closer to politics than other broadcasters: even when she\u2019s talking about a prime minister she plainly has no respect for, she manages to couch that quite fondly. She would turf him out of Downing Street, given the chance, but she would ruffle his hair first, and he would probably be glad of it.\n\nIn 2016, she took over from Stephen Fry as the presenter of QI; indeed, technically, it\u2019s the next season we\u2019re here to talk about, along with her podcasts, called Vox Toks, wonderful vignettes telling the unheard histories of women. And although she will occasionally divert into one of those \u2013 Emma Cons, for instance, who opened the Old Vic and fought for working-class access to education as well as the vote for women \u2013 she talks quite dismissively about her own work. I have never interviewed anyone more fiercely resistant to plugging the thing they\u2019re supposed to plug.\n\nBake Off is a job; you try to do your best, and you go home\n\nIt was considered quite a high-risk enterprise to replace Fry at all, since his very distinctive hosting style \u2013 veering expertly between pompous and skittish, headteacherly and rebellious \u2013 was so baked into the show\u2019s success. Toksvig doesn\u2019t have much patience with this kind of mystique-building on quizshows or, indeed, anything. \u201cI\u2019ve been a broadcaster a really long time. I don\u2019t know what there was to worry about. I ask a question and then I see if anybody else knows the answer.\u201d People kept asking her how she would fill Fry\u2019s shoes. \u201cI hadn\u2019t planned to wear his shoes,\u201d she recalls archly, \u201cso it\u2019s really not a problem. And, also, they tell you the answers beforehand; he doesn\u2019t know it all. I hate to break it to you. It\u2019s like a boy\u2019s card trick: \u2018Look at me! I know everything.\u2019\u201d\n\nWhen, in 2017, she and Noel Fielding took over Bake Off from Mel and Sue, the pressure was even more intense, because they\u2019d turned a quirky idea into this incredible cash cow, and all the world\u2019s producers were wondering what the exact ingredients were that would keep the cow alive. \u201cPeople were in a state of ashen terror. I\u2019ve never seen so many executives look so pale. You\u2019d be doing something, with 40 people behind the camera, staring, shaking their heads.\u201d As ever, she refused to engage with this psychodrama. \u201cIt\u2019s a job; you try to do your best, and you go home.\u201d She quit the show earlier this year to work on other projects, and is being replaced by Matt Lucas. Did she ever experience any pressure, being a national treasure, taking over from two other national treasures, on a show that is itself a national treasure? \u201cI\u2019m diffident about that kind of thing. I don\u2019t know what it means. I just try to be a good person, try to do things for good effect.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest On a Christmas edition of Bake Off. Photograph: C4/Love Productions/Mark Bourdillon/PA\n\nThe projects she speaks most passionately about aren\u2019t TV at all, but the musicals she has written, most recently, one with her sister, Jenifer Toksvig, a librettist (whom she talks about so admiringly that I nearly wrote \u201cthe wonderful librettist\u201d, on a reflex). \u201cAt Christmas, my sister and I wrote a show for the Globe theatre called The Snow Globe, and we made it snow inside, and we made people roar, and they were happy. It was wonderful theatre. It was a great thing to do, to watch adults behave like kids.\u201d They\u2019ve just been commissioned to write an opera together, but she won\u2019t tell me the plot because Jenifer would kill her.\n\nThe prospect of doing the job delights her, even while realities of the world are always biting. \u201cI have not heard one single government person talk about theatre. I\u2019ve not heard one person discuss the reopening of live art. This is important. We need to gather and have those communal experiences. We need that thing, where you leave a theatre feeling better than when you arrived. I feel like I\u2019m flying when I do live shows.\u201d I think, on balance, that\u2019s the box you\u2019d put her in, if not comedian, host or writer: \u201cPerson whom you leave feeling better than when you arrived.\u201d\n\n\u2022 QI returns to BBC Two on Thursday 28 May, and Sandi Toksvig\u2019s new podcast We Will Get Past This is available on all podcast platforms.\n\n\n\n", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/may/25/sandi-toksvig-i-came-out-and-the-tabloid-press-thought-i-was-cruella-de-vil", "published": "2020-05-25T00:00:00", "author": ["Zoe Williams"]}, {"title": "'Many will starve': locusts devour crops and livelihoods in Pakistan", "text": "Mir Gul Muhammad, a farmer in Balochistan province, was blunt. \u201cThe worst that we have ever seen, ever, in our whole life,\u201d he said of the swarms of locusts that descended on his village of Gharok.\n\n\u201cI cultivated around 50 acres of cotton crops and all of them have been eaten and destroyed by locusts,\u201d he said. \u201cBesides cotton, my other crops \u2013 onion, chilli and tomato \u2013 have been affected badly too.

Now, all that amount is gone.\u201d\n\nPakistan will incur losses of about \u00a32bn in winter crops, such as wheat, and a further \u00a32.3bn in the summer crops being planted now, according to the UN\u2019s Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).\n\nA farmer whose wheat crop was wiped out by locusts in Balochistan province.

Pakistan is already suffering from crippling inflation, which is now at a 12-year high, and the unprecedented economic burden imposed by the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe cost of flour and vegetables had already risen 15% this year, and the locust infestation could make even basic food staples unaffordable.\n\nIsmail Rahoo, state minister of agriculture for Sindh, described the plague as a \u201cdangerous and catastrophic threat to the economy, agriculture and food security in Pakistan\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis year it will be ten times worse than last year. They are attacking from three sides,\u201d he said. \u201cThe locusts and their eggs have now covered 50,000 square kilometres of farmland. We are expecting them to infest more than 5m hectares. And they are not just attacking Sindh province, but also the agricultural areas of Punjab and Balochistan.\u201d\n\nHeavy rains on the Arabian peninsula in 2019 triggered explosive growth in the locust population, and they began causing problems in India, Pakistan and a number of African countries last year. The second generation is 20 times bigger. Locusts move in swarms of up to 50 million, can travel 90 miles a day, and lay as many as 1,000 eggs per square metre of land.\n\nRahoo said the federal government had ignored various requests to spray pesticide from the air, something he said the Sindh state government did not have the resources to do.\n\nMuhammad Akram Dashti, a senator from Balochistan, gave a speech in parliament in May 2019 urging the federal government to start preparing for the locust plague that had just emerged in his province.\n\n\u201cIt could have been prevented,\u201d he said. \u201cI raised this issue when it was confined to a division of Balochistan province. It\u2019s the responsibility of federal government to help farmers against such destruction, but the federal government didn\u2019t take it seriously.

Why did it take so long?\n\nAhmaud Arbery was shot on 23 February when Gregory and Travis McMichael, a white father and son, pursued Arbery after spotting him running in their neighbourhood. Gregory McMichael told police he suspected Arbery, who is black, was a burglar and that Arbery attacked his son before being shot.

The technology does not yet exist to track and trace the prime minister\u2019s chief adviser to ensure that he is complying with the lockdown rules that the rest of the country has been drilled to obey.\n\nSince his rule-breaking was revealed, there has been a wave of demands for the resignation of Dominic Cummings and it is likely to grow stronger after today\u2019s additional allegations. This much is common ground and undenied by Downing Street. He left his family home when his wife had coronavirus symptoms and he feared he had contracted the disease, which it turned out he had. They travelled a long way: London to Durham is not a trip to the local shops for essential items. His Durham-based parents, both in their seventies, are in a high-vulnerability age group. That was a breach of the rules on lockdown which the entire nation was expected to obey on penalty of being found in transgression of the law. The government instructions which he had a hand in drawing up were not vague, but crystal in their clarity. If any member of a household has symptoms, \u201cdo not leave your home for any reason\u201d.\n\nNumber 10 has been trying to bat off the demands for his resignation by depicting this as a human story, deserving of our compassion, in which worried parents needed help with childcare. They took a suspiciously long time to weave together this defence. The official statement was only issued after 10am on Saturday. That was more than 12 hours after the story broke, which is a very long time to produce a response to such a major development in the age of 24/7 media. The statement says that he and his wife made the long road trip because, \u201cowing to his wife being infected with suspected coronavirus and the high likelihood that he would himself become unwell, it was essential for Dominic Cummings to ensure his young child could be properly cared for\u201d.\n\nI\u2019m not convinced that this defence will attract the public sympathy they hope for. Other Britons have faced similar agonies during a lockdown that has presented tough, sometimes heartbreaking dilemmas for many, many people. The rules are nevertheless clear. Anyone with reason to believe they have Covid-19 has to quarantine in their main family home for 14 days. The rules are clear for a reason. They don\u2019t work if people feel free to choose to make themselves exceptions, however much they may think they deserve to be. No infected household, however mighty or modest their status, was supposed to be making 264-mile trips to live somewhere else. The government\u2019s slogan was \u201cStay At Home, Save Lives, Protect The NHS.\u201d It was not \u201cStay At Home (Unless You Are Dom), Save Lives (Not Compulsory For The Prime Minister\u2019s Top Aide), Protect The NHS (At Your Own Discretion If You Work In Downing Street).\u201d\n\nThe chief medical officer of Scotland was impelled to resign for a lesser breach. Neil Ferguson, the Imperial College professor, was forced to quit the Sage advisory group when it was revealed that he had flouted the rules by having his lover visit him at home. \u201cThe right decision,\u201d said the health secretary, Matt Hancock. Public confidence in the government\u2019s handling of the epidemic is badly corroded when key figures behave as if the rules apply to everyone but themselves. When trust, so absolutely essential to the handling of this crisis, is abused and diminished, the public loses faith in the calibre and integrity of decision-makers.\n\nWere we talking about anyone other than Mr Cummings \u2013 were we talking about a less powerful figure than the tea cosy-wearing Rasputin of Number 10 \u2013 he would be gone already. He survives only at the indulgence of his employer.\n\nWere we talking about anyone other than MrCummings, he would be gone already\n\nSo what started as a significant revelation about the chief adviser is already evolving into an even more important story about Boris Johnson and his premiership.\n\nThere was some surprise among Tories when Mr Cummings, a figure previously most closely associated with Michael Gove, was given such a sweeping role at Number 10. The explanation was that Mr Johnson had been impressed with the demotic energy and mendacious but effective messaging that he had brought to the Leave side of the Brexit referendum. He went up further in the prime minister\u2019s estimation by crafting the ultimately successful brinkmanship strategy that Number 10 employed during the bitter battles over Brexit during the last parliament.\n\nSince the Tories\u2019 majority-winning election result last December, Mr Cummings has amassed a vast amount of clout. Though he has not won every battle that he has started, he has made himself one of the most powerful unelected figures ever to work at Number 10. He instigated the resignation of a chancellor earlier in the year when Sajid Javid found his demands too humiliating to bear. One former cabinet minister recently complained to me: \u201cCummings has complete contempt for parliament and for the cabinet whom he regards as shit.\u201d He is the architect of a \u201chub and spokes\u201d design for government which is circulating within Whitehall and intended to make all ministers subordinate supplicants to an all-controlling centre run by him from Number 10 and by Mr Gove from the Cabinet Office.\n\nThere was a hot controversy when it was revealed that the chief adviser had been attending meetings of Sage, the body under the chairmanship of Sir Patrick Vallance, which is tasked with delivering dispassionate scientific counsel to the government. Some scientists on the committee actually welcomed his presence, on the basis that this was the only way to get their advice transformed into policy. They reported that only Mr Cummings could be guaranteed to seize the undivided attention of an easily distracted prime minister who is not renowned for his devotion to detail. That is a measure of his power. That is also an illustration of how dependent Mr Johnson has become on him.\n\nThe prime minister\u2019s first reflex will be to try to brazen this out. He will be cross about the furious cyclone that is now raging around Mr Cummings, but he won\u2019t be personally mortified that his chief adviser didn\u2019t follow the government\u2019s instructions. The prime minister\u2019s own biography is littered with examples of a cavalier attitude towards norms of behaviour. Rules are for other people \u2013 not for Boris Johnson. That has been one of the guiding principles of a life not otherwise distinguished by many principles. His own biography is also rich with examples of blunders and scandals that he has survived simply by refusing to be shamed by them. So his first desire will be for the storm to blow itself out after 48 hours or so.\n\nBut if it doesn\u2019t? This prime minister is also a ruthless calculator of where his personal advantage lies. He will be weighing how much damage this furore could do to him if it doesn\u2019t quickly subside. This story broke at the end of what was already the government\u2019s worst fortnight of the crisis. Number 10 has been forced to perform a U-turn on imposing \u201cNHS surcharges\u201d on foreign-born health workers, a reverse more hateful to the prime minister because he was forced into it after the leader of the opposition pursued him on the issue. Plans for a partial reopening of schools have collided with resistance from teachers and parents.\n\nThe grim death toll in care homes and fresh concerns about the government\u2019s ability to deliver on tracking and tracing have contributed to a febrile mood among Tory MPs. Many of them will celebrate if Mr Cummings is defenestrated from Number 10. They resent his swaggering power, they hate the ill-disguised disdain with which he treats them, and they would be delighted to see him gone. As we enter the delicate and perilous process of easing out of the lockdown without reigniting the epidemic, public confidence in the government\u2019s handling of the emergency has turned negative for the first time since the crisis began. Confidence is not likely to be restored by the revelation that the prime minister\u2019s closest adviser has been breaking the rules.\n\nAnother thing the life of Boris Johnson tells us is that his only core commitment is to himself. Journalistic colleagues, fellow politicians and wives have all found that there is no such thing as the undying loyalty of this prime minister. However important you may be to him for a time, you will become dispensable when he decides you have outlived your usefulness.\n\nDominic Cummings will have the full support of Boris Johnson. Until he suddenly doesn\u2019t.\n\n\u2022Andrew Rawnsley is Chief Political Commentator of the Observer", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/24/the-weak-defence-of-dominic-cummings-further-erodes-trust-in-the-government", "published": "2020-05-24T00:00:00", "author": ["Andrew Rawnsley"]}, {"title": "I thought I was too different to see myself in a novel \u2013 but Sayaka Murata got me", "text": "T\n\nwo years ago in Dublin, I read the English translation of Sayaka Murata\u2019s 2016 novel Convenience Store Woman. The first paragraph described a Japanese supermarket\u2019s cacophony \u2013 tinkling door chime, voices, scanner beeps. I\u2019d been to Tokyo and loved those sounds; and there it was, that embrace.\n\nI kept reading, and kept seeing myself in the narrator. All her life, Japanese convenience store worker Keiko Furukura has had to teach herself how to behave around others. She\u2019s relieved when her head office trainer guides her: \u201cIt was the first time anyone had ever taught me how to accomplish a normal facial expression and manner of speech.\u201d She pretends to share co-workers\u2019 petty irritations, and is serenely oblivious to gossip. When patronised, she only really cares about the logic: yes, yes, that was rude, but was it well argued? I\u2019m autistic, and this is all very me.\n\nI\u2019d thought my brain was too different to appear in a novel, but there I was. I smiled whenever I recognised an experience, which meant I basically smiled for the whole book.\n\nKeiko never clocks off from acting \u201cnormal\u201d. For her and for me, socialising isn\u2019t \u201cleisure\u201d. It\u2019s more work, and there\u2019s no manual. Employers are narrow-minded (\u201cIf I ever became a foreign object, I\u2019d no doubt be eliminated.\u201d), but so are most people, or they\u2019d stop requiring us to mimic them. Keiko feels lonely in the way I often do: not because we lack company, but because praise for a persona that we cultivate for others suggests that no one loves our real self.\n\nThis sentence floored me: \u201cShe\u2019s far happier thinking her sister is normal, even if she has a lot of problems, than she is having an abnormal sister for whom everything is fine.\u201d That\u2019s why I squash my emotions in public. I can\u2019t be happy, because if I do then my voice will go monotone and I\u2019ll forget to make the right faces. I can\u2019t get excited because then I\u2019ll start flapping my hands. I need to really trust someone before I can let myself feel anything around them, since I know from robust trial and error that many people will mock my spectrum traits. Keiko\u2019s words made me feel that in my throat: the repression, and some of what I use to cover it.\n\nI\u2019d thought my brain was too different to appear in a novel, but there I was\n\nIt\u2019s easy to see Keiko as a late-capitalist stooge, but I don\u2019t read Convenience Store Woman as an interrogation of alienated labour. To me, the novel says that if one play-acts everywhere, it\u2019s freeing to have a script. I\u2019d never seen that in fiction: no schmaltzy girl-boss pipe dreams, just bald awareness that all human integration requires pretence if society finds you weird. I loved Keiko. She got it.\n\nThen I read the reviews. Apparently Keiko is \u201cchilling\u201d, \u201can oddball\u201d and \u201clatently psychopathic\u201d. The book is \u201cdepraved\u201d and a form of \u201chorror\u201d, this last because our heroine has a low-paid job. Warn the townspeople.\n\nFor my part, I was entirely Team Keiko. Yes, as a child Keiko bashes two boys with a spade to stop them fighting; but she\u2019s using the boys\u2019 own tool \u2013 physical force \u2013 to achieve a desired outcome. Yes, Keiko sees a dead bird in the park and is confused by her family\u2019s mawkish desire to bury it when they could simply grill it for dinner; but what distinguishes this bird from the other birds they eat? Yes, Keiko muses that despite the hassle of soothing her infant nephew, it would be easier to stop his cries by stabbing him with a cake knife; but she\u2019s only observing. Is she wrong? Can you think of a quicker way? Leave Keiko alone!\n\nI was with her through hell and yakitori. Our thoughts were so similar that no other difference mattered. I\u2019m in my 20s and Keiko\u2019s in her 30s, I\u2019m Irish and she\u2019s Japanese, I like sex and she doesn\u2019t; but we were as one on the cake knife question.\n\nIt puzzles me when people complain of not having \u201cconnected\u201d with a protagonist. I can\u2019t speak for anyone else on the spectrum, but I don\u2019t always need to see myself in books. I\u2019m not saying that I never side with characters. I feel close to Jean Rhys\u2019s bad women, Evelyn Waugh\u2019s fractured Catholics, Helen Oyeyemi\u2019s escapists, Oscar Wilde\u2019s caustic queers. But while I\u2019m pleased when I relate, I\u2019m not dissatisfied if I don\u2019t. Characters usually think and act in ways I find alien. If I needed to bond with them then I\u2019d rarely enjoy fiction. That\u2019s not because I \u201clack empathy\u201d. Non-autistics would feel as I do about \u201cidentifying\u201d if most books were about me and not them.\n\nStill, I loved Keiko for those \u201cMe!\u201d moments.\n\nI try to read generously, and Convenience Store Woman has helped me to approach other novels on fairer terms. When you recognise an experience in a book, an experience you had been looking for everywhere else to no avail, then it becomes easier to accept that most books weren\u2019t trying to depict that experience in the first place. They\u2019re still worth reading, those books, but the rewards lie elsewhere.\n\nBetter yet, Convenience Store Woman has given me confidence in my own work. I write to allow myself one place, just one, where I can use my mind as it is instead of corseting it to look like other people\u2019s. My debut novel, Exciting Times, isn\u2019t about my life; but it came from my brain, so it reflects how I process the world. I needed Keiko, and I never would have found her if her creator had pandered to \u201cuniversality\u201d. So I\u2019ll keep writing from my interior, and other authors can write from theirs. Some books teach us about ourselves. Others teach us that not everyone\u2019s the same.", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/25/novel-sayaka-murata-convenience-store-woman", "published": "2020-05-25T00:00:00", "author": ["Naoise Dolan"]}, {"title": "Ben Jennings on Dominic Cummings' roaming charge \u2013 cartoon", "text": "What term do you want to search?

The spike in attacks has renewed fears about the group\u2019s resurgence, a year after the collapse of its physical caliphate in eastern Syria and only six months after the killing of its former leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. The heightened activity is especially worrying because the conditions that have made it possible appear set to worsen in the coming months.\n\nIsis has never ceased attacks in the two countries since the loss of its territories, but the recent operations are particularly bad news. Aside from the attacks, for example, reports from the ground consistently suggest that the group has had greater visibility and mobility this year in villages and suburbs across Iraq and Syria.\n\nThe way in which some of the attacks were conducted also indicates that the group has access to information about troop movements and individuals it seeks to target. Such trends are usually early signs that the group has established roots, carved out space for itself and built the infrastructure necessary to launch attacks.\n\nThis recovery is recent, and follows at least a year of weakness in both countries, due to the loss of Isis centres in Mosul and Raqqa and the intense military campaigns against it. This weakness reached its lowest point with the killing of Baghdadi in October. The group seemed unable to carry out revenge attacks for the killing of its self-proclaimed caliph, or to exploit significant openings such as the US announcement that it was withdrawing its troops from Syria, which was followed by Turkey\u2019s invasion of parts of the north.\n\nWarnings that such events would open the door for the group to re-emerge did not transpire. Several months later, though, the group rebuilt its capabilities and became more active \u2013 the most active since the collapse of its caliphate. This time lag between decreased pressure and the ability to rebound matters because it reveals precisely how Isis could be put back in its box.\n\nIt took Isis some time to regenerate because the sustained military pressure against it had prevented it from quickly seizing clear openings such as the chaos that followed the American withdrawal \u2013 which was later reversed \u2013 and the Turkish invasion. The pressure had been building steadily against Isis since the recapture of Mosul in 2017 and Raqqa in 2018, and the US-led forces largely focused on clearing operations in abandoned villages, mountains and deserts to ensure a more enduring defeat of the organisation. It would have been hard to contain the organisation had it been \u201cready\u201d to attack when such opportunities presented themselves in October.\n\nAfghan security forces with arrested alleged Isis fighters on 10 April 2019.

The initial US withdrawal from Syria caused its allies on the ground, the Kurdish-dominated forces, to seek the help of Russia and the regime in Damascus to prevent Turkey from taking over. Even after the US reversed its decision to withdraw, part of the third of Syria previously controlled by the international coalition became shared with the Russians. The damage was already done, as the international mandate against Isis shrank in both territory and influence.\n\nIn Iraq, too, mass protests in Iraq in October triggered several events and raised the political temperature in the country. The protests in central and southern Iraq forced the government to resign and led to political stagnation that lasted until two weeks ago, when political parties agreed on a new prime minister, Mustafa al-Kadhimi.\n\nThe protests, which sometimes included an anti-Iran tone, also added to the tensions between the US and Shia forces in the country. Attacks and counter-attacks, by the US and Iranian proxies, ultimately led to the killing of the Iranian general Qassem Suleimani and the prominent Shia militia leader Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis.\n\nDespite what seemed like a perfect storm, Isis could not expand its influence until recently. The earliest notable attack happened on 9 April, between the group and Syrian regime forces near Palmyra in the Syrian desert. The attack appeared sophisticated, as the group ambushed regime forces and clashed with them for several hours. Later that month, Isis conducted several attacks in Kirkuk, Diyala and Salah ad-Din. Such attacks included the attempted storming of the counter-terrorism and intelligence directorate in Kirkuk, and several coordinated attacks in Salah ad-Din. The attacks were among the most sophisticated in years.\n\nIsis clearly benefited from the security vacuum and decreased pressure in both countries. As Isis establishes a foothold, it soon becomes hard to weaken it without deeper international engagement. Renewed tactical operations might force it underground but it will not dismantle its networks, because that process requires a patient counter-terrorism strategy that seemed to exist a year ago.\n\nThe recovery of Isis is still new and fragile, and so could be easily reversed if the pressure is restored. However, the problem is that the current trends seem more favourable to Isis than to local forces. Tensions between the US and Iraqi forces also make it harder for the two partners to work in harmony as they did during the fight against Isis in places like Mosul. The US has already withdrawn from several tactical bases in western and central Iraq, in the very areas in which it recently carried out attacks.\n\nIn other words, the chances for further Isis recovery are increasing as the odds decrease for a tougher crackdown led by the US. This pattern is what makes the current phase particularly dangerous. If the pattern continues in the coming months, Isis is likely to become a far greater threat that will be much harder to contain than it is now.\n\n\u2022 Hassan Hassan is the director of the non-state actors and geopolitics programme at the Center for Global Policy thinktank, and co-author of the New York Times bestseller ISIS: Inside the Army of Terror", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/24/islamic-state-is-back-and-this-time-the-west-is-ill-prepared-to-take-it-on", "published": "2020-05-24T00:00:00", "author": ["Hassan Hassan"]}, {"title": "The Guardian view on Dominic Cummings: the unaccountable elite | Editorial", "text": "Ever get the feeling you\u2019ve been cheated? Boris Johnson has previously lauded the effort and sacrifice of the British people, who for nine weeks of lockdown have endured not only inconvenience and discomfort, but hardship and in many cases real sacrifice: of desperately needed income, of the opportunity to support struggling relatives, see dying family members, or attend the funerals of loved ones. Now it emerges that the rules are optional for the prime minister\u2019s friends. The stated message was: \u201cStay at home\u201d. The unstated: \u201cDo as we say, and not as we do\u201d.\n\nThe breach of rules by Mr Johnson\u2019s adviser Dominic Cummings, revealed by the Guardian and the Mirror, is not an abstruse Westminster affair involving complicated financial dealings, or arcane parliamentary regulations. It is a matter that everyone understands and in which everyone has a stake, because everyone has given up something they valued and many have paid dearly. People feel not just indignation, but rage.\n\nIt is possible that Mr Cummings acted legally, as the prime minister has insisted. But it is certain that he did not act either responsibly or with integrity. To praise him for following \u201cthe instincts of every father\u201d is an insult to every parent who followed the rules instead. Mr Cummings built his power by exploiting the theme that unaccountable elites treat ordinary people as dispensable idiots. In deciding to drive to his parents\u2019 home in Durham, after his wife fell sick, he not only demonstrated his arrogance, but may have put others at risk during any stop on the 264-mile journey.\n\nMr Johnson and his government have been every bit as reprehensible in shielding him. Cabinet ministers \u2013 including, extraordinarily, the attorney general and the health secretary \u2013 have lined up to defend not only Mr Cummings but his actions. They have put saving one man\u2019s career above saving lives, by portraying the rules as nothing more than guidance to be interpreted by individuals. Why, now, should the public be expected to abide by them?\n\nIf Downing Street truly believed that he had done nothing wrong, it would not have obfuscated about where he stayed during the lockdown, nor refused to comment when the Guardian first asked about the adviser being seen in Durham. Nor would Mr Johnson refuse to address the new claims that Mr Cummings further breached lockdown rules by visiting a town 30 miles from Durham \u2013 with No 10 instead adopting the Trumpian ploy of attacking \u201ccampaigning newspapers\u201d.\n\nA growing number of Tory MPs have now said publicly what ministers have said privately, and what is obvious: that Mr Cummings should go. Officials usually take the fall for ministers, not vice versa. That the prime minister has abandoned his already diminished authority for an unelected figure shows that Mr Johnson feels he cannot do without him. The problem is not only what Mr Cummings has done, but what the prime minister does not do.\n\nThe worst possible course would be for the government to seek to assuage anger or divert attention by announcing or floating a premature relaxation of lockdown rules. Its advice has become increasingly muddied and confusing, and the messages defending Mr Cummings have added to the risks that others will disregard it. In one regard only its position is now clearer: as long as Mr Cummings remains in place, it is saying that lockdown is for the little people. And as long as it treats the public with contempt, it can expect that contempt to be returned.", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/24/the-guardian-view-on-dominic-cummings-the-unaccountable-elite", "published": "2020-05-24T00:00:00", "author": []}, {"title": "Lockdown meant I missed my brother's funeral.

It was just a few months ago, and yet reflecting on it today feels like peering into the past through a smeared lens.\n\nWe gathered at the local crematorium and although the occasion was undeniably sad, it also felt quietly celebratory. My neighbour, a doughty 96-year-old, had lived a full and fascinating life, spanning some of the most remarkable events of human history. There was a slideshow of photos, a this-is-your-life eulogy by the celebrant and heartfelt words of remembrance from his daughter. Later, over tea and sandwiches, we swapped stories and agreed that Peter\u2019s was a life well lived; that he\u2019d had a good end.\n\nThe Dominic Cummingses among us don\u2019t have to play by the same rules, accept the same privations, make the same provisions\n\nMy brother died at the beginning of May. Aged only in his early 60s, his death didn\u2019t feel like a timely ending but an early interruption: a life only part lived. He spent his last days in hospital. The staff were unfailingly kind and went above and beyond to make his final hours as comfortable as possible. Although he was in a coronavirus-free ward, visiting wasn\u2019t possible unless we nominated one family member who would have then had to isolate for 14 days.\n\nWhen my mother broke the news that my brother had finally lost his struggle, it triggered unexpected emotions: regret over the circumstances of his death; relief that it marked the end of his suffering; guilt that we hadn\u2019t been close in the last years of his life; and the sadness that came with the knowledge that I wouldn\u2019t be able to be with my parents in their time of unutterable sadness. We live only 50 miles apart, but the government had told us in no uncertain terms that we should stay at home. Mum and Dad, who are in their 80s, have been self-isolating since the start: washing their hands, having groceries delivered and keeping everyone at the required distance. Doing the right thing.\n\nThat\u2019s why it\u2019s so galling to read about Dominic Cummings\u2019s actions. The apparent insouciance with which he travelled the length of the country for reasons most people would judge less pressing than the death of an immediate family member. How can the government say it was OK for him to do that, while having asked so much of the rest of us? How are we to think now of the sacrifices we made? Were they in vain \u2013 or were we just not important enough to be permitted to bend the rules?\n\nIn my mind\u2019s eye, I can picture the kind of funeral we might have arranged, in normal times. I would have driven down to stay with my parents, in my old bedroom. The vicar would have visited, and we\u2019d have planned a service in the local church. I like to think that some of my brother\u2019s old friends would have popped in to help us remember him and that, afterwards, we would have congregated in the church rooms for tea and reminiscences.\n\nOur lockdown funeral was more prosaic. I wrote a eulogy and planned to deliver it in person. But my parents asked me not to travel; told me that it wasn\u2019t worth the risk of either spreading or contracting coronavirus for the sake of a 20-minute slot in the crematorium followed by a socially distanced farewell in the car park. All the arrangements were managed by the funeral director \u2013 flowers, coffin, music \u2013 over the phone. In the end my parents didn\u2019t attend as they were anxious about the potential health consequences of breaking their isolation.\n\nI hear that the service went well. My other brother and his wife (who live nearby) were among a handful of mourners who sat apart and made sure the occasion didn\u2019t go unmarked. The celebrant read my words. The songs my parents had picked were just right. \u201cYour brother would have enjoyed it,\u201d commented one friend.\n\nAnd yet, for me, and for my parents, it almost feels as if none of this has happened. The funerals I\u2019ve attended over the years have helped me to appreciate how the familiar rituals ease the way for those of us who mourn. The pace and rhythm of them allow us to begin our journey of grief and acceptance. There\u2019s comfort in familiar words and succour in the arms of our friends and family.\n\nDominic Cummings faces growing pressure to resign from Tory MPs Read more\n\nOurs isn\u2019t the saddest story of our times \u2013 not by a long chalk.

After 12 years with City he played for Torino, West Ham and Burnley. But Hart has been in goal for Burnley only three times this season \u2013 a Carabao Cup defeat to Sunderland last August and two FA Cup ties, against Peterborough and Norwich, in January. He has been on the bench for all the other games.\n\nA simplistic assessment of Hart\u2019s career would suggest it splits into two halves \u2013 before Pep and after Pep. Hart was told clearly by Guardiola in July 2016 that he had no future at City. Guardiola cannot be accused of being wrong for, in Ederson, he now has an outstanding goalkeeper who is highly accomplished with his feet. But Hart is intelligent and interested in exploring the blurred boundaries of football. Some of his greatest games \u2013 including the 2015 Champions League night at the Camp Nou when Lionel Messi described him as a \u201cphenomenon\u201d \u2013 followed soon after adversity. He is also keen to explain that, despite his predicament, his desire has intensified.\n\nThere are ways we can get our sport back: Leeds doctor on a safe return | Aaron Bower Read more\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s got stronger.

I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve lost the ability, but I know how football works. I just want to be a big part of a club and give my all to them.

He is one of the footballers who Prince William meets in the programme although, as he reiterates here, he has not suffered badly from depression. His career has been in a slump and he wants to share the lessons he has learned. Hart admits \u201cit\u2019s certainly my lowest point\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m sad I\u2019m not playing.\u201d But he sees his long absence from the first team as \u201ca challenge rather than a dark cloud. Mentally, because of what I\u2019ve put in place when I was flying higher and winning leagues, I feel really comfortable talking about my head space.

Photograph: BBC/Goalhanger\n\nIn the 2013-14 season, when he was dropped by Manuel Pellegrini at City, Hart felt angry. \u201cI didn\u2019t really know how to handle tough moments. You just want to bat everyone away: \u2018I\u2019m fine. Just leave me alone.\u2019 I\u2019ve always been keen on my gym work and preparation and a time came when I wasn\u2019t doing those things. It was really frustrating me and a bit of anger came in. Then my place came under threat for the first time.\n\n\u201cThe immediate reaction in my head was: \u2018This can\u2019t be happening. They can\u2019t take me out of the team.\u2019 I tried to train more. Be more aggressive. I was searching, clutching. My agent suggested I talk [to a sports psychologist] who calmed me down by asking: \u2018Do you know how to go in goal?\u2019 I said: \u2018Of course.\u2019 He went: \u2018It\u2019s not that then, is it?\u2019 It turned out it was new goalkeeper coaches trying different styles. It made me realise I was going to cost the team the title if I carried on in goal. Instead of smashing my way through a problem, I needed to take stock.\n\n\u201cI had a good relationship with the manager and we decided to get myself right away from football so that, when I came back, I could just enjoy playing again. That\u2019s when I\u2019m at my best. After five or six games I was back in.\u201d\n\nHart helped City win their second Premier League title in May 2014 \u2013 having been one of the few survivors who had played for the club before they were taken over by the Abu Dhabi group in 2008. He had been a key figure when they won their first title in 2012 and played under six managers before Guardiola changed everything.\n\nDuring all the ups and downs does Hart still see the same psychologist? \u201cYeah, I see Jamie on a regular basis. He\u2019s become a huge part of my life and someone I\u2019ll always work with. Having a sports psychologist helped me realise that you can definitely lighten the load if you lean on people. It\u2019s so empowering when you open up.\u201d\n\nThose lessons help him now. \u201cI\u2019m going to try and get back in the team. And if I don\u2019t, there\u2019s always another transfer opportunity. There\u2019s no point in sulking. I\u2019m still part of the squad. It gives you some power if you have a dialogue with the manager. It\u2019s important to have that when you\u2019re doing well. But it\u2019s even more important when you\u2019re not doing well.\n\n'It\u2019s going to be very hard': pandemic leaves academy players in limbo | Ed Aarons Read more\n\n\u201cI want people who haven\u2019t experienced any adversity in football to learn from this. It\u2019s all very well riding the wave but it won\u2019t last for ever. Every professional I\u2019ve spoken to, has had this ride where nothing can go wrong. Inevitably, it\u2019s hard to maintain. How we react is something I\u2019m keen on trying to help people with \u2013 giving them the tools to deal with those situations.\u201d\n\nBeing on the bench as a goalkeeper is a lonely place which few people understand. \u201cIt is hard but I\u2019m going to be on a [BBC] programme with guys who have real problems,\u201d Hart points out.\n\nHis last Premier League game was on Boxing Day 2018, when Burnley lost 5-1 at home to Everton. Hart winces. \u201cI remember every second,\u201d he says before taking me through a painstaking recollection of the five goals. \u201cI spoke to Sean [Dyche] after he dropped me because I felt I\u2019d had a strong season. The results weren\u2019t great, but we were in transition going into Europe. We were trying to play more football and it didn\u2019t really work.\n\n\u201cHe just said: \u2018Look, Joe, I think you\u2019ve been fantastic but for the good of the team I need to try this one last change.\u2019 Lo and behold Tom [Heaton] came in and did great. The team picked up and went back to their old ways.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been tough. That\u2019s no secret. Pure game-time is difficult because, with the greatest respect to Burnley, they\u2019re not a cup team. Staying in the Premier League is all important. It\u2019s just not my time right now. But I\u2019m determined it will come again.\u201d\n\nDid he and Guardiola also talk openly before City sent him on loan to Torino? \u201cYeah, I made sure we had dialogue. I certainly backed myself to the hilt when we spoke. I listened to what he had to say. There\u2019s more to it than me not being as good with my feet as he wants from a goalkeeper. I realised he needed to make his stamp at City. He had a direction he wanted to go and he\u2019s not exactly struggled since, has he?\u201d\n\nHart laughs wryly. Had he been worried about his future as soon as Guardiola was appointed? \u201cI was fairly concerned. Lots of important people tried to reassure me. But you just have a feeling, don\u2019t you? I came back late from the [2016] Euros and he made it clear when I got there that I needed to be out by that window. That\u2019s Pep\u2019s brilliance. He makes decisions and stands by them. I don\u2019t dislike him. We get on as men and we both love football.\u201d\n\nHart spent a season at Torino and says: \u201cI enjoyed being part of that club. In terms of being in a different country, experiencing a different culture, playing a different league, I absolutely loved it. It\u2019s definitely something I\u2019d love to do again.\u201d Are there clubs looking to sign him next season? \u201cI believe there will be. But they all need to work out exactly what the hell\u2019s going on. I like to think I\u2019m a good catch. I\u2019m on a free contract, I\u2019ve got experience and real hunger. The Premier League has been great for me but I\u2019m more than willing to spread my wings.\u201d\n\nAt the mention of Serie A, La Liga or the Bundesliga, he says: \u201cI\u2019m totally open. I just want to play at the highest level I can. In England, I don\u2019t feel I am going to be able to do that. Maybe if I hadn\u2019t achieved what I\u2019ve done in this league I might not be so ready to step away. Don\u2019t get me wrong. I\u2019d love to have another big chance in England, but it could be difficult.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Hart shows his frustration after Leroy Sane scores for Manchester City against Burnley in October 2018.

I\u2019ve been blown away by the Jordan documentary. What a beast. What a man. What a one-off mindset. It must have been painful to be that direct and aggressive every day.

As she chased Monica Seles\u2019s blows from side-to-side during their 2000 French Open quarter-final match, one vicious drive volley flew straight towards her. Pierce instinctively leaped into the air and connected with the ball between her legs, which lobbed high over Seles\u2019s head and landed perfectly inside the court. The shot has been replayed millions of times.\n\nFor most players, Pierce\u2019s famous tweener would have been a great omen of things to come. But tennis fans had spent a decade as attuned to Pierce\u2019s demeanour as the actual strokes. The question was always, after all she had been through, if she was relaxed and loose enough to ever fly. As the crowd roa red, the answer came: Pierce sprinted the width of the court in glee and a smile glossed her face. A few days later she had beaten the world No 3, Seles, the No 1, Martina Hingis, and Conchita Mart\u00ednez, the No 5, and become the first French singles champion at Roland Garros since 1983.\n\nNaomi Osaka tops Serena Williams as world's highest-earning female athlete Read more\n\nEven today, after the rise of power, weight training and greater racket technology in the women\u2019s game, few players have ever struck a ball like Mary Pierce. After Seles, Pierce was one of the first players to arrive at the baseline determined to excoriate every ball and off both wings.\n\nNobody was ever safe from being rendered a spectator in their own match, not even the greatest players in history. At the 1994 French Open, Steffi Graf watched in horror as she was hit clean off the court, 6-2, 6-2, in the semi-final. \u201cThere was very little I could do,\u201d Graf said. In March 2000, it was Serena Williams\u2019s turn to be obliterated. Williams lost 6-2, 6-1 and her conclusion was almost identical: \u201cEverything she hit was either on the line or a winner. So, I mean, what can you do?\u201d\n\nPierce\u2019s father, Jim, realised his daughter\u2019s potential after witnessing a few of her first strikes of a ball. A measure of her talent was that he had handed her a racket for the first time at the relatively late age of 10, yet she became the youngest American to turn professional, at 14 years and two months.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Pierce\u2019s mother, Yannick, and father, Jim Photograph: Ken Levine/Allsport\n\nAs Pierce began to compete her talent was, for a long time, sabotaged by her father\u2019s behaviour. Jim Pierce built his reputation with swiftness. He trash-talked opponents, he fought with their parents and then loudly berated his daughter in public. He also loved to brag about it. At the 1987 Orange Bowl, one of the biggest junior tournaments, he yelled \u201cMary, kill the bitch.\u201d\n\nThose were just the junior events. Pierce\u2019s transition to the professional tour in the early 90s brought breathless coverage of her father\u2019s antics. Although much of the coverage was critical, plenty was gratuitous. Some people were enjoying this. The ticking time bomb culminated at the 1992 French Open where he was ejected from the grounds after punching two Dutch fans. It would prompt a Women\u2019s Tennis Council law, casually referred to as the \u2018Jim Pierce rule\u2019, which signified that a part of a player\u2019s entourage could be banned from any event. Its eponym soon fell foul of it when he was banned from the tour in 1993.\n\nPierce severed contact with her father and he was banned from tournaments as she filed a restraining order - but that did not stop him\n\nMary Pierce finally severed contact with her father and he was banned from tournaments as she filed a restraining order \u2013 but that did not stop him. He would follow her travels close behind, checking into her tournament hotels. She hired bodyguards, and one day he fought one of them, his blood splattering the corridor of an Italian hotel while his daughter had locked herself in an adjacent room. After years of holding her tongue, she was finally ready to speak about the physical abuse she said she received in a 1993 Sports Illustrated cover story titled: \u201cWhy Mary Pierce Fears For Her Life\u201d.\n\nPierce\u2019s story was a singular horror and a sign of the times, as 90s women\u2019s tennis was defined by the overbearing parent. As she established herself, Pierce had always been compared to Jennifer Capriati, who was a year younger. As Pierce evaded her father in 1993, Capriati, whose career was driven by her prominent father, Stefano, fell off the rails. Mirjana Lucic and Jelena Dokic have spoken out against the abuse they say they received from their fathers. Dokic\u2019s 2017 autobiography, Unbreakable, is a study of the cycle of abuse and her cruel inability to escape her father, Damir.\n\nReminders of the outsized visibility of tennis parents in the 1990s appear everywhere. In 1993, Jim Pierce was interviewed by New York Times contributor Samantha Stevenson about his banishment. By the end of the decade, her daughter, Alexandra, had reached the 1999 Wimbledon semi-final and Samantha Stevenson had become one of the most prominent and eccentric parents on tour.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Pierce kisses the trophy after her straight sets victory over Conchita Mart\u00ednez in the 2000 French Open final. Photograph: Clive Brunskill/Getty Images\n\nTennis parents are no longer as prominent in today\u2019s game, but they are surely still present as children are continually elected as the breadwinners in a sport that still supports only a few.\n\nThe sport presents an opportunity for adult figures to assert power, unlike any team sport. For female athletes, it remains the greatest ticket to wealth \u2013 from her own humble beginnings Naomi Osaka was named by Forbes last week as the highest yearly-earning female athlete in history. But in tennis the financial risks are as great as the possible rewards, and since progress rests on the shoulders of the player, so often they receive the blame when things go awry.\n\nAfter her 2000 triumph in Paris, Pierce would spend another four seasons in the wilderness before she returned to top form again in the spring of 2005, returning to the top-five with finals at the French Open and Wimbledon. She won two slam titles in total, the other being the 1995 Australian Open, and reached another four finals. Her career was ended the following year by a knee ligament tear. Now 45 and a devout Christian, she says her faith allowed her to forgive her father, who died from cancer in 2017, and they were finally able to share a healthier relationship once she retired.\n\nLawn Tennis Association announces profit thanks to Wimbledon success Read more\n\nPierce\u2019s French Open success touched another subject. Born in Canada to an American father and a French mother, she held three passports and had started her tennis career with the USA flag attached to her name. Long before discussions of Andy Murray\u2019s nationality, Pierce was French when she won and American when she lost. Her Frenchness was up for debate, even though she is the most successful French singles player in Paris in the Open era, with finals in 1994, 2000 and 2005.\n\nMany people still fail, or refuse, to understand that an individual can be the product of multiple cultures and represent and appreciate each of them fully. It remains a point of frustration for Pierce. \u201cI played three finals. Who is the French representative who did this in the history of modern tennis? Even today, I feel that I am not accepted as Mary the French. I don\u2019t understand it.\u201d she told Le Figaro last week.\n\nIt is fitting then that, in the good and the bad, from her father\u2019s behaviour at the beginning to the way she stepped into the light and played for herself, Roland Garros will always be her tournament.", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/24/mary-pierce-three-passports-two-grand-slams-one-overbearing-father", "published": "2020-05-24T00:00:00", "author": ["Tumaini Carayol"]}, {"title": "Daniel Abt guilty of using a ringer to drive for him in Formula E esport race", "text": "The Audi Formula E driver Daniel Abt has been found guilty of using a ringer to drive for him in the Formula E esport championship.

It is understood it checked IP addresses and discovered that Abt could not have been behind the wheel. The pro gamer Lorenz Hoerzing was identified as the driver who had sat in for Abt. Hoerzing is an 18-year-old who competes in the FE Challenge series, a parallel championship for esport drivers.\n\nAbt admitted both guilt and contrition in a statement. \u201cI would like to apologise to Formula E, all of the fans, my team and my fellow drivers for having called in outside help during the race on Saturday,\u201d he said. \u201cI did not take it as seriously as I should have.

Hoerzing has been banned from the Race at Home series.\n\nThis is not the first controversy in esport racing. The Nascar driver Kyle Larson was sacked by Chip Ganassi racing and suspended indefinitely from the series after using a racial slur in a virtual race in April.

They\u2019re completely compatible with the Trump White House.\u201d\n\nThis group is lobbying on behalf of what they believe to be right, but invariably experts would disagree on their stance on hydroxychloroquine John Ayers\n\nThe group has questioned whether HIV causes Aids (it does), argued abortion causes breast cancer (it does not), linked vaccines to autism (repeatedly debunked), and even alleged former president Barack Obama used hypnosis techniques to trick voters, especially Jewish people, into supporting him (no).\n\n\u201cThe name does not determine the quality of the group,\u201d said John Ayers, a professor of infectious disease and global public health who studies misinformation at the University of California San Diego. \u201cThis group is lobbying on behalf of what they believe to be right, but invariably experts would disagree on their stance on hydroxychloroquine and other topics and issues,\u201d said Ayers.\n\nAs far as the president\u2019s pronouncements, Ayers said: \u201cWe don\u2019t know if he\u2019s actually even taking it.\u201d\n\nEven as Trump said he was taking the drug, some of America\u2019s most respected institutions have begun to move away from it. Yale New Haven medical center, one of the most respected hospitals in the world, removed the drug from its Covid-19 protocol after three weeks of de-emphasizing it in clinical practice.\n\nMassachusetts general hospital, another world-renowned academic medical center, is giving priority to remdesivir, a drug developed by Gilead, although hydroxychloroquine is provided on a case-by-case basis.\n\nThe FDA has issued stringent warnings about the drug\u2019s potentially life-threatening side-effects and recommended patients on hydroxychloroquine be participants in a clinical trial, or undergo rigorous monitoring, possibly including \u201cbaseline [electrocardiogram], electrolytes, renal function and hepatic tests\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Hydroxychloroquine was approved on an emergency basis by the FDA but studies have shown mixed results. Photograph: George Frey/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe AAPS\u2019s statements on hydroxychloroquine are not its only dubious views on the Covid-19 crisis.\n\nThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended wearing masks in public places to prevent asymptomatic people spreading the disease. In other words, it is mostly a selfless act which protects others.\n\nBut Orient argued that masks \u201care not free of side-effects\u201d and that they \u201cretard oxygen\u201d to the brain. She later added: \u201cI think one jogger even dropped dead.\u201d One man in China reportedly suffered a collapsed lung while wearing a mask, though a doctor in the report said there was \u201cno clear evidence\u201d the mask caused the injury.\n\nWhile prolonged use of some masks, such as N95 respirators, might cause lightheadedness and discomfort, loose-fitting cloth or surgical masks most commonly used by the public are highly unlikely to cause such severe side-effects.\n\nOrient also voiced her support for lifting stay-at-home orders. \u201cThey are destroying the economy, they are destroying people\u2019s lives, there is really no evidence they work,\u201d she said. The economic and social impacts of the lockdowns have been devastating.\n\nBut, there is widespread evidence that stay-at-home orders work, and could have saved thousands more lives had they been imposed earlier. A recent Italian study found the stay-at-home order there prevented about 200,000 hospitalizations. Data from Columbia University found if lockdowns had been imposed in the US two weeks earlier, on 1 March, as many as 54,000 lives could have been saved.\n\nAAPS was formed in 1943, in opposition to a proposal to provide Americans the sort of universal, government-run healthcare established just a few years later in the UK. The NHS would become one of the country\u2019s proudest achievements.\n\nOrient\u2019s group is small, especially when compared with the mainstream American Medical Association (AMA) which has 240,000 members. But it is influential.\n\nBrad Parscale (@parscale) The press is going nuts over @realDonaldTrump taking hydroxychloroquine (prescribed by doctor).\n\n\n\nOf course, if he\u2019s doing it, they must oppose it.\n\n\n\nBut the Assoc. of American Physicians & Surgeons says otherwise.https://t.co/ftqKBQxepk\n\nTrump\u2019s first health and human services secretary, Tom Price, was a member of AAPS. In a 2011 video unearthed by the Washington Post, Price called Orient a \u201ckindred\u201d spirit. He said: \u201cIt\u2019s always wonderful to be in the same room with Jane Orient. Jane has been a hero of mine.\u201d Price later resigned after spending $1m in taxpayer funds on private jets.\n\nAAPS has diligently worked against proposals which would constrain doctors. For example, it sued the Texas medical board to force it to stop relying on anonymous complaints of misconduct against doctors (the group lost).\n\n\u201cMost recently, like Trump, they encourage the use of hydroxychloroquine for treatment of Covid-19, and they think that any oversight \u2013 be it a physician group or state medical board or mainstream medicine \u2013 that makes recommendations against use of that drug or tries to restrict use of that drug is just an affront,\u201d Carome said.\n\nThey think that any oversight \u2026 that makes recommendations against use of that drug or tries to restrict use of that drug is just an affront Dr Michael Carome\n\nThe view of AAPS, he added, is \u201cthat doctors should be basically free to do whatever they want to do, regardless of the level of evidence, and that\u2019s a dangerous perspective for medical practitioners to have in the 21st century\u201d.\n\nSamantha Barstow, a licensed pharmacist and adviser on drug shortages with the company Lumere, said this was a rare and uncomfortable situation for government to be involved so directly in prescribing, but in this case it was necessary.\n\n\u201cThe use for Covid-19 has not significantly been substantiated,\u201d Barstow said. \u201cThe efficacy data is just not there yet.\u201d In the meantime, drug shortages could cause patients with approved uses, such as rheumatoid arthritis and lupus, to suffer without medication.\n\nOnly six drugs have ever been approved on an emergency basis, like hydroxychloroquine, and most recently Gilead\u2019s remdesivir. Some researchers believe past drugs approved this way offer a lesson.\n\nIn 2009, during the H1N1 influenza pandemic, a drug called peramivir showed promise. It was studied in three clinical trials, but despite compelling and transparent scientific evidence, it failed. By contrast, hydroxychloroquine was backed only by limited lab tests and case reports.\n\nNevertheless, Orient argues hydroxychloroquine should be available over the counter. Concerns from scientists have \u201cnothing to do with concerns about safety and concerns about science\u201d, she argued. Her view that lockdowns are \u201cdespotic, tyrannical and completely unwarranted\u201d, and will probably also cause consternation in many circles.\n\nBut on some subjects, all can agree: \u201cOur pandemic preparedness on the whole has been lousy.\u201d", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/24/hydroxychloroquine-trump-us-doctors-coronavirus", "published": "2020-05-24T00:00:00", "author": ["Jessica Glenza"]}, {"title": "Outrage at U-turn on promise to reunite child refugees with UK family", "text": "Charities fear for safety of lone youngsters as draft text of Brexit negotiations shows Britain wants to end sanctuary\n\nThe Home Office has drawn up plans to terminate the current system of allowing child refugees to be reunited with family in the UK, according to a draft text of the government\u2019s Brexit negotiating document.\n\nIt reveals that the UK government will be pushing during the next round of EU exit talks to effectively end the system where unaccompanied minors, often fleeing conflict, are granted sanctuary in the UK.\n\nThe negotiating text contradicts the Home Office\u2019s previous position which states a \u201ccommitment\u201d to reuniting child refugees with family.\n\nIn February, Boris Johnson told parliament he wanted to \u201cdiscuss cooperation\u201d with the EU on family reunion.

Photograph: Dominic Lipinski/PA\n\nIn effect, the process of accepting child refugees would become entirely discretionary.

Kraftwerk\u2019s pioneering approach, using synthesisers and sequenced drum arrangements to evoke robotic or industrial rhythms, became the blueprint for Detroit musicians such as Juan Atkins, who coined the term \u201ctechno\u201d. Forty years later, an array of electronic genres have been created from that blueprint: Schneider and Kraftwerk created a feedback loop between Germany and Detroit that has existed for more than half a century.\n\nWhen Schneider and Ralf H\u00fctter started Kraftwerk in 1970, their influences included several Detroit-based acts including the Stooges, MC5 and, according to later member Karl Bartos, Berry Gordy\u2019s Motown label. Gordy initially worked for the Ford motor plant, and gave Motown an industrialised music production-line inspired by Detroit\u2019s automotive industry. This was the ice-breaker in the conversation between his city and Germany \u2013 Kraftwerk\u2019s automated drums, vocoder refrains and future-facing outlook also stemmed from the conveyor belts, piston-driven machinery and monotonous rhythm of factory life. This inescapable repetition of sound and movement \u2013 programmed, precise \u2013 was present in Detroit and Dusseldorf, both industrial centres.\n\nReleased in 1974, Autobahn provided Kraftwerk\u2019s international breakthrough, setting the wheels in motion for their first tour of the US in 1975. It was a moderate success, but if it hadn\u2019t been for radio and club play \u2013 and the record shops that supplied those DJs \u2013 then Kraftwerk would not have had the impact they did. Downtown Records in New York was one of many spots where Afrika Bambaataa would pick up the records he played in his legendary freeform sets at block parties in the Bronx. Known for its eclectic stock, Downtown (and other similarly idiosyncratic outlets) helped deliver Kraftwerk\u2019s avant-garde sounds to America\u2019s black communities. On the radio in NYC, Frankie Crocker was spinning Kraftwerk records on his WBLS show.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018Kraftwerk\u2019s automated drums, vocoder refrains and future-facing outlook also stemmed from the conveyor belts, piston-driven machinery and monotonous rhythm of factory life.\u2019 Photograph: Library of Congress/Getty Images\n\nIn Detroit, Charles Johnson, more commonly known as the Electrifying Mojo, commanded the airwaves via WGPR-FM. His unconstrained programming attracted a huge following, introducing his audience to obscure European imports and US acts including Prince. Kraftwerk were among the European artists receiving regular play on his show, where Numbers was a staple. In Motor City, the decline of the car industry led to a city-wide economic crash. Science fiction and technology provided optimism, a means to escape, a channel to a brighter future. The situation was similar in postwar Germany: by turning their gaze to the future, Kraftwerk offered hope and new beginnings. Their sound of the future, driven by American rhythms, resonated with the nonconformist presenter, and his support for the group was undoubtedly a catalyst contributing to the birth of techno.\n\nLauded by Mojo\u2019s listeners and Bambaataa\u2019s crowd, Kraftwerk\u2019s music made its way into the clubs, even featuring on Detroit\u2019s legendary Soul Train-inspired dance show the Scene, later replaced by the New Dance Show. In New York, their songs were also regular features on the dancefloor, which the group witnessed first hand when Fran\u00e7ois Kevorkian took Schneider and H\u00fctter out to experience NYC\u2019s underground clubs in 1981. It was inevitable that their experiences in black and Latino clubs would lead to the creation of music that fed straight back into those very communities.\n\nJuan Atkins was an avid listener to Mojo\u2019s show. As with Bambaataa\u2019s iconic Planet Rock, produced with Arthur Baker (another Kraftwerk fan), Atkins\u2019 early work draws heavily on Kraftwerk\u2019s tropes and themes. Upon hearing their sequenced drum programming, he immediately adopted the technique to mimic the group\u2019s tight, robotic rhythms. As Model 500, Atkins used warped vocals and intergalactic computerised effects to envision the future from a Motor City perspective. (Kraftwerk\u2019s influence also made its way to Chicago.)\n\nNew wave, early synth pop, the new romantics, London\u2019s Blitz kids, OMD, David Bowie, Gary Numan, Visage, Depeche Mode, Soft Cell and many other groups from the post-industrial early 80s ushered in the first generation of popular music that was entirely created with electronic instruments. Initially niche, it soon went mainstream and travelled across the continent, resulting in a new wave of homegrown German electronic acts such as Boytronic, Rheingold, DAF and Stratis. In 1988, Virgin released Techno! The New Dance Sound of Detroit, compiled by Neil Rushton. It introduced Europe to the first wave of Detroit techno artists, Blake Baxter, Derrick May and Eddie Fowlkes among them. This first wave of electronic music, inspired largely by Kraftwerk and their electropop offspring, was the US\u2019s reply to the German group.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Berlin\u2019s famous Berghain nightclub. Photograph: Iain Masterton/Alamy\n\nAs the 90s approached, radio DJs such as Monika Dietl were educating Berliners on both sides of the Berlin wall; Mark Ernestus, founder of record shop Hard Wax, was intrinsic to bringing the Detroit sound to the German capital. The fall of the wall in 1989 was pivotal: empty warehouses, factories and derelict buildings provided the perfect opportunity for the city\u2019s large community of outliers to enjoy their newfound freedom to the fullest. Clubs such as Planet, UFO, E-Werk and Tresor became hubs for the new sound. A faction of Detroit\u2019s second generation of techno artists had pushed the genre into a more minimal, uncompromising incarnation, which resonated with Berlin\u2019s punks and misfits. The mood evolved to become more militaristic, the BPMs went up, the vocals disappeared, the rhythms remained monotonous and hypnotic. It transformed into a hardcore hybrid of Underground Resistance-style techno, EBM and gabba, which flourished among Berlin\u2019s anarchistic creative communities.\n\nAround this time, Ernestus traveled to Detroit with Thomas Fehlmann and Moritz von Oswald, with whom he later formed pioneering dub techno act Basic Channel. Their mission was to meet their Detroit heroes and gather up analogue equipment that had been offloaded at many of the city\u2019s pawn shops. They met Mike Banks and Juan Atkins, turning up unannounced at an apartment they shared. This connection would lead to a 25-year-long collaborative relationship and friendship. Meanwhile, Tresor founder Dimitri Hegemann booked Atkins to play along with Mike Banks and Underground Resistance. Soon after the club\u2019s launch, Tresor\u2019s label wing appeared: their first signing was Underground Resistance as X-101. Tresor also signed two of Drexciya\u2019s albums, Harnessed the Storm and Neptune\u2019s Lair, and music from Atkins, Robert Hood, Jeff Mills and Blake Baxter. Dimitri inspired the conception of Atkins\u2019 Borderland project with Von Oswald.\n\nOnce again, rhythm and musical language stimulated the flow of communication between the two cities. Underground Resistance\u2019s anger, political commentary and paramilitary aesthetic, expressed through their uncompromising music, spoke to reunified Berlin and its hardcore punks and hippies. Clubs with virtually no rules and powerful sound systems provided an emotional outlet for the once-divided city, prompting the birth of the first generation of Berlin techno pioneers. Once that connection was made, only the UK could compete in terms of its burgeoning dance music culture and allure for international artists, though it didn\u2019t last \u2013 1994\u2019s Criminal Justice Bill strangling the emergent rave scene.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Revellers at Berlin\u2019s Love Parade festival, 2000. Photograph: Markus Schreiber/Associated Press\n\nAs techno\u2019s popularity grew in Germany \u2013 Berlin\u2019s infamous Love Parade started in 1989 and blossomed into a million-strong party by 1997, and alternative techno centres emerged in Cologne and Frankfurt \u2013 it became fringe in the US. The music moved back underground, as corporate-owned radio and TV stations shifted to commercial dance releases. It reached the point where artists from the States were playing more in Europe than they were in their own country, with a far greater number of techno clubs and festivals providing more demand and more opportunity. But the musical conversation and mutual respect between the two territories has never ceased. In the 2000s, a wave of Detroit selectors including Magda, Seth Troxler, Matthew Dear and Derek Plaslaiko migrated to Berlin. Artists such as Carl Craig and Jeff Mills became closely affiliated with their European counterparts, with both men exploring classical music with orchestras on the continent, as well as launching collaborative projects, including Craig\u2019s long-running relationship with Moritz von Oswald and Francesco Tristano.\n\nFlorian Schneider: the enigma whose codes broke open pop music Read more\n\nWhile national demand dipped, Detroit\u2019s influence on the rest of the world remained consistent. At the turn of the millennium, the very first Detroit electronic music festival arrived, cycling through a few incarnations before settling as Movement in 2006. In 2016, Kraftwerk headlined, bringing their 3-D show to Hart Plaza for a kind of homecoming. Rumours about a Kraftwerk show in Detroit had been circulating for years, going back to that first festival in 2000. The group acknowledged their bond with Motor City during the track Planet of Visions, the statement \u201cDetroit electro, Germany electro\u201d repeating over and over.\n\nH\u00fctter described the link between Detroit and Germany as a spiritual connection. He was impressed \u201cthat this music from two industrial centres of the world, with different cultures and different history, suddenly there\u2019s an inspiration and a flow going back and forth\u201d.

I was aware that whips traditionally operate with a complete code of silence.

I wrote to people who had left office and some were willing to talk to me. I found myself sitting in Walter Harrison\u2019s front room in Wakefield \u2013 he was in his 90s then and known as being the greatest whip of modern times \u2013 and also on a train to Sheffield with a packed lunch to visit Joe Ashton. He later invited me into the House of Commons and we were walking through the lobby when he passed his friend, [Baroness] Ann Taylor, who was someone I was desperate to talk to because she had been a young, working-class female whip from Bolton in the 70s. She unlocked the whole play for me, introducing me to other people and being such a force for good. By complete luck, my constituency MP in Ashfield was Geoff Hoon, who had been chief whip. I wrote to him and we met at the whips\u2019 office. I took mental pictures of everything from the desks to the fireplace. I felt like a spy.\n\nYou have written other politics dramas since This House was first performed in 2012. What draws you to the subject?\n\nI come from a working-class family in a Nottinghamshire mining town. I can only assume my adult obsession with structures of power comes from an absolute sense of powerlessness in a community like that. Despite the human devastation of the economic policies of the 80s and 90s there was very little done to help my neighbours and my family. So it\u2019s no coincidence that I take an interest in the subject.\n\nDo you think political theatre can be an engine for change?\n\nWithout a doubt, but I also accept that a single play may not change a piece of legislation. It\u2019s one factor in a wider cultural movement. We need to take the pressure off theatre as a direct influence, but at the same time its influence is significant. Also, there\u2019s an imbalance in the cultural landscape, with so much of it in London, but this does mean that the political classes are going to the theatre a lot. It was quite surreal to see a range of politicians, from George Osborne to John Bercow, coming over from Westminster to watch This House. Other playwrights might resist cross-contamination between the arts and politics but I celebrate it for all the conversations it can start.\n\nGillian Anderson on A Streetcar Named Desire: 'I was hanging on to reality by a thread' Read more\n\nThe play ends with the \u2018winter of discontent\u2019 and the entry of Margaret Thatcher as prime minister. Would you be tempted to write a play about her reign?\n\nI\u2019m happy to tell you that I\u2019m writing a kind-of sequel. I\u2019ve joked that writing about the period of the 1970s when This House is set feels a bit like the Star Wars prequel: you know the Death Star is coming, and what\u2019s exciting is the journey. The nation\u2019s drama begins when this play\u2019s light\u2019s go down. I\u2019m unofficially doing the next one off my own steam along with Jeremy Herrin [director of This House]. I\u2019ve been working on it for over five years and I\u2019m hoping lockdown will force me to finish it. It\u2019s not a direct sequel but looking at government and whipping in the period between Thatcher and John Major. I delight in finding unlikely heroes and Major was an extraordinary character despite the perception of him at the time. I\u2019ve written about that part of the 1970s when parliament went crazy and this would be the second. The third would be the proroging of parliament but I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d do a trilogy \u2013 I don\u2019t want it to turn into a Bond franchise.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018The idea is that there are two sides, and they will never sit together\u2019 \u2026 Matthew Pidgeon, centre, in This House. Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian\n\nThe drama features the Lib-Lab alliance of 1977 and it was staged while the coalition government [formed in 2010] was in office. Did you want to draw parallels between the two?\n\nYes, it was a conscious decision to go back to a hung government of the past. I wanted to channel the past as a parallel to illuminate what was going on. The power of theatre can exist in the terrain of metaphor and poetry. Going back to a past event can elevate a state-of-the-nation play in asking bigger questions about power, government and democracy.\n\nA Tory whip in the play tells his Labour counterpart that \u2018We\u2019re not built for cooperation\u2019. Do you think parliament is set up to be oppositional, not collaborative? Is the system dysfunctional?\n\nI hope the play asks this question of the audience. We saw how the Liberal Democrats were punished for collaboration with the Conservatives. Instead of seeing partnership the way they do in Scandinavian social democracies, for example, all we saw was betrayal.\n\nOur entire model is built around opposition and the play\u2019s designer, Rae Smith, arranged the stage the way the House of Commons is designed around having an argument. The idea is that there is \u201cmy side\u201d and \u201cyour side\u201d, and we will never sit together. The Swedish parliament is built as an amphitheatre so everyone is in the round and they sit in the alphabetical order of their constituency. The randomised seating is designed to enforce collaboration between parties. In the House of Commons, the building itself will not allow for that.\n\nAs a panellist on Question Time last week you said that theatres were not going to reopen any time soon. Do you think they will look and feel the same when they do?\n\nIt\u2019s hard to know but an important question to ask is whether they should look the same. I think we should celebrate the past few years, which, through the relentless campaigning of grassroots people and organisations as well as the backing of leaders, have opened up theatre to make it more diverse and get as many representative voices on stage. It isn\u2019t perfect but positive progress is being made. In the difficult climate that theatre is in now, we have to hold on to asking big questions: how do we reset? Who are we resetting for? How can we speed up access to theatre and the arts for everyone?\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Tick tock \u2026 Phil Daniels in This House by James Graham at the Garrick theatre.

No one denies Lenny Bruce\u2019s significance: he\u2019s listed third among Rolling Stone\u2019s greatest ever comics \u2013 while acts one and two (George Carlin and Richard Pryor) pegged him as their biggest influence. But does anyone listen to him any more? And is he still funny? The US standup Patton Oswalt wrote on the 50th anniversary of Bruce\u2019s death that any comics claiming to find him funny were lying. Four years on, we have another opportunity to investigate with the official release of Lenny Bruce is Out Again.\n\nIt won\u2019t change the conversation; Oswalt will not be clutching his aching sides. The fact that Bruce pressed the disc himself for sale at his gigs is evident: there\u2019s no introduction, the tracks are spliced crudely and in no coherent sequence, the sound quality isn\u2019t great. Nor do the recordings deliver standup fully formed \u2013 if that means punchlines and well-crafted jokes. Bruce part-improvised his shows, flitting between sketch, monologue and free association. Standup as a truth-telling art form may emerge from this brew. But these are just the first steps.\n\nThen there\u2019s the fact that, frankly, it\u2019s not always clear what Bruce is on about. That\u2019s partly because we\u2019re listening, 60 years later, to a standup who mainlined the culture of his day (among other substances). It\u2019s also because he speaks fast, in a chewy New York Jewish accent, in a jazzy rhythm \u2013 a hepcat jive that made him America\u2019s most exciting comedian as the 60s dawned.\n\nJerry Seinfeld: 23 Hours to Kill review \u2013 sublime standup from Mr Generic Read more\n\nThe sense that something electrifying is happening in the room sustains the show. Bruce\u2019s smirk is audible as he zeroes in on this or that taboo. Of course, we know that this is the only comedian ever jailed for his words (in America, at least). But listening to Out Again, you can hear why he wound people up. This is the sound of distilled provocation. His country\u2019s hypocrisies on race, religion and obscenity were scabs Bruce couldn\u2019t help picking at. You hear a voice that wants to make something bleed.\n\nSome celebrated routines feature. \u201cTo is a preposition, come is a verb\u201d would be an extraordinary skit even now, a needling spoken-word incantation \u2013 like Ivor Cutler gone bad; or Hans Teeuwen at his tawdriest \u2013 prising back the language and experience of orgasm from the smothering of polite silence. Something similar is at play with \u201cIs there a n***** in the room?\u201d It\u2019s not a word we want to hear a white comedian bandying about now, yet it\u2019s still possible to admire this uncomfortable routine in which gleeful repetition takes the sting out of racial epithets \u2013 those against Bruce\u2019s identity as well as others\u2019.\n\nBut admiration isn\u2019t amusement. I suspect we\u2019d all be laughing more if we were back there in the room with him. Poor-quality audio only takes you so far. But even then \u2013 with apologies to Oswalt \u2013 I found myself laughing at several tracks here. Like when Bruce mocks the phrase \u201cdirty toilet humour\u201d by saddling toilets with characteristics other than dirty (\u201cIt could be a communist toilet\u201d) or wonders whether \u201ctits and ass\u201d shows in Vegas would be more acceptable if billed \u201cgluteus maximus and pectoralis majors nightly!\u201d\n\nOut Again isn\u2019t just a primary source for historians of countercultural comedy, it raises a smile too.", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/may/25/lenny-bruce-is-out-again-review", "published": "2020-05-25T00:00:00", "author": ["Brian Logan"]}, {"title": "My favourite film aged 12: Diva", "text": "The stylish French thriller was less of an art film than it looked, but I was hooked by its mix of operatic Parisian settings, elegant menace and moped daredevilry\n\nFor this 12-year-old, Paris was a dream city where a dream me might idle days away at pavement cafes, talking about art that was very probably profound, finding out about girls and smoking hundreds of cigarettes. So seeing Diva when it arrived at our local rep cinema was perfect screen reverie.\n\nIts hero is the moon-faced young postman Jules (Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Andr\u00e9i), scooting around the arrondissements on a Mobylette while nursing a romantic obsession with the opera singer Cynthia Hawkins (Wilhelmenia Wiggins Fernandez), who is world famous for forbidding any recordings. (He doesn\u2019t deliver much post, and how she pulled her stardom off without putting out any records remains mysterious.)\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Deep bath \u2026 Gorodish (Richard Bohringer). Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/Alamy\n\nThe scene is set as Hawkins performs an aria from La Wally by Alfredo Catalani to a packed house, alone on a huge stage at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Bouffes du Nord. (Fernandez is a singer in real life, and even if you\u2019re 12 and don\u2019t like opera it really is ravishing.) Jules sits anxiously in his seat, making a bootleg on a fancy tape recorder. And thereby begins an ambitiously pointless plot, adapted by Beineix from Daniel \u201cDelacorta\u201d Odier\u2019s eponymous thriller.\n\nFor Jules is being watched by two characters worryingly unashamed to wear mirror shades to the Bouffes. (How else to keep your profile low at the opera?) Having stolen Hawkins\u2019s soul, Jules joins the backstage crush of bouquets, and steals her flowing blue performance gown, usefully abandoned in the dressing room. Back home, in a vast loft over an unexplained \u201cgraveyard\u201d of mangled classic cars, he wraps himself in the enchanted dress and hits play, even moonier-faced.\n\nBack on the Mobylette next morning, idling outside one of the gares, Jules crosses paths with a desperate young woman who has arrived in Paris with a cassette incriminating the ringleader of a prostitution ring. It\u2019s early in the film so naturally a pair of henchmen are in wait. One of them, a malevolent goblin known as the Cur\u00e9 \u2013 an unforgettable Dominique Pinon \u2013 dispatches her with an icepick. But not before she\u2019s slipped the cassette into Jules\u2019s pannier.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Fast friends \u2026 Thuy An Luu and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Andr\u00e9i.

The latter looks uncomfortably pimpy when viewed with adult eyes, but seemed very cool then, talking nonsense about Zen baguettes in his still vaster loft. He even throws in some existential blather in Latin. Deep.\n\nGorodish has another, even bigger and moodier bolthole that provides a second escape hatch for Jules. Self-reference was still fashionable in 1982, and in the latter retreat Jules asks Alba where they are. In a castle, she says, \u201cwhere the witch makes poisoned red apples to advertise the toothpaste movie stars use\u201d. I know, I know, but there\u2019s other stuff to like; and where the film looks tired now, it\u2019s often because marketing folk have picked it over for shopping purposes. The soundtrack, for instance, will feel very familiar even if you haven\u2019t seen the film.\n\nPauline Kael reviewed the film enthusiastically for the New Yorker, declaring it \u201ca glittering toy of a movie\u201d, and indeed the whole film is more or less a MacGuffin. It never seems particularly concerned with the criminal world Jules has strayed into, except as a premise for a series of grand set-piece shootouts; or with the parallel soul-stealing it sets up. But however empty it is, all this scene-setting remains enough to keep a boy beguiled. And it also has an absolutely glorious Mobylette chase through the M\u00e9tro, complete with juddering, nouvelle-vague-ish camera work.\n\nAs I didn\u2019t realise then, it\u2019s a shamelessly superficial picture. But it did superficiality so well that it helped set off something like a movement in French cinema \u2013 le cin\u00e9ma du look as it was christened.

Suddenly we\u2019re all poring over reams of data, while debates over the merits of mathematical models are front page news. But while some are flexing new-found expertise in logarithmic axes and inflection points, those of us who have been in the game a bit longer flinch at this new epidemic of brash certainty. We know the traps that are easy to fall into when you let numbers be your guide.\n\nOne graph that made me roll my eyes compared per capita death rates for the UK, the EU, China and the US.

This is the book I tell everyone to read. It\u2019s about the unavoidable limits of what numbers can tell you. Data and modelling will only ever get you half way there. Ultimately, someone has to weigh up the evidence and choose the path to follow.\n\nUsing mathematical models to understand the world is like squishing a round peg into a square hole. Most of the hole gets filled, but there will always be edges and corners where the maths doesn\u2019t quite reach. As Cathy O\u2019Neil explains in Weapons of Math Destruction, these forgotten margins can cause profound problems. This cautionary tale offers valuable lessons about the risks of social injustice when we put flawed mathematical models in positions of power.\n\nAnd yet, in a battle with nature where so much is unknown, maths really is one of the few weapons on our side. \u201cNumbers may not be able to speak for themselves,\u201d as Nate Silver puts it in The Signal and the Noise, but it\u2019s important not to dismiss them altogether. Silver\u2019s book underlines the great power of mathematical models, showing how effectively they can be deployed to tentatively explore the possible futures that lie ahead.\n\nAdam Kucharski, who is fast becoming a key voice of reason in the media circus surrounding the virus, examines the models we\u2019re currently using to chart the course of the infection in The Rules of Contagion. Here he gives a clear, calm, historical overview of the mathematical ideas at the forefront of our pandemic response, where they came from and how well they stand up when you put them to the test.\n\nIf the history of mathematical modelling seems a little daunting right now, then you could always turn to its future \u2013 at least a possible future imagined by Isaac Asimov\u2019s Foundation series. The books date back to the 1940s and 50s (the golden era of science fiction) but his ideas are eerily prescient. They follow the story of Hari Seldon, a mathematician who invents a discipline called psychohistory: a way to use maths to peer into the future and predict the likely behaviour of large groups of people. He tries to use his equations to save civilisation, but finds himself trapped by political forces seeking to use the science for their own ends.

She wrote repeatedly of feeling terribly alone and \u201cso frightened\u201d. Such was her despair that she referred to a bruised shoulder as \u201ca kind of company\u201d.\n\nHer heart-wrenching thoughts are contained in 54 boxes filled with 2,400 letters to Larkin that she left to the Bodleian Library, Oxford, with the strict instruction that they were to remain closed until decades after her death. She died in 2001, aged 78.\n\nNow Professor John Sutherland, a leading scholar and Jones\u2019s close friend, has been given unrestricted access to the extraordinary collection.\n\nHe told the Observer that the letters were \u201cexplosive in their nature\u201d, and represented \u201cvirtually everything that she wrote to Larkin over 37 years of separated love\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Philip Larkin and Monica Jones at the memorial service for Poet Laureate Sir John Betjeman at Westminster Abbey, London, in 1984. Photograph: Getty Images\n\nDescribing it as \u201cthe last great exchange of letters in literary history\u201d, he said it was \u201clike she\u2019s ripping open her soul and her mind, letting it pour out. There\u2019s a whole range of emotions. Sometimes she is furious when he doesn\u2019t turn up for a meal she\u2019s cooked. Other times, she\u2019s just meditative.\u201d She wrote of her emptiness: \u201cEvery smallest thing is too much for me.\u201d\n\nLarkin and Jones were both born in 1922 and studied at Oxford, although they first met at the then University College Leicester in 1946. He was a newly appointed deputy librarian and she was an English lecturer, a striking woman with peroxide hair. Larkin transferred to Queen\u2019s University Belfast in 1950 and then five years later to the University of Hull. Jones lived for his visits. Their once-passionate relationship, blighted by their heavy drinking, lasted until his death in 1985.\n\nSutherland said: \u201cLarkin had two women in Hull [one of whom was Maeve Brennan]. He would fit Monica in when he was visiting his mother up the road [in Loughborough] \u2026 Then he\u2019d be back to Hull and the other women.\u201d\n\nJones knew of those women, yet she repeatedly declared her love for Larkin in her letters: \u201cI am so blessed to have you in my life.\u201d\n\nSutherland said: \u201cHer letters resemble a literary stream of consciousness \u2013 at times, more surging flood than stream. They have odd disjunctions. After a pages-long savage diatribe against Maeve, Monica suddenly reminds Philip to water the flowers.\u201d\n\nLarkin appreciated Jones as his intellectual equal, unlike his other women. He dedicated his breakthrough collection, The Less Deceived, to her \u2013 though it includes poems about his other partnerships. He bequeathed the bulk of his estate to her.\n\nBut the fact that he wrote so little poetry has been blamed on the stultifying effect of Jones, Sutherland said: \u201cHis poetry depends on four slim volumes \u2026 Around 100 poems.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Monica Jones photographed by Larkin on the Isle of Mull, Scotland, 1971. Photograph: The estate of Philip Larkin\n\nHe noted that Kingsley Amis, Larkin\u2019s closest friend from Oxford, was particularly vicious, dismissing her as a \u201cgrim old bag\u201d.\n\n\u201cMargaret Peel in [Amis\u2019s novel] Lucky Jim is a terrible caricature of Monica. Kingsley hadn\u2019t met her at that point. Philip gave Kingsley all the details. He could be cruel in that way. She wrote an incredibly impassioned letter to Philip saying, \u2018I am not so egotistical as to think everybody wants to put me in a book and I do not believe you would be so treacherous\u2019.\u201d\n\nJones has also been vilified for destroying 30 volumes of his diaries and private papers.\n\nSutherland, professor emeritus of modern English literature at University College London, was taught by Jones, and he attributes his career to her. He is now finishing a book on Jones, based on the letters, to be published next year by Weidenfeld & Nicolson. He expressed surprise that no one had written a biography of her before as she was the most important person in Larkin\u2019s life.\n\nHe said no other biographer of Larkin had \u201cenjoyed access to these letters\u201d, which the Bodleian has catalogued in a \u201cfeat of librarianship at the highest level\u201d. Poignantly, some of the envelopes still bear her lipstick marks.\n\nThe correspondence ends in the early 1970s when they got telephones. Sutherland said: \u201cAfter that, he would telephone every night. When her health collapsed in the early 1980s, she moved in with him. They got drunk together. He died and she lived on drunkenly.\n\n\u201cShe was a strange woman. You had to know her, to know the good things about her. He treated her badly, but always wrote fondly. It was an odd mixture \u2026 He did come near to trying to break up with her, but they needed each other. They were both very unhappy people.\u201d\n\nSutherland hopes \u201cto salvage Monica Jones from the versions of Monica Jones which circulated in her life and still circulate\u201d. \u201cFrom the unplumbed depths of the 54 boxes, one can exhume a Monica Jones to stand alongside Philip Larkin, not behind him as his dim correspondent shadow.\u201d", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/may/24/sex-lies-and-despair-unseen-letters-reveal-larkins-tortured-love", "published": "2020-05-24T00:00:00", "author": ["Dalya Alberge"]}, {"title": "How to conduct a remote interview: seven tips for schools hiring teachers", "text": "Make sure you choose a quiet space to conduct an online interview. Photograph: filadendron/Getty Images\n\nAs a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, more schools than ever are recruiting new teachers online. How can you prepare effectively to make the most of the remote interview process? This handy seven-point guide will help you keep in mind the questions you should be asking any potential new members of your staffroom. The teachers on your candidate shortlist might know their ABCs from their hypotenuses \u2013 but what do you need to do to get the best out of them in a remote interview?\n\n1. Prepare your questions \u2013 and answers\n\nAn online interview is like any other \u2013 make sure you\u2019ve set your interview agenda. If you\u2019re interviewing with another member of staff make sure you\u2019ve decided who will ask what questions \u2013 and also, who will answer any questions from your candidates. Key questions you should be prepared to answer would include: What makes the school unique? What does the school need to improve? Does the school provide personalised, professional development? How would pupils, parents and other teachers describe your school? And be prepared to include a range of pupils and teachers in the recruitment process. Those who do this now should find themselves ahead of the recruitment process.\n\n2. Find a quiet space\n\nWhen you\u2019re conducting the interview make sure you\u2019re in a quiet space, with a background that is tidy and clear. It\u2019s also worth considering how you position your microphone and camera lens so that you can present yourself from the waist upwards. Simple stuff I know, but you\u2019d be surprised how many do not consider camera angle and lighting positioning. It could make the difference in a successful appointment!\n\n3. Ensure your technology is up to date\n\nIt\u2019s worth making sure your browser is running the latest updates and that you\u2019ve got a reliable broadband connection. Check both camera and microphone are working with your fellow teachers before you are on an interview video call. It\u2019s worth giving candidates details of the technology you use in advance of your interview, so they have time to familiarise themselves with the differences between Zoom, Skype, Google Hangouts or Microsoft Teams.\n\n4. Prepare to multitask\n\nLearn how to speak to the camera lens, make notes as well as use the video technology to navigate between your camera, the screen and the microphone. When you are not speaking, for example, you may wish to mute your microphone so that the interviewee does not hear any distracting background noises. If you take time to rehearse, this will also help schools make better appointments today rather than after discovering where and how the technology lets you down.\n\n5. Offer to let candidates speak to colleagues\n\nOnce you have set the interview agenda it can be helpful to arrange for an informal meeting with colleagues already working at the school. Select a range of teachers who best represent your school, to show your potential as a good employer. For example, a member of the support staff, the school receptionist, a member of staff who has just joined the school and a member of staff who is leaving the school. You\u2019re looking to give an indication of the school\u2019s culture. This may be difficult to achieve remotely, but it\u2019s not impossible. Plan to have this in place, now.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Try and involve pupils, either with a pupil interview or an online lesson. Photograph: Richard Drury/Getty Images\n\n6. Offer a pupil interview if possible\n\nTechnology may also be able to offer the capacity for a pupil interview experience, or perhaps even an online lesson for the candidates to teach with the panel observing as part of the application process. If you are able to provide the opportunity for candidates to teach a lesson online, it\u2019s critical to offer as much information about the lesson and the children for it to be an effective exercise. Of course, during a pandemic, going about teaching online will be immensely different from teaching face-to-face: watch to see how teachers engage the pupils in a virtual classroom. How do candidates communicate effectively through a camera lens? Can they question, hold to account, and provide feedback to pupils online?\n\nThe new rules of remote recruiting: how to prepare for an online interview Read more\n\n7. Can you offer a virtual tour?\n\nOne of the key opportunities at interview is a tour of the school. Doing this remotely presents a significant challenge, but again, those innovative school leaders will already be working ahead of the bell curve. Beyond the school website, most schools will have a range of images of events taking place on site, with photo galleries and online videos. It\u2019s worth making sure your school\u2019s social media strategy shares positive news stories with the general public, as well as pupils and parents, and prospective teachers. With most schools open during Covid-19 in a limited capacity, there will be an option for school leadership teams who are currently on-site to provide applicants with a virtual tour of the school facilities, classrooms and office spaces. This will allow potential candidates to ask questions or gain a perception of potential employment opportunities.\n\nAppointing teachers during a pandemic is difficult, but it\u2019s not impossible. To ensure your school isn\u2019t missing key appointments when all schools resume full service, it is critical that your school considers remote recruitment ideas now.\n\nIf you are currently recruiting for your schools please contact us by going to recruiters.theguardian.com and if you are seeking a new role at a school please visit our jobsite", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/the-abcs-of-recruiting-teachers-remotely/2020/may/01/how-to-conduct-a-remote-interview-seven-tips-for-schools-hiring-teachers", "published": "2020-05-01T00:00:00", "author": ["Ross Morrison Mcgill"]}, {"title": "The new rules of remote recruiting: how to prepare for an online interview", "text": "Recruiters say that both the interviewer and candidate should treat a remote interview like a traditional face-to-face interview.

Nor is the use of technology in the recruitment process, with an influx of artificial-intelligence tools that source and screen candidates hitting the market in recent years. There are algorithms that can analyse candidates\u2019 tone of voice, facial expressions, and speech patterns during video pre-assessments, scoring them against an ideal profile for that role. Graduates have reportedly spent thousands of pounds learning how to beat these systems.\n\nBut for many companies, still recruiting during the global Covid-19 lockdown, moving the process online can be a daunting prospect. Stone recommends all involved \u2013 recruiter and candidate \u2013 treat a remote interview like a traditional, face-to-face meeting as much as possible. \u201cGet up, get showered, put a suit on,\u201d he says. \u201cPay consideration to what can be seen on that camera behind you. Make sure you\u2019ve got an hour\u2019s worth of peace and quiet.\u201d Some candidates may be more nervous appearing on video than they would be in person, he adds. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to try and get past that. Build rapport, put them at their ease, get them talking about subjects they\u2019re comfortable talking about so they relax.\u201d\n\nEllie Wilson, the co-founder and operations director of Virtalent, has run hundreds of remote interviews since launching her virtual assistant service six years ago. She\u2019s found the recruitment process much more efficient when it\u2019s all online. \u201cWe can go from someone submitting an assessment to having the final interview and running background checks almost within 48 hours,\u201d she says. \u201cI certainly don\u2019t think you lose anything just because you can\u2019t shake that person\u2019s hand.

She recommends interviewees also do a practice run-through with friends or family: \u201cThink about making sure your personality comes out. So if you\u2019re going for a job that needs a motivated self-starter, that\u2019s what you\u2019ve got to be when you\u2019re on camera.\u201d Candidates interviewed by video also have the luxury of being able to use printouts of the job description and any other reference notes without the interviewer\u2019s knowledge.\n\nLooking to teach at a new school?

Photograph: damircudic/Getty Images\n\nIf you are a teacher looking to move between schools during the coronavirus lockdown, how can you make the most of the online education experience with your new class? This is interesting new territory for many teachers. But there are thousands and thousands of teachers and pupils already learning remotely, in virtual schools \u2013 can they offer insights?\n\nAt a virtual school, lessons are delivered in line with each person\u2019s personalised curriculum. Exactly as you would expect in a physical school space, pupils are taught how to interact with teachers, their peers and lesson content using whiteboard technology, quizzes, voice and video as well as receiving and sending assignment tasks. How should you introduce yourself to a new class, if you are meeting them online for the first time? If we consider how teachers deliver excellent classroom teaching practice in a physical space, how they prepare should not be approached any differently in an online environment.\n\nFlipped learning\n\n\u201cFlipped learning\u201d is a term used to describe how teachers can provide material for pupils to learn outside of the classroom. Although this is traditionally considered homework or coursework and typically completed without the teacher, increasingly this approach to enhance learning outside of the classroom has been set and completed online. During lockdown, teachers will be focusing on core curriculum content, meeting the needs of vulnerable pupils as well as enhancing student engagement, mixing between activities, types of assignments and differentiation techniques to support a range of pupils. One factor that must be considered for teachers who are working remotely, is how they can mix online teaching and learning with traditional methods that would be used in the physical classroom. A good tip for teachers working online, especially from home, is to have a simple whiteboard behind the camera and teach just as you would in a physical classroom space. Doing this over a sustained period of time will definitely present a new challenge, but it\u2019s possible with well-thought-out curriculum plans, and a simple range of equipment.\n\nBlended learning\n\nBlended learning, first developed in the 1960s, was a method of instruction using technology-mediated methods. With flipped learning being the norm during lockdown, what can teachers learn from other educators who are already working in blended learning environments \u2013 teachers working in virtual schools, or online tutors?\n\nIf we look towards Barak Rosenshine\u2019s 17 recommendations for effective teaching, these can quite easily be reapplied to online teaching, delivered through (at least) video conferencing. At the start of every lesson, review the last lesson with a simple retrieval exercise. This supports long-term retention, can easily be deployed with a simple quiz or competition and is a guaranteed way to get a lesson off to a flying start.\n\nWhen presenting new material, successful teachers teach by giving a series of short presentations using many examples. Teachers should also provide guided practice by modelling various techniques. Where teachers present too much material at once, this will confuse pupils. Working online without sufficient verbal and non-verbal cues, means it will be critical for teachers to regularly check student responses.\n\nOne way that teachers can do this is to ask a large number of questions. Feedback can be provided by giving prompts, modelling and guiding pupils as they develop independent practice and asking simple questions such as \u201cwho, where, why and how\u201d to help shape pupils\u2019 thinking. When teachers check frequently to see if all students are learning, this processes information into long-term memory, developing schematic concepts to support retention. Teaching remotely, whether using Microsoft Teams, Google Suite or other platforms, gives teachers a significant array of strategies to deploy at this interesting time.\n\nFinally, research recommends that teachers should try \u201cscaffold learning\u201d, helping pupils to problem-solve by thinking out loud and providing cognitive support. This can be achieved by completing the work alongside pupils; doing this online may require teachers to use \u201cbreakout spaces\u201d by waiting to provide individual feedback in live video conferencing lessons.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Teachers delivering lessons from home should have a simple whiteboard behind them and teach just as they would in a physical classroom. Photograph: Jovanmandic/Getty Images/iStockphoto\n\nFlexibility and personalisation\n\nEvery student should be treated as an individual online as all teachers would in a physical space, and with teachers working remotely, they will need to learn how to use technology as well as adapt content to meet individual needs. If you are meeting your pupils for the first time, I would recommend sending them a survey, asking them to complete simple questions so that you can elicit initial information about their interests, abilities and hopes. You can then start to plan which interventions you will use in your lesson planning and delivery.\n\nTo help support increased teacher workload, my key recommendation would be that if teachers are able to connect with the pupils online, it is important to allow students to engage in a weekly and monthly review of their learning to support long-term memory. Often this manifests itself when a pupil says: \u201cWe\u2019ve done this before!\u201d But effective teachers will remind pupils that this is a retrieval practice exercise to assist with long-term retention.\n\nSafeguarding and security\n\nIf you are joining a virtual school, then I would assume the various safeguarding procedures are already in place. However, if you now find yourself teaching pupils online for the first time, having never met them physically, you should double-check to ensure that your new school has considered data protection, child protection, internet security and the various online safeguarding procedures for teachers and pupils.\n\nHow to conduct a remote interview: seven tips for schools hiring teachers Read more\n\nWhen teaching from your own home environment, it is worth reflecting on your own safeguarding procedures. For example, if you have not yet physically reached your new school, have you received any induction, or has the designated safeguarding officer spoken with you about induction procedures? Of the students in your register, which have specific learning needs that require initial conversations with your special needs coordinator or associated form tutors? All these balances and checks would be done physically on entry to a new school; just because you are doing this remotely, doesn\u2019t mean that they should not happen.\n\nCreating a supportive, online environment\n\nWhat should teachers consider when meeting their pupils online? Many schools will assign home-learning tasks through software or an online curriculum portal, which parents can access. Other schools will have their teachers and pupils log on to a secure platform, to complete assignments, submit work and interact with the teacher through voice or text. Some schools will be offering live video lessons with pupils, teaching from the home environment or from their school classrooms.\n\nIf we look towards countries such as South Korea and Singapore, where teachers have an almost celebrity-like online presence, it\u2019s common to find them sharing videos, teaching lessons through YouTube or having millions of viewers on Instagram.\n\nIf you are currently recruiting for your schools please contact us by going to recruiters.theguardian.com and if you are seeking a new role at a school please visit our jobsite", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/the-abcs-of-recruiting-teachers-remotely/2020/may/01/teacher-training-how-do-you-prepare-to-teach-a-new-class-during-lockdown", "published": "2020-05-01T00:00:00", "author": ["Ross Morrison Mcgill"]}, {"title": "Looking to teach at a new school? Here\u2019s how to find the one that\u2019s right for you", "text": "Be prepared for an online interview, and if using unfamiliar software, practice with a friend first.\n\nPhotograph: Luis Alvarez/Getty Images\n\nWhether it\u2019s your first job after teacher training or you\u2019re an experienced hand, evaluating a potential school is a crucial part of the interview process. But how do you do that remotely? Here are top tips for teachers applying to work at a new school under lockdown.\n\nPrepare for remote interviews\n\nAlthough the coronavirus pandemic presents us with many challenges, it\u2019s worth remembering that schools and supply agencies have been recruiting teachers online for almost 20 years. Independent and English language international schools are increasingly recruiting teachers via video to work with them overseas. The current lockdown has forced all schools across the UK to reconsider how they recruit teachers.\n\nBe tech-ready\n\nOn both sides of the camera it is critical to check the video technology, the microphone and your background environment when conducting an interview via video. What apps will they be using? Have you used them before? If not, rehearse with a friend.\n\nThink the process through\n\nIt is crucial to find a school which best meets your needs. Find as many schools as possible before you begin any application process. This will give you motivation, as well as building up a network for future job opportunities.\n\nVisit the school \u2013 virtually\n\nIn order to determine which type of environment you feel most comfortable with, one important planning aspect to consider is your journey to and from the school, should you be successfully appointed. Under normal circumstances it\u2019s worth considering a trial journey during peak commuter hours to see if the journey is manageable. Under the current conditions, it\u2019s worth trying to arrange for a virtual tour of the school site \u2013 just as you would for a position that involves relocating to the other side of the country, or an international job. A conscientious school leader should be more than happy to take candidates on a video tour. This is even more critical during lockdown when all schools are struggling with recruitment.\n\nPrepare your application\n\nLook at the key facts listed on the job advert, and evaluate how they match up with the person specification \u2013 not the job description. Think carefully about what you can offer the school. Initial research on examination performance, pupil demographics and inspection reports will help you identify key priorities in the application. It would also be wise to consider why you want to work at the school. For more on this, see the five-minute interview plan. Regarding referees and references, it is always worth asking permission and giving those key people a \u201cheads-up\u201d. References are frequently requested with limited time for the referee to respond, putting them under pressure. You don\u2019t want to put your job application in jeopardy!\n\nSubmitting your application\n\nSpellcheck, spellcheck, spellcheck! Whatever you do, do not copy and paste bog-standard educational cliches and fire off application after application without due diligence. I\u2019ve seen thousands of applications thrown in the bin because they accidentally mention another school\u2019s name, have grammatical errors or include inappropriate information (no one needs to know your astrological birth sign!). Ask a friend to proofread your application. Show the reader that you have conducted some research, posing questions and thoughts, as well as some solutions with evidence of things that you have contributed towards in your current role. Remember, you can discuss finer details during the interview, so keep the facts concise.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Ask direct questions to make sure the school\u2019s right for you. Photograph: Westend61/Getty Images\n\nPlan your questions\n\nThe easiest way to discover if a school leadership team is on track is to ask direct questions at the interview. For example: \u201cHow many teachers left your school last year?\u201d \u201cHow much of the overall budget does the school protect for professional development?\u2019\u2019 \u201cWhy should I work at your school?\u201d \u201cIs the school budget in deficit, if so by how much?\u201d If these questions are avoided, it\u2019s a good indication that this might not be the school for you.\n\nNail that interview!\n\nBe prepared, rehearse potential questions and answers, pick out what you will wear on the day \u2013 even for an online interview. Show interest and be conscientious by keeping your questions and answers concise. Whatever you do, do not be late: in an online interview, there really are no traffic excuses.\n\nTeacher training: how do you prepare to teach a new class during lockdown? Read more\n\nHave your answers ready\n\nBe prepared to answer a range of challenging questions, and rehearse a variety of scenarios where you can provide concise answers. What would colleagues say about you? What area of the teaching standards do you most need to work on? What has been the greatest challenge in your career to date? Where do you want to be in three years\u2019 time? Why do you want to work in this school? When it comes to \u201cawkward\u201d questions, they can often be a test of how professional and measured you will be in your response, rather than the answer itself.\n\n\n\nFinal questions\n\nFinally, asking questions at the end of an interview, always have two or three questions prepared. Whatever you do, make sure you ask them. It shows the interview panel that you are prepared, interested and it is your one opportunity to put them on the spot and turn the tables in the process.\n\nIf you are currently recruiting for your schools please contact us by going to recruiters.theguardian.com and if you are seeking a new role at a school please visit our jobsite", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/the-abcs-of-recruiting-teachers-remotely/2020/may/01/looking-to-teach-at-a-new-school-heres-how-to-find-the-one-thats-right-for-you", "published": "2020-05-01T00:00:00", "author": ["Ross Morrison Mcgill"]}, {"title": "Shopping habits of generation Z could spell end of fast fashion", "text": "W\n\nith the high street and the fashion industry brought to its knees by the coronavirus pandemic, the \u2018buy less, buy better\u2019 ideology of generation Z \u2013 those aged 18 to 24 \u2013 could see the beginning of the end of fast fashion, new research suggests.\n\nIf generation Z\u2019s habits are adopted by the population as a whole there could be a shift to consumers with a \u201cdivided wardrobe\u201d \u2013 featuring rented items and others bought from resale vendors \u2013 becoming the new normal.\n\nThe research, carried out on behalf of the Royal Society for the encouragement of Arts, Manufacturers and Commerce (RSA) found from polling that during the pandemic, 28% of people are recycling or reusing more clothes than normal and 35% of women intend to buy fewer clothes in the future. The RSA is calling on the government to invest in sustainable fashion and manufacturers to be more responsible, following the research.\n\nThe RSA are also asking for enforced standards around how durable clothes are, plus a push towards a more circular localised economy within fashion.\n\nThis emphasis on sustainability, non mass-produced goods and uniqueness mirrors the consumer values of the younger generation whose attitude towards fashion has been shaped by the \u201cBlue Planet effect\u201d.\n\n\u201cGeneration Z is discerning,\u201d says Jeff Froom, co-author of Marketing to Gen Z. \u201c[They\u2019ve] grown up with more access to information from more sources than ever before. Inequality, climate change and LGBTQ+ rights are topics they\u2019ve heard about for years.\u201d\n\nKati Chitrakorn, retail and marketing editor at Vogue Business, said: \u201cFor today\u2019s kids fashion is less about fitting in and more about making choices that reflect their own identity.\u201d\n\nBefore the pandemic two-thirds of clothing was purchased in stores, but the 18+ group had already found alternatives to bricks and mortar (their sophisticated modes of consumption often outpacing what the high street could offer) shopping through online resale sites such as Poshmark, Grailed, Vestiaire Collective and clothing rental sites, all of which have seen a sales boost during lockdown. \u201cBeing able to \u2018do something\u2019 \u2013 upcycling, customising or reusing rather than discarding \u2013 lets younger people feel like they\u2019re part of a movement,\u201d says Chitrakorn \u201cand that mindset has been popular even prior to the pandemic.\u201d\n\n\u201cYoung, values-oriented [shoppers] are looking for more responsible ways to consume,\u201d explains Ceanne Fernandes-Wong, CEO of COCOON a luxury handbag rental service. \u201cThe pandemic has amplified this. More and more consumers will be comfortable with variety in their consumption choices - from buying new to circular options including rental and resale. A \u2018divided wardrobe\u2019 is inevitable.\u201d\n\nSonia Lapinsky of retail consultants AlixPartners said: \u201cRental will continue to expand, given consumer sustainability consciousness and a reset in consumerism. We have all made do with a lot less for many weeks \u2013 enough to form new habits.\u201d\n\nDepop \u2013 a peer-to-peer shopping app that allows shoppers to buy secondhand items from each other \u2013 has seen a 90% increase in traffic since 1 April. In contrast, retail sales fell by a record 18.1% in the same month. \u201cGeneration Z want individuality and to reduce waste, Depop allows them to do both,\u201d said a spokeswoman for the company.\n\n\u201cWe definitely believe that this unique moment will encourage people to reconsider resale as an alternative to shopping \u2018new\u2019,\u201d she says. \u201cOur community has access to a vast inventory of pre-loved streetwear, vintage designer, one-of-a-kind creations and more that allows them to build their own identity and create their own story all as a sustainable choice. They have the financial incentive to buy and sell garments, rather than leaving them unused in a wardrobe or sending them to a landfill.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s not that simple. With retailers still working out what a re-opened store would look like (socially distanced shoppers in store, sales assistants behind plexiglass, compulsory masks, the question of changing rooms), post-corona resale and rental outfits will have the same issues. \u201cAre they communicative and transparent regarding product handling processes and cleanliness?,\u201d asks Lapinsky \u201cIf not, the consumer will likely remain skittish to pre-used garments and accessories.\u201d However, e-commerce is still considered by many to be the safest way of shopping.\n\nThe future of fashion and retail is under debate. The RSA\u2019s calls follow similar requests from fashion bodies calling for social and environmental sustainability.\n\nOn Thursday, the British Fashion Council and the Council of Fashion Designers of America released a statement requesting a reduction in the number of seasonal collections, clothes produced and travel. The sentiment was echoed in an open letter from designers and retailers led by Dries Van Noten that appeared early last week.", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2020/may/25/shopping-habits-of-generation-z-could-spell-end-of-fast-fashion", "published": "2020-05-25T00:00:00", "author": ["Priya Elan"]}, {"title": "There's a fighter jet on the pavement!

Meanwhile, on the Baltic coast of Kaliningrad, a crumbling mermaid with a faded smile hovers above a swirling expressionist sign welcoming people to the seaside town of Yantarny.\n\nThese are just some of the curious fragments gathered from the farthest-flung corners of the former USSR, brought together in a new book, Soviet Signs and Street Relics. It is the latest volume from Fuel \u2013 publishers of such classics as Soviet Bus Stops and Russian Criminal Tattoos \u2013 and it\u2019s a fitting travelogue for our constrained times. Unlike these previous surveys of communist relics, photographed in the flesh, these have been collected via Google Street View.\n\nFrench photographer Jason Guilbeau spent months travelling thousands of miles, from Vladivostok to the Baltic Sea, all from the comfort of his computer, searching for strange roadside remains of the Soviet empire. The results are a haunting mix of forlorn military symbols, creaking monuments to agricultural prowess, and plenty of space-age swooshes, swirls, stars and arrows pointing towards a bold utopian future that never quite arrived.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Washed up \u2026 a ship teeters on the crest of a concrete wave in Novorossiysk. Photograph: Jason Guilbeau\n\nIn the introduction, architectural historian Clem Cecil describes how the road network in the Soviet Union assumed a huge significance, as the population was urged to be peripatetic. Young couples were offered jobs the length and breadth of the country, far from their original homes, while others were encouraged to be pioneer settlers in new regions. The roadside monuments served as a continuous backdrop to the endless journey, reinforcing the messages of Soviet ideals and victories. \u201cLike bystanders cheering on marathon runners,\u201d Cecil writes, \u201croadside propaganda was there to work as a morale booster in the exhausting collective endeavour.\u201d\n\n\n\nTransport is a recurring subject for the sculptures, with cars, trains, boats and planes joined by tractors, pickup trucks and \u2013 later \u2013 dazzling space rockets. The message is clear: the Soviets had conquered movement in its every form. A shining rocket rises from a field outside Lipetsk, captured in motion above a blue and yellow sunburst. The depiction of movement reaches an artistic climax in Dnipro, Ukraine, where the entire pavement is co-opted into the tableau, swerving dramatically away from the road, breaking through a line of trees, and rearing up to become the concrete vapour trail of a fighter jet, frozen in mid-takeoff.\n\n\n\nElsewhere, bathos is the order of the day. The final spread in the book shows a rusting steam engine sitting on a fat column in the middle of an overgrown cobbled plaza, opposite a trio of tractors in various states of disassembly, perched on raw concrete poles. They look like flotsam stranded after a flood, or the result of a student prank, the vehicles jacked up into unlikely spots from where they will never be retrieved.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Pole position \u2026 three tractors on the roadside in Slavuta, Ukraine. Photograph: Jason Guilbeau\n\nIt is possible to read, in their various states of decay, the breakneck speed at which these structures were often erected, as part of a mass propaganda campaign across the vast USSR, often replacing religious or tsarist monuments. Cecil quotes Russian historian Mikhail Yampolsky: \u201cThe point was to replace some monuments with others quickly, as if the emptiness created by the broken idols possessed some sort of destructive force that had to be subdued.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn turn, the broken state of most of these roadside structures could today be read as its own destructive force, a reminder of the failure of the Soviet project. Which poses the question: why haven\u2019t they been removed if they serve as painful souvenirs of the recent past? \u201cPerhaps these objects persist because of their invisibility,\u201d writes Cecil. \u201cNobody sees them any more.\u201d\n\nEqually, they might persist because they have become much-loved local landmarks. Who wouldn\u2019t be cheered by the sight of the big plump watermelon, freshly sliced open and proudly displayed, on the corner of a street in Kherson Oblast? What child would not be entranced by the gigantic lump of coal framed inside a big red starburst, celebrating the Sibirginski open-cast mine in Kemerovo?\n\n\n\nWhatever their fate in the real world, these relics will live on in the omniscient cloud of Google Street View, the roadside propaganda of the former communist empire mapped in minute detail by American big tech.", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/may/25/fighter-jet-pavement-soviet-roadside-revolution", "published": "2020-05-25T00:00:00", "author": ["Oliver Wainwright"]}, {"title": "Tree of the week: 'This fallen elm looks like a Man Ray nude'", "text": "Photographer Sandrine Joseph fell in love with this fallen elm tree on one of her daily walks around Hampstead Heath in north London.

Don\u2019t worry, no foul play involved.\n\nLike the friend who is able to impressively clear and coordinate everyone\u2019s iCal schedule for a weekend away, it\u2019s the dressing that brings everything together.\n\nAll you have to do is master a few simple dressings and know when to wheel them out. I\u2019ve found these four have served me well. There\u2019s no science or witchcraft to them and they mostly use ingredients you probably already have at home.\n\nWhen life gives you lemons make tom kha gai, and surface spray Read more\n\nThe \u2018throw me on everything\u2019 dressing\n\nJust like your favourite winter trenchcoat, this simple Italian dressing goes with everything.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s your classic part extra-virgin olive oil, part vinegar combination, and you probably already have this one in your repertoire. This one really is about going on your own Italian vinegar adventure, depending on your vegetables and mood. Balsamic vinegar is great for salads that have a salty cheese (feta, goat\u2019s cheese), tomato or fruit element (think grilled peaches or roasted pears). White-wine vinegar and red-wine vinegar can be used interchangeably; the red variety is slightly more pungent. Both work with leafy green salads and crunchy vegetables including fennel, cucumber and radish.\n\nExtra-virgin olive oil, generous splash\n\nVinegar, generous splash (your choice of balsamic, red-wine vinegar or white-wine vinegar)\n\nFor this one, generously coat salad with equal parts extra-virgin olive oil and vinegar, then season with salt and pepper. Taste as you go \u2013 if you like a more robust dressing, add an extra splash of olive oil; for more tangy, extra vinegar.\n\nThe slightly fancy dressing\n\nThis one is a riff on your classic French vinaigrette. It\u2019s a little tangy and a little bit sour.\n\nIt works well with bitter leafy greens, including rocket, endive and witlof. This is a good one if you\u2019re also going down the route of salad for dinner and having a tuna nicoise, as the dressing is non-offensive and works well with fish, green beans, eggs and potatoes.\n\n1 lemon, juiced\n\n2 tbsp Diijon mustard\n\n3 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil\n\n\u00bd tbsp apple cider vinegar\n\nSalt and pepper, to taste\n\nWhisk ingredients together or shake in a jar. Season with salt and pepper to taste.\n\nThe creamy, leftovers dressing\n\nOften the greatest kitchen victories are those when you open the fridge and declare \u201cthere\u2019s nothing to cook\u201d and then using your end-of-week dregs miraculously whip together an impressive anything-goes dish.\n\n\n\nFor me, the key ingredients for experiencing this success involve having tahini and yoghurt in the fridge and pouring this dressing over whatever rogue vegetables I\u2019ve found. I\u2019ll use this dressing over salads that incorporate a roasted vegetable element (such as eggplant, cauliflower, sprouts or broccoli) or chickpeas and kale.\n\n\u00bd juice of lemon\n\n2 tbsp tahini (preferably hulled)\n\n\u00bc cup Greek yoghurt\n\n2 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil\n\nSalt and pepper, to taste\n\nMix together and season to taste. Consistency should not be too thick or thin. Add extra olive oil if too thick, as it will help loosen the dressing and make it easier to coat everything in your salad.\n\nHoney pot: how to brew mead at home Read more\n\nThe sad-herb reviver dressing\n\nThis is one of the greatest kitchen waste hacks \u2013 it utilises those wilted herbs in the bottom of the crisper and turns them into a herby, garlicky green sauce you will want to pour over everything from salads to meat.\n\n\n\nThis version is a slight riff off one I learned from Alex Elliott-Howery of Sydney cafe Cornersmith, and as a salad dressing fiend I bow down to her every day for bringing this dressing into my life.

The first, The Cuisines of Mexico, was published in 1972, is several hundred pages long, and has been widely credited with introducing traditional Mexican cooking to the English-speaking world.\n\nKennedy is 97, white, and English \u2013 hardly the ingredients you\u2019d expect to make up a leading authority on Mexican food, but sometimes ingredients surprise you. She lives in the hills of Michoac\u00e1n, four hours west of Mexico City, on a piece of land she bought decades ago. In culinary circles she is adored. The Mexican chef Gabriela C\u00e1mara describes her as \u201ca legend\u201d. Here\u2019s the restaurateur Nick Zukin: \u201cShe is a prophet for Mexican food.\u201d And the chef Rick Bayless: \u201cShe\u2019s an incredible repository of knowledge.\u201d And Pati Jinich, host of the Emmy-nominated TV series Pati\u2019s Mexican Table: \u201cI think Mexico, as a country, will be eternally indebted to her efforts.\u201d\n\nShe usually travelled alone, with a tape recorder and sometimes a pistol\n\nThese quotes appear in a new documentary, Diana Kennedy: Nothing Fancy, by the filmmaker Elizabeth Carroll, which charts Kennedy\u2019s remarkable life. For years, Kennedy has travelled across Mexico \u2013 from Chihuahua, in the north, to Yucat\u00e1n, near the borders of Guatemala and Belize \u2013 in order to document its food culture, always with a sense of where she planned to go, but never entirely sure where she might end up. (\u201cThe important discoveries in my life have always happened by chance,\u201d she has said.) When she arrived in a new town, she would visit its food market, and she\u2019d ask the people she met there where they came from and what they liked to cook and how and which ingredients they used. Were they local? Were they imported from another state? Were they farmed or foraged? Later in life she roamed the country in a pickup. (\u201cI wish my trucks could speak out some of the experiences they\u2019ve been through with me.\u201d) But when she first arrived in Mexico she travelled by bus, \u201cwith all the chickens and the pigs\u201d, moving from village to village, region to region, taking great interest in the way food was cooked, the specificities of the recipes to which she was being introduced. She asked question after question. What were the local chillies? What were the local fruits? What were the local herbs? She touched. She tasted. She inhaled \u2013 fragrances as well as knowledge. \u201cAnything to escape,\u201d she says in the documentary, \u201cand to learn.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Down Mexico way: inspecting the produce at a local market. Photograph: Dogwoof\n\nWhenever possible, Kennedy would visit somewhere she had never been before, spending nights in the truck or, when the weather allowed, a hammock. She usually travelled alone. Sometimes she carried a tape recorder, sometimes a pistol. Nothing stopped her; her determination was unyielding. She would drive hundreds of miles in order to check a single fact \u2013 an ingredient, an exact measurement. In the foreword to The Cuisines of Mexico, the late food writer Craig Claiborne, a close friend of Kennedy\u2019s, wrote, \u201cIf her enthusiasm were not beautiful, it would border on mania.\u201d She travelled compulsively, and she was always forthright and urgent, perhaps a little intrusive. \u201cI wanted to know where people lived. I wanted to learn what the landscape looked like. I wanted to know more.\u201d But people always responded generously. They were fascinated by her fascination. So they invited this odd Englishwoman into their kitchens, and she would stay for hours, or days, or even a week. \u201cI felt at home immediately,\u201d she says, \u201cwherever I went.\u201d She would record recipes faithfully \u2013 the specific ingredients and the precise measurements \u2013 and return to Michoac\u00e1n, laden with local specialities, to recreate them at home. Whenever she published a recipe, she always mentioned where it came from, and the woman who had shared it with her.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Pot luck: trying out recipes at home, where she also held cookery classes for everyone from actors to renowned chefs. Photograph: Dogwoof\n\nKennedy first arrived in Mexico in 1957. She was born in Loughton, Essex, in 1923. After the Second World War she travelled to Jamaica, invited by a friend and \u201cpropelled by lots and lots of hormones\u201d, and then, impulsively, to Haiti. She landed during the revolution, along with several newspaper correspondents, including Paul Kennedy, a reporter with the New York Times. Paul was based in Mexico City. When he returned, Diana followed, \u201cand then began this absolutely fascinating time in love\u201d \u2013 with Paul, and then with the country that was now home. They married, and each time Paul left on a reporting trip, Diana left to explore her new world.\n\nPaul died in 1967, in New York, where they\u2019d gone so he could receive treatment for prostate cancer. In Manhattan, Diana felt out of her depth. She didn\u2019t know anyone. She was suddenly forced to hustle. She was \u201cterrifically depressed\u201d. Claiborne, the food writer, suggested she teach Mexican cooking, an idea she at first thought was crazy, but soon she was holding lessons in her apartment, \u201csix people in my little galley kitchen, cooking really traditional food. There was a dress designer, there was an actress. And here I was, teaching them how to make papadzules. I mean, hardly anyone in Mexico knew how to make papadzules. It was fun. It was a start.\u201d\n\nLater, an editor at Harper & Row suggested she write a cookbook, which became The Cuisines of Mexico, and that\u2019s when the work really began. Other cookbooks followed \u2013 cultural studies, really \u2013 and then appearances on cooking shows (Martha Stewart adored her) and then cooking shows of her own. In front of a camera she was formidable: eager to share what she\u2019d discovered in Mexico but also slightly protective of it, and always straight-talking, almost to the point of rudeness. She would growl things like, \u201cPeople say they don\u2019t like cilantro. Please don\u2019t invite them!\u201d Or, \u201cGet some texture into your food. We don\u2019t want baby food all the time.\u201d Or, \u201cYou might not have a molcajete\u201d \u2013 a Mexican mortar and pestle, made of volcanic rock \u2013 \u201cso buy one!\u201d\n\nBut the real work, the work she adored, was the travelling, using food as a way into people\u2019s lives \u2013 a \u201cdoctoral thesis performed in real time, in real life\u201d. She made the Michoac\u00e1n house her base. She didn\u2019t remarry. She never wanted children. (\u201cI don\u2019t want to bring up a little me. Can you imagine?\u201d). Instead, she gave herself to work. Carroll describes her as \u201can anthropologist of food\u201d who \u201chappens to be a killer cook\u201d. She has received heaps of awards, including the Order of the Aztec Eagle (big in Mexico), and a James Beard Foundation Award (big in food land). In 2002, Prince Charles visited Kennedy at her home to appoint her an MBE, for \u201cfurthering cultural relations between the UK and Mexico\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018Get some texture into your food\u2019: gathering produce from her garden. Photograph: Dogwoof\n\nDo these things matter to her? It\u2019s not clear. But legacy is important. In a scene from the documentary, Carroll films Kennedy running a cooking camp at her home. Some of the students are accomplished chefs. One owns three restaurants in Manhattan; another has five in Portland. But Kennedy is undaunted. At one point she moans: \u201cIt is absolutely appalling that Mexico is importing chillies,\u201d and admonishes chefs for not taking a stand. Later she half-shouts:\u201cLearn, learn, learn. Read my books and learn. What are you going to do when I\u2019m gone? Who is going to start screaming?\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a pressing question. Carroll filmed Kennedy over the course of six years, starting in 2013. \u201cWhen we first met her she was 91, running circles around us,\u201d Carroll says. \u201cShe was like, \u2018Get up, let\u2019s go to the market.\u2019 And we were like, \u2018This woman is three times our age!\u2019\u201d But by the end of filming, Kennedy had slowed, \u201cand you could see it was frustrating for her \u2013 that it\u2019s not the strength and energy she\u2019s been used to her whole life.\u201d When she spoke at a conference in 2013, Kennedy said, \u201cI am 90, so everybody gets very nervous, you see, that I\u2019m not going to be around much longer. So you\u2019ll want to hear all my complaints while I\u2019m alive.\u201d Recently those complaints have involved sustainability. \u201cWe live in such a diverse world,\u201d she says, \u201cand our education is so poor. How many kids at school realise how many insects there are? Millions and millions of different types, each playing their part in this marvellous universe.\u201d\n\nI was due to speak with Kennedy over the phone, but the call was delayed, and eventually cancelled. She is 97 now. Perhaps she has done all the talking she needs to do. Her legacy is assured. Her cookbooks are still in print. She is beloved by chefs, including Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s, who calls her \u201cthe Indiana Jones of food\u201d. But \u201cit\u2019s not just rushing in, getting a recipe and coming out,\u201d Kennedy says. \u201cIt\u2019s recreating it in your own kitchen. How do you express this recipe so that people can do it, so that it won\u2019t be lost? God knows I tried.\u201d She adds, \u201cYou can\u2019t win them all. You just go on doing what you know you want to do, and at some point the tide will turn and you make your mark, or you may not\u2026 I\u2019m very honoured the way so many people do look at my books and appreciate what I\u2019ve done.

Eight years later, he found himself fighting fascism with his fists and boots on the streets of London, despite a world war that had supposedly defeated the scourge of nazism for ever.\n\nKonopinski, now 90, joined the 43 Group, a guerrilla army of British-Jewish ex-servicemen and others that waged physical battle against the far right in the aftermath of the war. \u201cThe enemy hadn\u2019t gone away,\u201d he told the Observer.\n\nIt took four years to see off the postwar fascists. The group disbanded 70 years ago next month, and now there are only five members still alive: Konopinski, Harry Kaufman, Jerry Kaffin, Gerry Abrahams and Martin White. A sixth, Maurice Podro, died earlier this month.\n\nAmong the group, which quickly swelled after its formation from 43 to more than 1,000, was Vidal Sassoon, who joined as a teenager before finding fame as a hair stylist to the stars. The original founders \u201cdid not intend to allow the fascists ever again to rule the streets of London\u201d, wrote Sassoon years later. \u201cAnd so it began.

The 43 pledged to stop fascism by physical means if necessary.\n\nThey were soon engaging in confrontations on the streets. \u201cThey were violent and radical,\u201d said Daniel Sonabend, the author of We Fight Fascists: The 43 Group and their Forgotten Battle for Post-war Britain, published last year.\n\nThe enemy hadn't gone away Jules Konopinski, survivor\n\n\u201cThis was happening in the shadow of the second world war and the Holocaust.

These people will kill us, put us in the gas chambers. Therefore, they said, we have to stand up for ourselves.\u201d\n\nAmong the group\u2019s targets were Sunday-evening rallies in Ridley Road market, in east London, where hundreds of people gathered to hear Oswald Mosley, who was keen to revive his prewar British Union of Fascists, and his supporters.\n\nMorris Beckman, one of the 43 Group\u2019s founders, who died in 2015, recalled in his memoir: \u201cA young fascist about 18 years of age appeared in front of me and called me a \u2018fucking Jew bastard\u2019, catching my left thigh with a nearly well-aimed kick. I hit his nose square on and it spurted blood \u2026 I kicked his backside as hard as I could and he staggered off.

The establishment did not want anything that could bring Jews into disrepute or encourage more antisemitism. They saw any form of lawbreaking and violence as deeply problematic.\n\n\u201cThe response of 43 Group \u2013 which had raised a lot of money and plenty of prominent Jewish supporters \u2013 was to say the board was more worried about the reputation than the safety of the Jewish community.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Maurice Podro (who died on 17 May 2020) and Gerry Abrahams.

The figure bore some resemblance to others he knew but he had never seen this one before.\n\nIsla, now Peru\u2019s chief archaeologist for the lines, spent hours poring through archives, before returning to Peru \u2013 armed with a drone and a lifetime of local field experience \u2013 to find it.\n\nAfter several false starts, it took just two weeks to find the 25-by-65-metre image which had been hiding in plain sight in the hills of Palpa, about 30 miles north of Nazca, in a huge expanse of desert in southern Peru.\n\nThe design carved into the hillside depicts a terrifying mythological beast, part orca but with a human arm holding a trophy head and several more heads inside its body.\n\nNew research with drones has helped uncover hundreds of such figures carved in the desert near the lines in Nazca but which predate them by as much as 1,500 years. The archaeologists leading the effort now believe that the anthropomorphic orca figure fills in a missing link between hundreds of older geoglyphs and the Nazca culture\u2019s desert etchings.\n\nThe smaller forms were etched on hillsides in nearby Palpa by the Paracas and Topar\u00e1 cultures between 500BC and AD200.\n\n\u201cThis orca was made at a time of abundance and population growth in a moment of change from one society to another,\u201d said Isla.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The figure known as \u2018La Orca de Piedras Gordas\u2019, or The Orca, which was rediscovered by Johny Isla in Palpa. Photograph: Jorge de la Quintana/The Guardian\n\nIsla believe that the Topar\u00e1 crafted the orca figure during a period of dynamic transition. \u201cThe Nazca Lines are the culmination of a process of experimentation and improvement in technique which follow on from these older geoglyphs,\u201d said Isla.\n\nDating from AD200-700, the lines were given Unesco World Heritage status in 1994.\n\nAncient Peruvian Nazca turned land to desert Read more\n\nMore than a thousand of them \u2013 vast geometric patterns, and zoomorphic figures such as the monkey, the hummingbird and the whale \u2013 stretch across more than 400 sq km of the Nazca plateau. They were created by removing the top layer of pebbles to reveal the lighter-coloured material beneath.\n\nThe newly discovered geoglyphs\u2019 location on hillsides, however, marks a key difference, said Luis Jaime Castillo, a Peruvian archaeologist working on the Nazca-Palpa project with Isla.\n\n\u201cPlacing these geoglyphs on the slopes means that, in contrast with the Nazca Lines, you can see them if you are standing in the valley below where life and agriculture is taking place,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf the Nazca Lines were made by humans for the gods, these figures were made by humans for humans,\u201d explained Castillo, a former minister of culture for Peru. \u201cThey are clearly representations of identifiable people. They are demarcating territories.\u201d\n\nBy contrast, the larger and more sophisticated geoglyphs further south in Nazca can not be viewed completely from the ground.\n\nAccording to Isla, the latest research indicates the Nazca Lines were \u201cmade with the purpose of asking the Gods for water and fertility in this desert area\u201d.\n\nBut archaeologists are still trying to understand the transition between the Paracas culture\u2019s depiction of largely human figures intended to be viewed by other people to the Nazca iconography in which humans are all but absent.\n\nAs the society grew larger the images may have been appropriated by the elite and given a sacred status, Castillo believes. It was a transition from drawings made by households or villages to grand designs made by an organisation closer to a state, he argues.\n\nOn one hillside, a warrior wearing a headdress and carrying a staff or spear stands close to a female figure. Between them is a mythological creature with a mass of tentacles or snakes. The figures are believed to symbolise fertility.\n\nFrom the ground, the designs are now hard to see. But the drone\u2019s eagle-eye reveals the full design on a monitor viewed by Castillo, who has long promoted aerial mapping techniques to register Peru\u2019s estimated 100,000 archaeological sites, of which only a fraction have been excavated.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Pan-American highway cuts through the Nazca Lines which are some 450km south of Lima, the capital of Peru.

But just a few of the sites will be made known to the public so as not to make them a target for vandalism.

Born Charles County, Maryland, US, 8 August 1866.\n\nClaim to fame\n\nMatthew Henson, the descendant of slaves, has a plausible claim to being the first explorer to reach the North Pole. He grew up in Washington DC and Baltimore, was orphaned and left school at 12 to be a cabin boy. When he was 22, a chance encounter with naval engineer Robert Peary resulted in a lifelong working relationship, including 18 years of Arctic exploration. On 6 April 1909, Henson, Peary and four Inuit drove their dogsleds to the North Pole \u2013 or as near as makes no difference. Peary took the credit for being first, but a newspaper article on their return quoted Henson as saying he\u2019d been part of a leading group that had overshot the pole by several miles: \u201cWe went back then and I could see my footprints were the first at the spot.\u201d\n\nSupporting documentation\n\nHenson\u2019s engaging 1912 memoir, A Negro Explorer at the North Pole, reads like a Boy\u2019s Own Adventure.

The warmth of his response to the Inuit is striking: \u201cI have come to love these people \u2026 They are my friends and regard me as theirs.\u201d The memoir\u2019s final page includes the names of 218 Inuit from Smith Sound, on Canada\u2019s Ellesmere Island.

Dr Alyson McGregor raises the alarm\n\nTowards the end of her training in emergency medicine at Brown University, Rhode Island, Dr Alyson McGregor was asked what her \u201cspecialism\u201d would be.\n\n\u201cYou are expected to have a niche so my answer was, \u2018Well, I like women\u2019s health,\u2019\u201d says McGregor. \u201cFrom that, people thought, \u2018Oh, she\u2019s into obstetrics/gynaecology.\u2019\u201d So on busy shifts in the emergency department of Rhode Island Hospital, the state\u2019s major trauma centre, the newly qualified McGregor became everyone\u2019s go-to doctor for pelvic examinations because this was believed to be her special interest. \u201cI laugh about it now, but it\u2019s when I started to realise that there\u2019s this assumption that women\u2019s health is wrapped up in their reproduction. Women were men with \u2018boobs and tubes\u2019.\u201d\n\nBut McGregor was interested in far more than that. By women\u2019s health she meant the health of the whole woman, whose female chromosomes exist in every cell and influence every bodily function. She was interested in how these differences \u2013 in hormones, in tissue, in systems and structures \u2013 impact every disease and the way it should be treated. Cardiovascular health provided her route in.\n\n\u201cThis was about 15 years ago when people were realising that women having heart attacks presented differently to men,\u201d she says. \u201cThey described different symptoms and had poorer outcomes, so I started to ask why; and if we\u2019re different in this way, what about that way? The more I delved, the more I realised the scope of this. In medicine, we\u2019ve ignored women because we\u2019ve used men as our standard \u2013 and it hasn\u2019t served women well.\u201d\n\nWhen a doctor writes a prescription, ask, \u2018Is this specific to me as female?'\n\nMcGregor has set this out in her new book Sex Matters. It\u2019s a wake-up call, a cry for action, a frightening and fascinating read. The takeaway message is that women\u2019s bodies are different to men\u2019s from cellular level onwards, yet our medical model is based on knowledge gleaned from male cells, male animals and male humans. Within this, there\u2019s a wealth of disturbing detail \u2013 the diseases we routinely fail to understand in women, the drugs that work in men, while being useless, dangerous or even deadly in the other 50% of the population. In an age where we hear talk of \u201cpersonalised medicine\u201d and \u201ctargeted therapies\u201d, it\u2019s impossible to read this book without feeling stunned by science\u2019s failure to have factored all this in earlier. \u201cThat\u2019s a common reaction,\u201d says McGregor. \u201cI often hear, \u2018Gosh, I thought medicine was taking this into account!\u2019\u201d\n\nWe are talking a few weeks before the book\u2019s publication \u2013 though Sex Matters certainly won\u2019t have the launch once planned. Instead, McGregor is working long shifts in her emergency department because of Covid-19. (Her husband is a doctor, too \u2013 she tweeted pictures of the two of them in their protective gear.) When we Skype on her day off, I ask what life is like right now.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s challenging,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s the anxiety of being home and worrying about my family, and then my family worrying about us at work. And then being at work, but not recognising anyone because we\u2019re all covered up.\u201d The Covid cases in her hospital, says McGregor, are \u201cmanageable\u201d and, overall, her patient volumes are down. \u201cThe messaging has been, \u2018Stay home,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cThough that makes me worry, too, because where are the heart attacks, the complications from dialysis, the infections? I am seeing people with underlying psychiatric issues seeking care as the pandemic restrictions have increased anxiety and depression for so many.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018Women\u2019s health is assumed to be wrapped up in reproduction. We\u2019re seen as men with boobs and tubes\u2019: Dr Alyson McGregor in Rhode Island. Photograph: Benedict Evans/The Observer\n\nIn fact, the data on Covid-19 indicates that this, too, is a disease that affects men and women differently. Though many countries, including the US and UK, have been slow to publish detailed sex-specific information, those that have suggested it could have killed up to twice as many men as women. In the UK, an analysis of 4,000 cases by the Office of National Statistics found the same ratio, while figures from New York City Health suggest men account for more than 61% of Covid deaths. Social differences is one possible cause \u2013 in China, for example, far more men are smokers. Biological differences is another. Oestrogen helps stimulate the immune system, but the fact that women have two X chromosomes, which contain a high density of immune-related genes, could be key. (Men were also disproportionately affected by Sars and Mers.)\n\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to create a call for all countries to start collecting Covid-19 data by sex so that we can have this knowledge ahead of time,\u201d says McGregor. \u201cIn the H1N1 [swine flu] pandemic, it wasn\u2019t until we started looking at sex differences that we realised pregnant women were very susceptible to complications. If we have the information, we can look for explanations and target better treatments. And I\u2019m still not seeing it.\u201d\n\nMcGregor believes the reason can be traced back to the beginnings of organised medical research when it was decided that women of childbearing age should be excluded from trials \u2013 effectively taking sex differences out of the picture. The reason was to protect them, but for the medical profession and pharmaceutical industry it also made work faster, easier and cheaper by taking out pesky variables such as menstrual cycles and hormone surges. In Sex Matters, McGregor lists multiple ways that today\u2019s drugs can still fail women as a direct result. Women metabolise drugs differently (there are lots of reasons, but many are linked to different hormones and different levels of enzymes), so certain drugs remain in the system for longer or drop to dangerously low levels at certain points of the menstrual cycle. McGregor also shows how common fillers used in generic drugs \u2013 which are typically only tested for two weeks in a group of healthy males \u2013 can alter bioavailability (how much of the drug that will reach the body and work as planned) in women by up to 24%, which is why she often asks presenting patients if they\u2019ve recently switched to a generic.\n\nOne particularly frightening example is the impact of medication on our QT \u2013 that\u2019s the resting time between heartbeats. A woman\u2019s QT is already longer than a man\u2019s (a result of men\u2019s teenage testosterone surge) and many prescription drugs \u2013 painkillers, antidepressants, antihistamines, antibiotics \u2013 cause incremental QT increases as a side-effect. For women on multiple meds (and statistically, women are most likely to be on multiple meds), the risk of these combined increases can range from simple arrhythmia to sudden cardiac death.\n\nMcGregor gives the example of one patient, a woman in her 40s whose back pain resulted in a common medication spiral \u2013 painkillers then sleeping tablets then steroids then anti-anxiety meds, and finally an antibiotic for a UTI. This cocktail, she believes, caused the patient sudden cardiac death, something she says is \u201cmore common than many physicians would like to admit\u201d. One German study found that 66% of long QT syndrome patients were female \u2013 and of these, 60% were drug-related.\n\n\u201cHydroxychloroquine, the drug being trialled as a treatment for Covid [and hyped by Donald Trump], also has the side-effect of prolonging QT interval,\u201d says McGregor. \u201cIf it\u2019s prescribed to a female, we should have her QT interval measured first, but that\u2019s not even in the discussion.\u201d In fact, she is concerned that in the race to find a Covid vaccine, reverting to standard research protocols (male cells, male animals and no sex-specific analysis of human trials) could result in dangerous gaps in knowledge.\n\nSome of the areas covered in Sex Matters are already in the public eye. The British Heart Foundation is halfway through a three-year campaign to tackle what it calls the \u201cheart attack gender gap\u201d \u2013 a UK woman is 50% more likely than a man to receive an initial wrong diagnosis for a heart attack and, even after correct diagnosis, significantly less likely to receive life-saving treatments. One reason could be that women\u2019s symptoms don\u2019t always fit previous male-centric models. In men, plaque tends to build up, causing blood vessels to rupture. In women, plaque is more likely to gradually erode, making blood vessels stiffer and less flexible over time.\n\nJulie Ward is a senior cardiac nurse with the British Heart Foundation who has worked on the campaign\u2019s All-Party Parliamentary Group. \u201cCoronary care has been male-driven,\u201d she says. \u201cTreated by men using research by men carried out on men. We\u2019re only now beginning to understand the different physiology. Part of our campaigning is to encourage more UK women to sign up for trials, and also to encourage more women to become cardiologists.\u201d\n\nOur treatments for pain are another area where women are poorly served. Epidemiologic studies clearly demonstrate that women are at greater risk of pain conditions \u2013 from migraines to musculoskeletal, from IBS to PMS. The interaction between the sex hormones, neurotransmitters, like dopamine and serotonin, and the central nervous system is one key reason (a study of transsexuals undergoing hormone therapy found that half of those transitioning from female to male reported improvements in chronic pain conditions.)\n\nWhen a man says he\u2019s in a bit of pain, we think he\u2019s in a lot of pain. When a woman says it, we think she\u2019s worried\n\nThere\u2019s also women\u2019s XX chromosomes that create those aggressive immune responses so effective in fighting disease, but also prone to turn on the body itself (autoimmune diseases, such as lupus and osteoarthritis, are far more common in women). Yet women are more likely than men to receive a psychiatric diagnosis than a physical one (panic attack instead of heart attack), more likely than men to be given lifestyle advice rather than an exploratory x-ray when presenting with IBS \u2013 and in the case of \u201cwomen\u2019s conditions\u201d such as endometriosis, highly likely to be told that the pain they\u2019re experiencing is \u201cnormal\u201d. (In the UK, it takes women an average of 7.5 years to get an endometriosis diagnosis \u2013 and even then, we\u2019ve developed few effective treatments for this debilitating disease.)\n\nDr Amanda Williams, Reader in Clinical Health Psychology at University College London agrees that women\u2019s pain is typically downplayed. \u201cPatient studies show it,\u201d she says. \u201cWomen are prescribed less analgesic. When a man says he\u2019s in a bit of pain, we think he\u2019s really in a lot of pain. When a woman says she\u2019s in a lot of pain, we think she\u2019s in a bit of pain, but worried about it.\u201d\n\nAccording to Williams, this can be traced back to Darwinism and the belief in a great \u201cchain of being\u201d, which put men at the top of the hierarchy and women at the lower end. Beliefs about pain reflected power and status. \u201cBlack people endured horrendous hardship and brutality so it was said that they were less sensitive to pain, and women endured childbirth, which was pretty painful, so it was believed they were oversensitive, prone to hysterics.\u201d White European men, it was decided, had it just about right.\n\nIt\u2019s a bleak picture, but McGregor is confident it\u2019s changing. She is now a recognised sex and gender expert in emergency medicine at Brown (which covers a lot more than pelvic examinations)and has co-founded the Sex and Gender Health Collaborative, a national organisation which works to integrate sex and gender knowledge into medical education and clinical practice. \u201cIt has been an interesting evolution,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen I first started talking about this, no one really understood what I was saying or didn\u2019t quite see the importance. Most physicians are data-driven \u2013 and now there\u2019s exponential data coming through that shows how significant sex differences can be. Now I see a different response when I\u2019m speaking. In 2016, the top research funder in the US stated you must include sex as a biological variable in your research design.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest It\u2019s too big to wait for change from the top down. It took great grass-roots efforts to have women\u2019s reproductive health taken seriously\u2019: Dr Alyson McGregor. Photograph: Benedict Evans/The Observer\n\nSex Matters was written to educate and empower the rest of us. \u201cIt\u2019s too big to wait for change from the top down,\u201d says McGregor. \u201cIf you look at past experiences, it took great grass-roots efforts to have women\u2019s reproductive health taken seriously.\u201d\n\nThe book is packed with specific advice for female patients, ranging from volunteering for medical trials to researching sex differences in prescriptions, recording side-effects, joining patient support groups, keeping careful records of symptoms and treatments and taking an advocate along to appointments. She also urges women to be pushier patients. \u201cWhen a doctor writes a prescription, ask, \u2018Is this specific to me as female? Should I have a different dose? Will I have different side-effects? Will this affect my birth control? Should I take a different drug at certain times of my menstrual cycle?\u2019 A doctor may not know those answers \u2013 but most people who go to medical school take an oath of lifelong learning. I hope doctors will say, \u2018Let me look.\u2019\u201d\n\nThough McGregor believes it can be done in 10 years, the scale of change required seems enormous. \u201cYes,\u201d she nods happily, \u201cmammoth! I absolutely agree \u2013 and I make no apology for that. Each hypothesis is based on the one before and the one before \u2013 and if this has all been male, we unfortunately need to start from scratch. But I think it\u2019s a moral obligation we have for half the population.\u201d\n\nSex Matters: How Male-Centric Medicine Endangers Women\u2019s Health and What We Can Do About It, by Dr Alyson J McGregor, is published by Quercus at \u00a316.99.

People set up lawn chairs on the grass,\u201d said Davis, an ocean rescue lifeguard with the county. \u201cIf the goal was to keep people from congregating, all it did was really push them a few feet away.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, when the beach officially reopened, it remained calm. Beachgoers trickled in, keeping their distance from each other, though not usually wearing masks. Davis was relieved.\n\nAmid the Covid-19 pandemic, beaches \u2013 like testing and lockdowns \u2013 have become a polarizing issue. When photographs of a newly opened and crowded Jacksonville Beach in northern Florida flooded social media, critics tweeted #FloridaMorons. In New York City, residents are angry at Mayor Bill de Blasio\u2019s previous decision to keep city beaches closed during Memorial Day weekend.\n\nBeaches tend to evoke more reaction and anger than parks and other public spaces. It\u2019s in large part, experts say, because the US shoreline is increasingly private, and controlled by fewer, and richer, people.\n\n\u201cWe went from a time, prior to WWII, where much of American shorelines were treated as public land, to a frenzy of privatization where the shoreline was gobbled up,\u201d said Andrew Kahrl, a professor at the University of Virginia who wrote The Land Was Ours: African American Beaches from Jim Crow to the Sunbelt South.\n\nEarlier in the 19th century, US beaches were largely public and inhabited by working-class coastal communities, many of them African American watermen, Kahrl said. The coastline wasn\u2019t coveted property, since it was hard to maintain in the face of natural forces like hurricanes and high tide, and it was groups like the Gullah, who were the keepers.\n\nBy 1970, however, over 95% of US coastlines suitable for recreation were closed to the general public. To add to those restrictions, many municipalities imposed parking fees and tolled roads to limit entry.\n\nThe result is that our public beaches have become smaller and more crowded, while a small group of affluent elite hold the keys to the rest of the coastline. \u201cThe public\u2019s ability to enjoy the shoreline has decreased in direct proportion to our increasing inequality,\u201d Kahrl said.\n\nDuring the pandemic, this dichotomy has become even more obvious. Public health officials promote exercise and fresh air during citywide lockdowns, and virologists have said it\u2019s largely safe to be outside as long as people observe physical distancing. But, as the Guardian reported earlier this week, 100 million Americans, especially people of color and poor communities, don\u2019t have access to a decent park or public space, which includes beaches.\n\nThe public\u2019s ability to enjoy the shoreline has decreased in direct proportion to our increasing inequality Andrew Kahrl\n\nNeighborhoods in New York suffer from this lack of access, said Meg Walker, an architect with the Project for Public Spaces, including many of the neighborhoods in the boroughs of Queens and the Bronx that were hit hardest by Covid-19. \u201cThere\u2019s many people in these densely populated neighborhoods who have high asthma rates and poor air quality,\u201d she said, risk factors for the virus.\n\nWalker also pointed out that public beaches, even more than parks, tend to bring together people of different backgrounds, especially around holidays. The diversity on a public beach lies in stark contrast to that of a privately owned beach, which tends to skew white and upper class.\n\nThe increased policing on beaches burdens black communities, who are more likely to have tense interactions with law enforcement. Already this year, in Los Angeles and Miami, the NAACP raised an alarm when black beachgoers were reportedly aggressively accosted by police.\n\nDuring the pandemic beaches have been caught in the political divide between Republican states that have loosened restrictions early and Democrat-run states, who have been far more cautious. In this case, states like Florida and South Carolina, which have long coastlines and Republican governors, opened their beaches as people in the north-east, governed by Democrats, remained at home.\n\nNow, as many communities in the north-east start to open up, they have decided to keep their shores closed to outsiders. In Connecticut, home to what Kahrl calls the country\u2019s most \u201cexclusionary coastline\u201d, beaches are requiring residential passes to park near the shore. In Long Island, a cluster of suburbs near New York City, county officials have made it clear that people from the city are not welcome.\n\nAs County Executive, my number one priority will always be the health and safety of our residents.\n\n\n\nIn order to ensure Nassau residents can enjoy our only County-operated beach, I will sign legislation designating Nickerson Beach for Nassau residents\u2019 use only. \u2014 Laura Curran (@NassauExecutive) May 19, 2020\n\nOyster Bay, a quiet hamlet on Long Island with private beaches, normally allows non-residents to visit the beach on weekdays, but not on weekends. Throughout the pandemic, however, all of its beaches have remained closed to outsiders.\n\n\n\nJoseph Saladino, the Oyster Bay supervisor, said the hamlet has erected barriers at the local train station, and entry points to the beach to make sure that only residents can enter. \u201cWe understand the beach offers a place for recreation but also an emotional renewal of sorts,\u201d Saladino said. But he said the restrictions were necessary to keep the capacity under 50%, and protect the residents who pay taxes in Oyster Bay.\n\nPublic space advocates agree there is a real risk of beachgoers posing a threat to public health \u2013 young people in Miami during spring break in March, for example, ended up spreading Covid-19 to other parts of the country because the beaches were completely unregulated and had no distancing restrictions.\n\nUnlike parks, many beaches have also been at least partly closed throughout the lockdown, and when they open people might seize the opportunity in droves. \u201cI think there will be a flood of users,\u201d Walker said.\n\nBut the solution, she said, is not restricting access to beaches. It\u2019s continuing to open more public spaces, like pedestrian roadways, and coming up with community-driven, creative ways to remind people to take precautions. In Detroit, for example, there was a project to open urban beaches for residents. And Walker pointed out artists making public health signs instead of law enforcement.\n\nMeanwhile, Davis in Palm Beach was preparing for a surge of Memorial Day beach visitors because public beaches in nearby Miami and Broward counties remained closed.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re wondering what it\u2019s going to look like this weekend,\u201d he said. \u201cAs far as we\u2019re concerned we\u2019re still maintaining our primary objective \u2013 making sure people are physical distancing.\u201d", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/24/us-beaches-covid-19-florida-access-parks", "published": "2020-05-24T00:00:00", "author": ["Ankita Rao"]}, {"title": "New York Stock Exchange traders hope to prove they are still a big noise", "text": "The shouty blokes in blue jackets return to Wall Street this week.

To its supporters, it is an important and more sophisticated adjunct to the vast majority of market trades, which are conducted by machines.\n\nIf an investor wants to buy a stock at $10, the computer will quickly find a seller and make that trade. But a human on the exchange floor would talk to other traders and might discover lots of potential sellers milling around, and use their judgment to decide whether it is worth waiting to see if the price falls.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the difference between [takeaway] delivery and going to a restaurant, where you can look at the menu and talk to the waiter about the specials,\u201d floor trader Steve Grasso told the Washington Post last month. \u201cYou get your food either way. But you get an inferior experience if you don\u2019t go to the restaurant.\u201d\n\nGrasso is a bit of a Wall Street television celebrity, which brings us to the opposing view of the physical trading floor: that it is a shameless marketing ploy, useful only as a backdrop for the network\u2019s financial news bulletins. The viewers expect a trading floor, damn it, so we\u2019ll give them a trading floor.\n\nThis expectation can also get turned up a notch during crises, when Wall Street suddenly morphs into a symbol of the American way of life.\n\nAfter the 11 September 2001 attacks, the exchanges closed down completely, but the markets swiftly reopened (before, predictably, slumping) and then New York mayor Rudy Giuliani memorably described Wall Street as a \u201cmonument to our liberty\u201d.It was tricky to argue with Giuliani, and now that he\u2019s President Donald Trump\u2019s lawyer, one wonders if he will be back this week to mark the rebirth of open outcry.\n\nIf he does make a trip to the trading floor, the former mayor will need (depending on where he gets his medical advice) a pen for signing the inevitable document indemnifying the NYSE against potential lawsuits, a hydroxychloroquine bagel and a hip flask of bleach.", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/23/new-york-stock-exchange-open-outcry-coronavirus-giuliani", "published": "2020-05-23T00:00:00", "author": ["Simon Goodley"]}, {"title": "Seasonal workers who have travelled to the UK: share your experiences", "text": "We want to hear from seasonal workers who have travelled to the UK to pick fruit and vegetables\n\nSeasonal workers who have travelled to the UK: share your experiences\n\nHundreds of workers have been flown in from Romania to pick fruit and vegetables after it was reported that thousands of British workers rejected job offers.

With world heavyweight champion Tyson Fury frequently advocating the value of boxing and fitness towards his own mental health, the connection with boxing and emotional health has never been stronger.\n\nEFC predominantly works with people aged eight to 25 who experience significant challenges in their lives, including those excluded from school and involved in antisocial behaviour \u2013 almost always as a result of mental health issues. With a unique programme of support, EFC provides an invaluable resource to more than 4,000 people each year in one of the UK\u2019s most deprived areas. It offers young people who would probably not access traditional forms of therapy a variety of bespoke services designed to support complicated home lives, blighted by poverty, deprivation and inadequate housing.\n\n\u201cWe are a charity that uses boxing, non-contact boxing and boxing training as a hook, to leverage the street credibility of the sport to knock down some of the barriers to entry for some of society\u2019s most difficult to reach young people,\u201d says EFC. Alongside that, it offers intensive personal development, psychological support, therapy, and advice on careers and education.\n\n\u201cYoung people arrive at our doors with a range of behavioural and emotional issues, including anger, anxiety, depression and low self-esteem,\u201d says Bisp. \u201cTheir distress is often expressed in ways that can lead them into trouble rather than care and support.\u201d Young people are referred to EFC by schools, charities, pupil referral units and even the police.\n\nBisp says: \u201cI\u2019ve not yet met a 10-, 12-, or 13-year-old whose real life ambition is to be selling drugs or who wants to get involved in some of the situations they have been involved in. We have not yet met young people who have any desire to be mentally unwell. What happens is that their behaviour can manifest itself in certain ways. What we\u2019ve found is that if you look at the symptom of anger or criminal behaviour, there are always underlying core problems. It may be chaotic home lives, it may be substance abuse by the parents, it could be domestic abuse, it could be sexual abuse. There is a whole series of factors that can lead into a behaviour that becomes symptomatic, which then gets a young person labelled.\u201d Through its unique package of non-contact boxing and intensive personal support, EFC seeks to challenge and inspire vulnerable young people to \u201crealise their unique potential\u201d and participate in sport, gaining support in ways that feel natural.\n\nMarvin Rees, the first directly elected black mayor of a UK city, trained at the gym as a young man. \u201cI was a very lost teenager, a mixed-race kid in the middle of a racially fractured Bristol in the 1980s,\u201d he says. \u201cPoor family, living in the inner city about 200 metres from this club. I had a reasonable brain but I was immobilised by a fear of failure and low self-esteem. Through boxing, I got a real sense of confidence. And I was also around coaches who cared.\u201d\n\nI was a very lost teenager, a mixed-race kid in the middle of a racially fractured Bristol in the 1980s Marvin Rees, mayor of Bristol\n\nMany of the young people EFC works with may have fallen through the gaps in mental health services or be waiting to receive support. \u201cThe young people we are dealing with come from chaotic home lives, maybe lack of parental support, lack of parents in total, they have mental health issues,\u201d says Sanigar. \u201cThey want to access mental health services but the waiting list with CAMHS (child and adolescent mental health services) can be six months. The hoops that a young person has to go through \u2013 visiting the GP, getting a referral to CAMHS, making that appointment, filling out the forms \u2026 That is challenging enough if you\u2019ve got two parents in a middle-class family. But when you\u2019ve probably not got the support, the barriers to entry for that service are too challenging and too long-winded, too time-consuming and too late in the day. Within that period of time, anything could have happened.\u201d\n\nDescribing some mental health services as \u201cculturally incompetent\u201d, Rees says: \u201c[Mental health services] are white middle-class services, designed by white middle-class people. What that means isthat if you are this type of person, it is going to work for you. If you are not, it probably won\u2019t.\u201d\n\nBisp says: \u201cThe feedback we get is that traditional talking therapy is middle-class, [young people] are often dealing with somebody they can\u2019t relate to. We\u2019re talking about a highly intimidatory atmosphere for a young person who is not confident and comfortable enough in themselves to sit in a room with somebody they barely know and start talking about their problems.\u201d\n\nThis is the sort of place where you don\u2019t even realise you are being cured, but you are Prince Harry\n\nVisiting the gym in 2019, Prince Harry said: \u201cThe thought of sitting down in a chair, one to one, with a therapist, can be a real deterrent. However, this is the sort of place where you don\u2019t even realise you are being cured, but you are.\u201d\n\n\u201cA lot of these kids have gone through so much, it might be physical or sexual abuse, it could be anything \u2013 and they are angry,\u201d Bisp says. \u201cRather than try and tell people they shouldn\u2019t feel angry, actually what we start talking about is that anger is perfectly normal. Anger is a manifestation of issues, and they are issues they have a right to be angry about. So, what we\u2019re teaching them is how to react and how to deal with those situations in a way that\u2019s constructive.\u201d\n\nBisp, who developed the programme along with Sanigar and a team of sports psychologists, says that \u201cthe metaphor [they] have built through the boxing relates back to the young person\u2019s individual life, and that\u2019s what the psychology is trying to do. That mini-goal might be \u2018don\u2019t get thrown out of school Monday\u2019, \u2018don\u2019t take drugs Tuesday\u2019. The psychology is about how it relates to the boxing, but really it\u2019s about how it relates to life.\u201d Through positive affirmation and the strong relationship built through the sport, the coaches are then able to use that relationship to offer support outside of the gym. \u201cI can\u2019t just come in here and start talking to them, but we use boxing as a tool to engage them and that\u2019s when we bring in our development points,\u201d says Ako, a coach at EFC.\n\nThe former IBF featherweight world champion Lee Selby is a mentor at the club. \u201cI try and get into them that I\u2019ve worked my way up,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not just sports that that works in, it\u2019s general life. If you work hard you can achieve your goals and your dreams.\u201d The influence of somebody such as Selby on marginalised young people \u2013 many of whom will have grown up watching and hearing of his achievements \u2013 can be dramatic. \u201cThey know I am from the same sort of background and they can relate to me,\u201d he says. \u201cAt school they are being told what to do by some posh guy and they are not really interested.\u201d\n\nThey know I am from the same sort of background and they can relate to me Lee Selby, former featherweight world champion\n\nFor many of the young people, a supportive, nurturing relationship with an adult can be a new experience. Sarah, foster mother of April, 16, describes how April\u2019s relationship with her coach Courtney \u201chas grown to the point where Courtney is a trusted adult. That has been a rare thing for her in her life, in her experience. It\u2019s really important.\u201d\n\nThis type of relationship at EFC is built and maintained over a 20-week programme that combines non-contact boxing with mentoring and psychological education. The coaches believe that boxing, being largely individual and broken into three-minute rounds, allows a unique opportunity for therapy and mentoring.\n\n\u201cThe way that boxing is broken down into rounds means you\u2019ve got opportunities to build relationships and to talk while they are doing the activity,\u201d says Sanigar. \u201cThey can be skipping and you can be having a conversation. They can stop for a minute, you can have a conversation, you can\u2019t do that in football. You have your own individual goal set by a coach, and your goal might be to get five skips. We build small mini-goals for young people to achieve.\u201d\n\nEllie, 15, was referred to EFC by her therapist. \u201cI had a really bad home growing up,\u201d she says. \u201cI never had space where I could just go to relax. It was always tension, tension, tension. I struggle with really bad anger issues. They have calmed down a lot, so much, since being here. Even after the first session you could see the difference. I\u2019d keep everything in and wouldn\u2019t let anything out. They really taught me how to open up about how I\u2019m feeling. It\u2019s definitely made a difference in every aspect of my life.\u201d\n\nNina, who has PTSD, depression and social anxiety says Empire has made her \u201cless anxious about being in groups, and being with new people\u201d. She adds: \u201cI just feel comfortable being able to come back even if I don\u2019t have to do the sessions. I can speak to someone, it doesn\u2019t necessarily even have to be about what\u2019s going on, it can just be about anything which helps and it\u2019s a nice distraction from everything else.\u201d\n\nDontae, 17, was referred to the gym after being excluded from school a number of times. He is now at college studying health and fitness and says: \u201cI started coming in more and more regularly. I started loving it and my confidence grew more and more; knowing how I feel, and telling them how I feel, and them listening to how I feel. It\u2019s helped me to calm down. They are basically like mentors to me. My mental health has got better. My mental health was just about anger, anger, anger. Now it isn\u2019t. I feel better, I feel more normal. I feel more awareness, mentally stronger, knowing what decisions can benefit me.\u201d\n\nOne issue that EFC regularly identifies in young people is low self-esteem and sense of self-worth. \u201cThe level of extremity has drastically changed over recent years\u201d, says Sanigar. \u201cThis is inner city, an area of deprivation that is going through a bit of a funny change at the moment. A three-bed house will cost you over \u00a3300,000. If you are growing up in this area with nothing \u2013 no role models, no mentors \u2013 it\u2019s practically impossible now for you to get on the property ladder. Youth services have been closed. There is nothing for them and they are becoming more isolated, sitting in their bedrooms. They are living a fantasy life on their phones, where it\u2019s Instagram, Snapchat \u2013 all these wonderful lives out there. They are suddenly looking at their lives and it is destroying their self-esteem.\u201d\n\nOnce a young person has been supported psychologically, EFC looks to address some of the issues which have a detrimental effect on a young person\u2019s wellbeing and self-esteem, such as unemployment. Its careers service sees 90% of users find employment, training or higher education.\n\nSanigar says: \u201cIt\u2019s inspiring young people to understand the opportunities that are out there, which they often won\u2019t get to see. With careers we look at what inspires you, what is it that gets you excited. If it\u2019s football, the likelihood is you\u2019re not going to be a Premier League footballer but we will take you up to a local football club. There are 80 different trades there, from the marketing department to the stadium manager to the groundsman. [These are] all careers in football at one level or another. It may still involve them getting a shift at Tesco or Ikea, to work their way along that ladder but there is an ultimate goal. For us, it\u2019s about making the underlying, lasting changes to a person\u2019s life.\u201d\n\nOne of the employment schemes EFC runs is with local coffee roasters Extract Coffee, who offer a barista training programme. Steven, 20, found employment after completing the course: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have got the job at Boston Tea Party without Empire giving me that push. When I started coming to Empire I wasn\u2019t in a great place, but now everything has changed. After doing boxing sessions day by day, my mood generally got a lot better. I feel happier, I don\u2019t have those days when I don\u2019t feel like doing anything because I don\u2019t have the self-esteem or the energy. I\u2019m actively looking to do stuff. Compared to where I first started that\u2019s quite a big leap.\u201d\n\nEFC has also trained qualified therapists in non-contact boxing skills in order to provide support to young people with some of the most severe mental health issues.\n\n\u201cThe demographic we have here is very varied,\u201d says therapist Jane Ivall. \u201cOften they will be some of the hardest-to-reach young people. The fact they are engaging and connecting here is a good starting point for them engaging and connecting with us. Here, there is a whole range of people with a whole range of issues, and we just come alongside them using the medium of boxing to enable them to access mental health support. The boxing breaks down the barriers to traditional therapy. It enables people to open up and access things they traditionally may not feel comfortable to access. Talking about a trauma is complex. Working physically enables you to shift trauma, to explore things and to build a rapport and trust with a therapist quicker.\u201d\n\nRather than try and tell people they shouldn\u2019t feel angry, what we start talking about is that anger is perfectly normal Martin Bisp, EFC founder\n\nFor many who come to EFC, boxing has a unique appeal that alleviates any stigma that may come with accessing more traditional mental health or careers services. Sanigar points to the \u201ccredibility and grit\u201d about what EFC does: \u201cBoxers and boxing gyms are respected within these communities. I would say that in any deprived community in the world there is a boxing gym. [Young people] are not embarrassed to come. They can be in here, doing a CV, doing homework, having a one-to-one session with a therapist, having a group session, with a coach and some psychology, some career goals, this and that. And that\u2019s the beauty of it. To everyone else, they\u2019ve just been to the boxing club.\u201d\n\nIn 2019, EFC supported 4,245 young people. The impact is striking. Among those young people, the suicide ideation rate dropped significantly and 74% are no longer at risk of exclusion from school, 78% are no longer committing antisocial or criminal behaviour, 84% are more motivated and 73% are happier.\n\nAccording to Rees, \u201cthe benefits to the wider city are pretty straightforward: a healthier population. Young people who are less likely to become mentally unwell, who have more structure in their lives and who are better able to develop their own talents, abilities and ambitions in life. They are also less likely to become service users, or engage in activities that take away the quality of life from other people.\u201d\n\nFor Ivall, EFC is \u201calmost like a one-stop community shop \u2026 with support and care, and I\u2019m going to use the word love, though the boxing guys would probably shoot me for that. [There is] support of real compassion and kindness which is un-judgmental and nondiscriminatory in any shape, size or form. It doesn\u2019t matter who you are, if you come through that door you can have that support. That\u2019s life-changing.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not careers specialists, we\u2019re not education specialists, we\u2019re not mental health specialists,\u201d says Bisp. \u201cWe\u2019ve had to just do our best and what we think is right, and thankfully the results over the last 10 years have proven that what we do does work\u201d.", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/24/knocking-down-barriers-through-boxing-photo-essay", "published": "2020-05-24T00:00:00", "author": ["Alexander Turner"]}, {"title": "Anxious hands on New York's subway \u2013 in pictures", "text": "Brooklyn-based photographer Hannah La Follette Ryan has, for the past five years, captured the hands of passengers on the New York subway.

If we were ever tempted to view those post-industrial years in political black and white, Biaolobrzeski\u2019s pictures insist on colouring them in. They retain a saturated bleakness all the same.\n\nBiaolobrzeski came to the contrasts of those years as an outsider, working in England on assignment from his native Germany. This photograph was taken at Epsom racetrack. The young women in their silk frocks appear to be cast in a parody of the nation\u2019s perennial costume drama.

I felt privileged to be German, not because I am a nationalist, but because I was born into a society which was less class-ridden and cared more for the individual. For the first time in 30-odd years I felt a kind of pride in being German.\u201d\n\nGive My Regards to Elizabeth is published by Hartmann/Dewi Lewis (\u00a334)", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/may/24/the-big-picture-a-day-at-epsom-racecourse", "published": "2020-05-24T00:00:00", "author": ["Tim Adams"]}, {"title": "The week in wildlife \u2013 in pictures", "text": "A family of elephants graze in Ol Pejeta conservation facility in Kenya.

But \u201cthey can only be fortresses for so long.\u201d\n\nFor their part, the megabanks are trying to project strength. In a March 11 meeting with President Donald Trump at the White House, Citigroup CEO Michael Corbat said the financial system is \u201cin sound shape, and we are here to help.\u201d\n\nBankers argue that they rely much less on debt to fund their operations and have much more cash on hand than they did during the crisis to help them keep lending during a downturn. Citi, JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and five other major banks said over the weekend that they'd stop buying back their own shares through June as they pledge to help struggling consumers and businesses.\n\nThe largest banks have also successfully weathered the Federal Reserve\u2019s so-called stress tests, which require them to show every year how they would manage risks under a hypothetical severe recession. The exercise was launched in 2009 in the depth of the crisis to help restore confidence in the banking system.\n\nBut financial markets are already showing signs of strain, with stocks in recent weeks wiping out most of their huge gains since Trump's election and trading in U.S. government bond markets becoming irregular, a situation that prompted the Fed to inject piles of cash into funding markets. Troubles are also growing in the market for a type of short-term business debt known as commercial paper.\n\nOne of the biggest risks that regulators like the Fed have been watching is the rise in loans to companies that are already highly indebted, as well as the volume of corporate bonds that are so risky that mutual funds may not be allowed to hold them. If a lot of companies start to default on their debt, it could blow back not only directly on banks, but also other lenders and investors that do business with them.", "link": "https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/16/big-banks-coronavirus-onslaught-132997", "published": "2020-03-16T00:00:00", "author": []}, {"title": "Fears mount of a coronavirus-induced depression", "text": "The rescue package being debated in Washington would involve at least $1.6 trillion of government spending, representing just a few weeks of lost economic activity.

And it promised efforts to aid small and midsize businesses that are failing in large numbers, a main street lending program that could multiply the power of the congressional spending package.\n\nBut that did not ease fears in the stock market, where the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 3 percent to 18,591.93 \u2014 the lowest since November 2016.

Public health authorities can customize the system and combine it with data that users input voluntarily, the companies said.\n\nStates including North Dakota and Alabama have already requested and received access to the tech tools, as have 22 countries outside the U.S., according to Apple and Google. Countries including Germany, Italy and Ireland \u2014 all of which will base their national apps on the companies\u2019 technology \u2014 are expected to release their apps in the coming weeks.\n\nHealth experts say contact tracing is essential to slowing the illness' spread and allowing the economy to reopen safely, and U.S. states are pouring millions of dollars into hiring people to go about it in low-tech teams. The phone-based apps aim to supercharge the effort, but doubts are already emerging about the effectiveness of the Google-Apple initiative, in part because the companies are imposing privacy restrictions on the types of information that health agencies can collect.\n\nFor instance, the apps will be able to tell when a smartphone user has been near a person who has tested positive for the coronavirus \u2014 but won't track the locations where the infected person has been. In contrast, states such as North Dakota have deployed apps that use GPS location tracking, which they say could help identify geographic hotspots in sparsely populated areas.\n\nOn the other hand, some privacy restrictions may be necessary to win over a public skittish after years of complaints about Silicon Valley's use of people\u2019s personal data. A recent Washington Post-University of Maryland poll found that nearly 60 percent of Americans could or would not use apps designed using Apple's and Google's technology. About 82 percent of Americans have smartphones, pollsters found.\n\n\u201cEither you have a system unlikely to help people navigate their world, to leave their house and feel safe, or you have privacy trade-offs,\" said University of Washington Law School professor Ryan Calo.\n\nMeanwhile, some states like California already plan to use the technology, and North Dakota has said it will build a second app that complies with the companies' rules.\n\nA similar debate has played out in Europe, where the big tech companies clashed with, and ultimately prevailed over, government leaders who were pursuing their own versions of contract tracing apps before largely conceding to the approach being pushed by Apple and Google.\n\nThe two companies have said that authorized public health agencies' contact-tracing apps can have access to the Apple-Google technology as long as they agree to the privacy restrictions. Apple and Google have also suggested that countries should deploy just one app each to increase user adoption, but the companies added they will work with state and regional governments as well.\n\nThe two companies have a lot of leverage because, together, they control the underlying software used on almost all smartphones. That means apps that work Apple's and Google's technology would have a greater chance of seeing widespread adoption \u2014 a critical factor in whether any phone-based tracing effort succeeds.\n\nPOLITICO NEWSLETTERS Morning Tech Technology news from Washington and Silicon Valley \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox.

If any of the people later test positive for coronavirus, they can choose to anonymously notify others whom they may have exposed to the illness in the past two weeks.\n\nThe technology has also been developed to allow Android and iPhone devices to communicate with one another and to do so without devouring the smartphone's battery life, factors also seen as critical to the apps working as public health officials hope.\n\nApple and Google have stood firm on not allowing apps that use their software to collect location data, and the technology is designed so that neither company will have access to patients\u2019 identities or sensitive health information.

He added the agency is working with companies to mitigate the shortage.\n\nFDA did not identify the medicine, but it updates its drug shortage list daily. New additions over the past few days included antibacterial infusion Avycaz and Mylan-made beta-blocker Pindolol, for which stock is low because of shortage of an active ingredient.\n\nFDA also shed light on possible challenges for device supplies. It announced that is knows of 63 manufacturers that utilize 72 factories in China to make \"essential\" medical devices \u2014 including many with worker shortages due to the coronavirus. No such devices are reported to be in short supply, but device makers aren't legally required to disclose if circumstances exist that could lead to shortages.\n\nWidespread shortages of personal protective equipment like masks, gloves or surgical gowns are not being reported, but FDA said it is aware of reports that health care providers are increasing orders of the protective devices to prepare for a potential severe U.S. outbreak. Some related supply challenges for certain devices have been reported to the agency.\n\nLIMITED CORONAVIRUS TESTING CAPACITY THREATENS U.S. RESPONSE \u2014 Federal officials are also scrambling to avert a public health crisis and reduce the odds of a full-fledged coronavirus outbreak.\n\nCDC announced the first potential case of community spread in Northern California on Wednesday night, shortly after President Donald Trump addressed the nation on the outbreak. A hospital memo revealed that stringent federal rules prevented testing of the patient for a full week, despite multiple requests by doctors.\n\nPublic health laboratories have faced widespread challenges verifying CDC\u2019s emergency diagnostic, and only a handful are actively testing for the virus. The agency\u2019s Atlanta headquarters is only able to test 350 to 500 samples a day, according to agency Director Robert Redfield.\n\nThe CDC chief said that other countries have been able to expand screening faster than the United States, blaming the delay on federal regulations that govern tests developed in-house by hospitals and laboratories. Redfield also said that FDA has been supportive of efforts to boost testing, POLITICO\u2019s Brianna Ehley reports.\n\nThe Association of Public Health Laboratories told POLITICO that even if all public health labs were able to test for the virus using the CDC diagnostic, they would only be able to analyze about 100 tests per day. That raises questions about whether the United States would be able to screen enough suspected cases in a large outbreak.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t looked widely enough to believe that it is not here outside the known cases,\u201d said Marc Lipsitch, an epidemiology professor at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. \u201cChina tested 320,000 people in Guangdong over a three-week period. This is the scale we need to be thinking on,\u201d he added.\n\nCDC EXPANDS TESTING CRITERIA \u2014 Redfield told lawmakers Thursday that doctors nationwide will now be allowed to screen anyone they suspect is infected with coronavirus.\n\nEarlier CDC criteria limited testing to people experiencing symptoms who had traveled from affected countries or had been in contact with someone known to have the virus.\n\nMORE CAPACITY ON THE WAY? \u2014 HHS Secretary Alex Azar told lawmakers Thursday at least 40 labs should now be able to test for coronavirus after FDA authorized a modified version of CDC\u2019s diagnostic.\n\nBut APHL senior director of public policy Peter Kyriacopoulos said it will likely take days for those labs to get testing up and running.\n\n\u201cThey are now working through the process of making certain that the science works in each of their operations, which is exactly what you want to do,\u201d Kyriacopoulos said.\n\nFDA appears open to allowing labs to use a shared laboratory developed test under a standard protocol, according to a letter Commissioner Stephen Hahn sent to APHL.\n\nThe public health labs still must submit the test to FDA for review, according to the agency \u2014 which says the law requires it to evaluate such tests in emergency situations.\n\n\u201cFDA has developed a template to streamline the process to facilitate the protocol that you propose while ensuring FDA\u2019s appropriate oversight,\u201d Hahn wrote in the letter.\n\nDiagnostic maker Qiagen confirmed to POLITICO that it plans to ask FDA to grant an emergency use authorization for its coronavirus diagnostic by Monday at the latest.\n\nAZAR: WE CAN\u2019T CONTROL A CORONAVIRUS VAX\u2019S COST, BUT WE\u2019ll TRY \u2014 HHS Secretary Alex Azar said in a congressional hearing this week that the government can\u2019t promise an affordable coronavirus vaccine when one eventually launches (which NIAID\u2019s Anthony Fauci says is still at least a year away).\n\n\u201cWe would want to ensure that we work to make it affordable, but we can\u2019t control that price because we need the private sector to invest,\u201d Azar told the House Energy and Commerce committee Wednesday. The secretary softened his approach in a Ways and Means hearing the next day, telling lawmakers that the administration would \u201cwork to ensure that there are appropriate protections\u201d to make federally funded vaccines \u2014 like the Moderna product with NIH, or the BARDA-funded Johnson & Johnson candidate \u2014 affordable.\n\nDrug pricing advocates and Democrats remain unimpressed. Any potential coronavirus vaccine \"should be available to everyone, not dependent on 'Big Pharma,\u2019\u201d Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in a press conference Thursday.\n\nThe U.S. government is driving coronavirus vaccine research, Public Citizen president Robert Weissman pointed out in a statement that called for the government to commit to nonexclusive licensing of whatever vaccine is developed.\n\nIt\u2019s \u201cnot just a matter of justice and avoiding profiteering, it\u2019s a matter of public health urgency,\u201d said Weissman. \u201cIf the vaccine is not made affordable around the world, then it won\u2019t work to stop what could turn into a global pandemic.\u201d\n\nINDUSTRY: WE\u2019RE DONATING COMPOUNDS, SUPPLIES IN CORONAVIRUS FIGHT \u2014 Drugmakers have donated compounds with the potential to treat coronavirus for emergency use and research, along with much-needed medical supplies, drug industry lobby PhRMA said this week. Several companies are also at work on vaccines or treatments, including Moderna, J&J and Gilead.\n\nPhRMA also said that its members are working hard to prevent or mitigate potential drug shortages, and have partnered with both U.S. and Chinese health agencies to focus on research that could speed up development of coronavirus therapies.\n\nIn Congress\n\nSENATORS WARN OPTUM TO COMPLY WITH INSULIN PROBE \u2014 Pharmacy benefit manager Optum is trying to wave off the Senate Finance Committee\u2019s investigation into high insulin prices by providing only information that\u2019s already public, Chairman Chuck Grassley and ranking member Ron Wyden wrote to the company this week.\n\n\u201cOptum\u2019s unwillingness to provide the documents we requested fits an industry-wide pattern of fighting efforts to shed light on PBMs\u2019 practices,\u201d the senators said.\n\n\"We have provided thousands of pages of documents in response to the Committee\u2019s request, and will continue to work with them on this important issue,\" a spokesperson said.\n\nEye on FDA\n\nFDA GETS AN EARFUL ON AI REGULATION \u2014 How should FDA regulate AI in radiology? Very carefully, if you believe experts and industry representatives who spoke at a workshop on Tuesday. The performance of AI can depend tremendously on context \u2014 say, whether a polyp is flat or raised, said Ronald Summers, a senior radiology scientist at NIH. The results may be unexplainable, and AI systems can be brittle \u2014 lacking consistency across datasets or different types of imaging hardware.\n\nOne big conundrum stems from how health systems deploy AI to read images. They can set error thresholds lower \u2014 and run the risk of false negatives \u2014 or high, producing more false positives that human radiologists will have to carefully examine, which sort of undercuts the whole purpose.\n\nThere will be pressure to set them high, said Keith Dreyer, chief data scientist at Partners Health. \u201cIt\u2019s not unreasonable to expect superhuman performance from AI,\u201d he added, because \u201ceach false negative could represent a loss of life.\u201d\n\nDespite the poor job that some radiologists do at reading mammograms, for example, \u201cwe may be more comfortable with human error than we would be with computer error,\u201d said Constance Lehman, chief of breast imaging at Massachusetts General Hospital.\n\nThere were optimists in the crowd as well. Software will produce bad results sometimes, but clinicians can catch them, said Bibb Allen, chief medical officer of the American College of Radiology\u2019s Data Science Institute. Judgement, after all, is the humans\u2019 job. \u201cAI is kind of like my dog,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty non-judgmental.\u201d\n\nIn the Courts\n\nSTATES PUSH BACK ON POSSIBLE LAWYER FEES IN OPIOID SUIT \u2014 Thirty-seven state attorneys general warned this week that a push for more money by lawyers leading mass litigation against drug firms for their alleged roles in the opioid epidemic may be thwarting hope of a global settlement. The Monday letter is the latest sign of tensions as a broad swath of states press for a global settlement with the nation\u2019s three main drug distributors and Johnson & Johnson.\n\nThe letter rejected a proposal from municipalities\u2019 lead attorneys, who last month asked the presiding judge to impose a 7 percent fee for their work. The AGs argue states might have to pay into this fund, spending money on attorney fees they could otherwise use to fight the epidemic.\n\nJudge Dan Polster is overseeing thousands of lawsuits that have been consolidated in his Ohio district court.\n\nThe lead attorneys say AGs\u2019 concerns are based on a misunderstanding of how the fund would work and hope to talk with the states about their concerns.\n\nElsewhere: the nation\u2019s largest generics opioids maker, Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals, announced a $1.6 billion settlement deal, agreed upon by all the disparate parties.\n\nDrug Pricing\n\nICER REVISES MIGRAINE REPORT, BUT ADVOCACY GROUPS STILL NOT SATISFIED \u2014 The Institute for Clinical and Economic Review revised its previous assessment of two new migraine drugs, determining that they meet its long-term cost-effectiveness thresholds \u2014 after previously ruling the cost of the medicines was too high. The final evidence report concluded that Allergan\u2019s Ubrelvy, which costs $4,896 a year, and Biohaven\u2019s rimegepant meet the cost-effectiveness threshold.\n\nBiohaven\u2019s drug is still under review by FDA and doesn\u2019t have a list price. Because rimegepant is the same type of treatment as Ubreelvy, ICER assumed its price will be comparable. The report also found that Eli Lilly\u2019s Lasmiditan, which costs $4,610 a year, is not cost-effective.\n\nThe revised analysis of Allergan and Biohaven\u2019s drugs came after ICER \u201cwork[ed] closely with Allergan to identify high-quality evidence demonstrating additional clinical benefits for ubrogepant beyond the two-hour time point required by the FDA for the clinical trials.\u201d The trials submitted for approval compared the drugs to placebo two hours after patients took the medicine.\n\nUse older meds first: Despite the revised cost-effectiveness assessments ICER says it would be \u201creasonable\u201d for insurers to require prior authorization for these drugs, since they did not demonstrate superiority to older, less-expensive medicines. ICER encouraged the companies to conduct long-term trials that directly compare the migraine treatments as the clinical trials of the new drugs compared the medicines to placebo.\n\nICER has experienced a lot of pushback from the drug industry and patient groups who argue the assessments don\u2019t fully consider the various benefits of a drug. The new ICER assessment drew mixed reviews from two migraine focused groups \u2014 the Coalition for Headache and Migraine Patients and Headache & Migraine Policy Forum. \u201cWe continue to have concerns that the ICER approach under-counts the real economic costs of migraine disease and under-values the benefits of these new medicines,\u201d they said. They are pushing ICER to analyze the drugs again using a framework the group is switching to that will place greater weight on societal benefits of a drug.\n\nMEDICAL DEVICES\n\nFDA WANTS WARNING FOR GYNECOLOGIC SURGERY TOOL \u2014 Labeling materials for laparoscopic power morcellators should contain a boxed warning that the devices can spread cancer during fibroid surgery and decrease patients\u2019 long-term survival, FDA said in a draft guidance Wednesday.\n\nThe agency also updated its 2014 safety communication this week, adding a recommendation to only use the devices with a tissue containment system.\n\nNEW ELECTRONIC 510(k) TEMPLATE \u2014 CDRH Director Jeff Shuren announced Wednesday that device manufacturers will soon be able to apply to a participate in a pilot of an electronic submission template for the most common type of medical device application. Nine companies will be selected for the pilot.\n\n\u201cThis highly-interactive submission template is intended to allow manufacturers to provide information to the FDA that\u2019s complementary to CDRH internal review templates currently used to review 510(k)s, allowing us to receive information and evaluate the submission more efficiently and consistently,\u201d Shuren said in a statement.\n\nQuick Hits\n\nGOODRX SHARED CUSTOMER DATA WITH SOCIAL MEDIA GIANTS \u2014 There is a potentially big trade-off to using the GoodRx app to shop drug prices \u2014 the company is sharing customer data with Facebook, Google and others, writes Consumer Reports\u2019 Thomas Germain. The price comparator has sent personal details about consumers\u2019 prescription searches to more than 20 internet-based companies, Germain reports. GoodRx said after the article was published that it planned to stop sharing personal medical details with companies and had appointed a new head of data privacy.\n\nPharma Moves\n\nPfizer\u2019s Upjohn Division CFO Sanjeev Narula will be CFO of its new joint venture with Mylan, Viatris.

Or at least own mutual funds. Who knows, people could say you\u2019re gaming an index fund,\u201d Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) told POLITICO this week.\n\nIn 2017, Burr traded stock in two companies that make medical devices, Zimmer Biomet and Philips, while introducing bills to repeal the medical device tax and working to repeal Obamacare.\n\nHe invested in financial institutions including the Bank of New York Mellon and U.S. Bank, which are regulated by the Senate Finance Committee, on which he sits.\n\nAs the finance committee debated the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, Burr held stock in multinational conglomerate Kimberly-Clark, owner of Kleenex, which owns brands in Mexico.\n\nAs tensions rose in 2019 with China, he picked up stock in 3M, another multinational whose purchases and sales with China were affected by President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs, which also fall under the finance committee's jurisdiction.\n\nBurr\u2019s investments in health care have repeatedly overlapped with the work of the Senate HELP Committee, on which he also sits. He owns stock in Avanos Medical, a medical technology and device company that has a specialty in reducing opioid use among people with pain issues \u2014 a topic that has been front-and-center in recent years for HELP Committee lawmakers. Congress eventually passed a major opioid bill in the fall of 2018 that, among other things, sought to advance research in non-opioid pain treatments. Burr also owns stock in pharmaceutical companies such as AbbVie.\n\nThis week, the FBI served Burr a search warrant for his phone, the latest step in an investigation into whether Burr\u2019s abrupt sale of hundreds of thousands of dollars in stocks this spring was influenced by private information he gleaned as chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee. Federal probes into Burr\u2019s trades, as well as trades by Sen. Kelly Loeffler (R-Ga.) and the husband of Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), have shaken Capitol Hill and left some lawmakers in both parties wondering if the practice should be barred.\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who has proposed legislation that would ban lawmakers from owning stock in individual companies, said, \u201cThe American people should never wonder whether or not the top officials in this government are working for them or are working for their own personal financial gain.\u201d\n\nBurr\u2019s Senate office declined to comment, as did a spokesperson for his legal team.\n\nAfter initial news of the stock sales broke, Burr defended the sales.\n\n\u201cI relied solely on public news reports to guide my decision regarding the sale of stocks on February 13. Specifically, I closely followed CNBC\u2019s daily health and science reporting out of its Asia bureaus at the time,\u201d Burr said in a statement on March 20.\n\nBut Burr has long held stocks in companies that have business before his committees, creating the possibility that he could learn nonpublic information that has to do with his stock portfolio.\n\nWhile Congress has barred most executive branch employees from holding stocks that pose a similar conflict of interest with their work, Congress has not put similar limits on itself, said Richard Painter, a former White House ethics lawyer and candidate for the Senate.\n\n\u201cIt would be a crime for almost anyone in the executive branch to have medical device stock and weigh in on the medical device tax,\u201d Painter said.\n\nThe practice is not uncommon in the House and Senate. While some lawmakers chose to hold only mutual funds or put their stocks into a blind trust in order to avoid potential conflicts of interest, others buy and trade stocks despite past public outcry about them doing so.\n\nIn 2012, outrage over lawmakers\u2019 stock trades \u2014 and their participation in lucrative initial public offerings \u2014 led Congress to pass the STOCK Act, which explicitly banned insider trading among lawmakers and required them to publicly disclose their trades online for the first time, allowing reporters and the public to see transactions such as Burr\u2019s swift stock dump before the coronavirus panic.", "link": "https://www.politico.com/news/2020/05/15/burrs-alleged-conflicts-extend-beyond-his-coronavirus-related-stock-trades-261523", "published": "2020-05-15T00:00:00", "author": ["Anita Kumar"]}, {"title": "It's the coronavirus, stupid", "text": "In the battle for the Senate, at least three Republican incumbents \u2014 Collins, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Montana Sen. Steve Daines \u2014 are running TV ads on the chamber\u2019s $2 trillion legislative response to the coronavirus outbreak. Collins ran PSA-style ads thanking first responders, and a campaign spokesperson said she is likely to run a future ad focused on provisions for workers and small businesses in the Senate\u2019s bill.\n\nGideon, the Maine Democrat, and Amy McGrath, who is challenging McConnell, have also shifted their TV ads to coronavirus response messages. Gideon and an allied group, the nonprofit Majority Forward, have touted her state legislative response. McGrath, in an ad filmed in her home with her family in the background, pointed to a sign-up on her campaign website highlighting charitable donations. McGrath\u2019s campaign also released a new attack ad Friday in which a narrator accuses McConnell of \u201ctaking a victory lap\u201d on the response to the coronavirus.\n\nIn West Virginia, Democratic and Republican candidates for governor alike are running ads about the impact of the virus. In one, filmed from a doctor\u2019s office, Democrat (and primary care physician) Ron Stollings asks viewers to \u201cassume everyone has the coronavirus\u201d to compel them to wash their hands regularly and practice social distancing.\n\nIn a show of allegiance to Trump, Texas congressional candidate Kathaleen Wall released an ad on Wednesday that blames the spread of Covid-19 on China\u2019s government and bolsters the president's reference to it as \"the Chinese virus.\" She highlights points of her platform in the ad that run in tandem with Trump's: ending trade with China and manufacturing goods in the United States.\n\nBut most of these campaigns were already airing TV ads before coronavirus collided with the campaign, and other campaigns have held off on launching TV ads, for now.\n\nSteven Law, president of Senate Leadership Fund, the top Republican super PAC focused on Senate races, said that with voters hyper-focused on coronavirus news updates, it\u2019s challenging for any political message to have an impact. SLF and its sister nonprofit, One Nation, which has spent huge sums in a handful of races so far, are not currently airing ads in any states after several recent ad campaigns ended.\n\n\"I just think it's hard to cut through the clutter,\u201d Law said in an interview. \u201cPeople may see your ad, but they're really going to focus on what they see on the news and what they are able to see as actual activity that impacts their lives.\"\n\nOn the campaign side, strategists noted that most candidates have limited media budgets, and fundraising could prove challenging with in-person events on hiatus. That means dropping big money for TV buys that might not break through the noise would be wasteful.\n\n\u201cIt's taken over everything and yet campaigns and candidates are still carefully thinking through how to talk about it, and whether it needs to be talked about directly,\u201d said Russell, who works with a number of down-ballot candidates. \u201cYou don't want to put a message out there that you aren't sure is going to land right.\u201d\n\nThere are also practical challenges to airing ads right now. New media shoots can\u2019t be scheduled because of travel limitations, and social distancing means candidates can\u2019t be filmed in gatherings with voters or constituents. Even b-roll footage of those interactions that was already filmed could look awkward at a time when no one is conducting in-person campaign events.\n\nCollins\u2019 recent ad was shot with a two-person crew in an empty studio, according to her spokesman. McGrath\u2019s ad was shot by a single staffer in her home, with her family in the background, her campaign said. New shots of interactions with voters are off the table \u2014 and old b-roll of those interactions may appear at odds with current distancing guidelines.\n\n\u201cYou don't know what happens if you air an ad that's on coronavirus, if that's in bad taste. If you air an ad that's not on coronavirus, if that's in bad taste,\u201d said one Democratic media consultant. \u201cIf you can afford to wait, you wait.\u201d\n\nSome outside groups aren\u2019t holding off on new advertising, though.

FEMA and other agencies, despite years of emergency preparation, were not equipped for the unprecedented task of a pandemic that impacted all 50 states, they said. \u2026\n\n\u201cAt least one tip the volunteers forwarded turned into an expensive debacle. In late March, according to emails obtained by The Times, two of the volunteers passed along procurement forms submitted by Yaron Oren-Pines, a Silicon Valley engineer who said he could provide more than 1,000 ventilators.\n\n\u201cMr. Kushner\u2019s volunteers passed the tip to federal officials who then sent it to senior officials in New York, who assumed Mr. Oren-Pines had been vetted and awarded him an eye-popping $69 million contract. Not a single ventilator was delivered, and New York is now seeking to recover the money.\u201d\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

Despite the [American Investment Council\u2019s] lobbying for a loosening of restrictions, most private equity firms -- which buy companies using large amounts of debt that they then load onto those companies\u2019 balance sheets -- will still be shut out because of a rule included in the program.\u201d\n\nBURGESS EVERETT BURSTS THE PAYROLL BUBBLE: \u201cTrump\u2019s tax cut dreams hit Republican resistance\u201d: \u201cPresident Donald Trump\u2019s demands for the next coronavirus aid package are running into a stubborn obstacle: his own party.\n\n\u201cAsked what he thought of a payroll tax cut, the subject of Trump\u2019s ultimatum for any new bill, Sen. Chuck Grassley didn't hesitate. \u2018Right now, not much,\u2019 the Senate Finance Committee chairman said, worrying that the tax cut could drain retirement funds or leave older Americans with the view that Congress doesn\u2019t take \u2018seriously\u2019 the plight of the Social Security Trust Fund.\n\n\u201c\u2018I\u2019m going to give it due consideration, if I can see a strong group of people who think it\u2019s the right thing to do,\u2019 added Grassley (R-Iowa), whose committee handles federal tax policy. But he said the president\u2019s preference wouldn\u2019t be the last word -- a sentiment shared by many in the Senate GOP: \u2018The president proposes, we dispose.\u2019\u201d\n\n-- THEO MEYER: \u201cChamber, trial lawyers group each say public is on their side in coronavirus liability fight\u201d\n\nNEW -- Due to the pandemic, the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund for the first time will livestream its annual candlelight vigil on May 13, via Verizon.

Announcement video\n\nALICE MIRANDA OLLSTEIN and ADAM CANCRYN: \u201cWhile Trump touted reopening, his team was sounding alarms\u201d: \u201cPresident Donald Trump boasted on May 1 that his success in responding to the coronavirus pandemic has made ventilator, test kit and mask shortages a thing of the past, and that much of the country is ready to quickly send people back to work. \u2018We\u2019ve ensured a ventilator for every patient who needs one,\u2019 he said. \u2018The testing and the masks and all of the things, we\u2019ve solved every problem. We solved it quickly.\u2019\n\n\u201cBut that same day, his own health and emergency management officials were privately warning that states were still experiencing shortages of masks, gowns and other medical gear, according to a recording of an interagency meeting between FEMA and HHS officials across the country, conducted by conference call, which was obtained by POLITICO.\u201d POLITICO\n\nELENA SCHNEIDER and JAMES ARKIN: \u201cCandidates morph into Covid-19 relief workers \u2014 and want you to know about it\u201d: \u201cClayton Fuller was filming his first campaign ad for Congress when he got a call from his Air National Guard commanding officer: He was being activated for coronavirus duty.\n\n\u201cNow the Republican from Georgia is spending his days far away from the campaign trail, coordinating the cleaning of nursing and veterans\u2019 homes in Alabama. But because he\u2019s under federal orders, he can no longer ask for votes himself \u2014 this week, he\u2019s missing two virtual candidate forums. \u2018I\u2019m not allowed to talk to him,\u2019 said David O\u2019Connell, Fuller\u2019s campaign manager, who cited Department of Defense regulations that barred active duty service members from political actions. \u2018But the campaign\u2019s had to go on without him.\u2019\n\n\u201cFuller represents an extreme example of how the coronavirus has transformed elections up and down the ballot. With electioneering largely on hold, campaigns are adapting in fundamental ways \u2014 many morphing into mini-relief organizations by channeling their donor and volunteer bases into coronavirus-related work in their communities.\n\n\u201cThe candidates are raising big money for relief, but in many cases are making sure voters know about their good deeds, now and in the run-up to November.\u201d POLITICO\n\n-- MEANWHILE: \u201cKelly Loeffler embraces her wealth -- and private jet -- to jump-start campaign,\u201d by Marianne LeVine and James Arkin: \u201cRepublican Kelly Loeffler is leaning on one of her greatest assets and most glaring liabilities to jump-start her campaign: her money.\n\n\u201cThe Georgia senator, facing declining poll numbers and ongoing scrutiny over controversial stock trades, this week launched a $4 million ad campaign highlighting ways she\u2019s used her wealth for Covid aid efforts in her state. Those include donating her salary, deploying her private plane to help transport stranded cruise ship passengers and making a $1 million personal donation to a relief organization, along with her support of the Senate's legislative responses.\n\n\u201cThe trio of TV ads, by far the largest paid media from her or any other candidates in the race, comes after weeks of criticism and attacks that badly damaged her nascent campaign.\u201d POLITICO\n\nUPDATE: \u201cFederal judge orders officials to restore New York primary, drawing cheers from Sanders camp,\u201d by WaPo\u2019s Sean Sullivan and David Weigel\n\nA message from Google: Grow with Google OnAir offers free virtual workshops, events and 1:1 coaching sessions to teach small businesses and job seekers digital skills.

Greg Abbott to reopen salons,\u201d by Cassandra Pollock and Stacy Fern\u00e1ndez: \u201cOn Tuesday, state Reps. Steve Toth and Briscoe Cain sat wearing barbers\u2019 gowns in a Houston-area salon, ready for their haircuts. Both Republicans were breaking state law by doing so, but to them, it mattered no less \u2014 one was there to send a message to Gov. Greg Abbott, and the other was there as an act of civil disobedience.\n\n\u201c\u2018A little less on the sides,\u2019 Toth, from The Woodlands, told the hairstylist while on the phone with a Texas Tribune reporter, noting that \u2018there's absolutely no reason\u2019 why such businesses couldn't reopen their doors under proper health guidelines during the coronavirus pandemic. \u2018I think these businesses need to be open,\u2019 Cain, from Deer Park, told Fox 26 while getting his haircut.\n\n\u201cHours later, their wish was granted: Abbott announced that hair salons and barber shops were among the businesses that could begin to reopen Friday \u2014 several days earlier than he had previously signaled.\u201d\n\nACROSS THE POND -- \u201cGovernment scientist Neil Ferguson resigns after breaking lockdown rules to meet his married lover,\u201d by The Daily Telegraph: \u201cThe scientist whose advice prompted Boris Johnson to lock down Britain resigned from his Government advisory position on Tuesday night as The Telegraph can reveal he broke social distancing rules to meet his married lover. \u2026 The epidemiologist leads the team at Imperial College London that produced the computer-modelled research that led to the national lockdown, which claimed that more than 500,000 Britons would die without the measures.\u201d\n\nBETSY WOODRUFF SWAN and DANIEL LIPPMAN: \u201cICE chief tangles with White House over political appointees\u201d: \u201cThe acting chief of Immigration and Customs Enforcement is resisting a White House effort to install a number of political appointees at the agency he helms, according to three current and former U.S. officials who described the situation to POLITICO.\n\n\u201cThe battle comes as the powerful head of the White House Presidential Personnel Office, John McEntee, pushes hard to place Trump allies in key positions throughout the government. McEntee, a 29-year-old former campaign staffer who has the president\u2019s ear, is turning his focus to immigration as the 2020 election approaches. But the effort has faced resistance from Matthew Albence, a career law enforcement officer and ICE\u2019s acting director.\n\n\u201cAccording to the officials, the White House has spent about two months vetting a short list of candidates for open positions at ICE. The personnel office assembled the list\u2013\u2013which included potential candidates for chief of staff and Office of Policy director \u2014 and then, in consultation with the top two DHS officials, Chad Wolf and Ken Cuccinelli, brought the names of the candidates to ICE.\n\n\u201cBut Albence resisted the White House push. The effort has now slowed, according to one senior administration official, and it\u2019s unclear if or when the people on the list will get jobs at ICE.\u201d POLITICO\n\nA message from Google: Attend free online digital skills workshops and 1:1 sessions with Google employees.

Illinois, which had fiscal problems before the coronavirus, tops the list with an $11 billion request in May and June.\n\n\u201cCalifornia, the first state to borrow, plans to seek the next-highest amount over the same two months: $8 billion. Texas will ask for advances totaling $6.4 billion in May, June and July and New York will ask for $4.4 billion in the same three months. Connecticut, Hawaii, Massachusetts, Ohio and West Virginia have also signaled an intent to borrow between May and July to fund their unemployment systems. Some of the states, like Illinois and California, only requested advances for May and June.\n\n\u201cThere is no approval process for the advances, a department spokesperson said. States notify the Departments of Labor and Treasury of their needs, the spokesperson said, and the Department of Labor certifies those amounts to the Treasury Department. States are able to draw down advances as they need them, but won't necessarily end up using the full amounts.\u201d POLITICO California\n\nREALITY CHECK -- \u201cStruggles in India, Brazil, U.S. show virus fight far from won,\u201d by AP\u2019s Chris Blake in Bangkok: \u201cEven as countries moved forward Wednesday with easing their coronavirus restrictions and restarting their economies, a large cluster of infections linked to a market in India and the first lockdown of a major Brazilian city highlighted that the battle against the pandemic was far from won. \u2026\n\n\u201cIn India, which partly eased its lockdown Monday, health authorities were rushing to contain an outbreak of the virus at one of Asia\u2019s largest markets for perishable goods. The market in the southern city of Chennai, spread over more than 250 acres, had remained open throughout the lockdown and is now tied to at least 1,000 cases.\n\n\u201cAnother 7,000 people connected to now-shuttered Koyambedu market were being traced and quarantined, a huge task given that the facility is critical to the food supply across Tamil Nadu and neighboring states.\u201d\n\nBUSINESS BURST -- \u201cDisney Takes $1.4 Billion Hit to Earnings as Coronavirus Takes Hold,\u201d by WSJ\u2019s Erich Schwartzel\n\n-- \u201cAirbnb to Cut 25% of Workforce as Coronavirus Stalls Global Travel,\u201d by WSJ\u2019s Rolfe Winkler: \u201cAirbnb Inc. said it is slashing 1,900 jobs, or a quarter of its workforce, and cutting investments in noncore operations, as the home-sharing giant predicted the coronavirus pandemic would change its business even after more people start traveling again.\n\n\u201cCo-founder and Chief Executive Brian Chesky told employees about the cuts in a memo Tuesday, adding that the company\u2019s revenue forecast for this year is \u2018less than half\u2019 of last year\u2019s level. \u2018We are collectively living through the most harrowing crisis of our lifetime, and as it began to unfold, global travel came to a standstill,\u2019 Mr. Chesky told employees in a memo Tuesday. \u2018Airbnb\u2019s business has been hit hard.\u2019\u201d WSJ\n\nCOURT WATCH -- \u201cDuncan Hunter may delay prison term until 2021 due to coronavirus,\u201d by Jeremy B. White in Oakland: \u201cFormer Rep. Duncan Hunter could wait to serve a prison term until 2021 as coronavirus upends the corrections system. Hunter was sentenced to 11 months earlier this year after the San Diego Republican pleaded guilty to violating campaign finance law by spending campaign funds on personal matters.\n\n\u201cAt the time of his March sentencing, U.S. District Judge Thomas Whelan said Hunter was not required to surrender until May given the pervasive threat of infection. \u2026 Attorneys for Hunter and the government filed a motion on Tuesday to push back Hunter's report date until January 2021. In exchange, Hunter would not seek to modify his term or claim that his home confinement counted toward the 11-month prison stint.\n\n\u201c\u2018The parties submit this extension is appropriate due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the unknown impacts the disease will have in the coming months,\u2019 the filing says.\u201d POLITICO\n\nMEDIAWATCH -- HOWARD FINEMAN in WAPO: \u201cMy former newspaper is struggling \u2014 and is more important than ever\u201d\n\nPLAYBOOKERS\n\nSend tips to Eli Okun and Garrett Ross at [email protected].\n\nWHITE HOUSE ARRIVAL LOUNGE, via Anita Kumar and Daniel Lippman: Chad Gilmartin has been named principal assistant White House press secretary, according to two sources familiar with the move.

While the president sometimes begins more than half an hour late, after pushing the 5 p.m. start back by half an hour, he kept reporters waiting only nine more minutes.\n\nThere was no touting of unproven remedies, no swipes at political foes; only prediction of a swift economic rebound, praise for governors who are rolling out plans to reopen their states and updates on his administration's public health and economic response to the crisis that has killed more than 50,000 Americans.\n\nFriday\u2019s briefing also lacked the president\u2019s sparring with reporters that have become a briefing trademark that Trump clearly relishes. Those extended Q&A\u2019s with reporters have also produced some of his most troublesome off-the-cuff remarks.\n\nThe sudden about-face comes after a day when the White House took grief for Thursday's briefing during which Trump asked his medical experts to look into the use of disinfectants and ultraviolet light on human coronavirus patients. His dangerous suggestion that patients could possibly ingest household disinfectants kicked off a day of conflicting explanations.\n\nIn the face of a nearly universal rebuke, the White House initially said Trump\u2019s comments had been taken out of context. At a coronavirus relief bill signing later in the day, the president told reporters he had meant the suggestion sarcastically to bait reporters. Trump made no mention of the controversy in his brief remarks Friday.", "link": "https://www.politico.com/news/2020/04/24/trumps-coronavirus-briefing-207563", "published": "2020-04-24T00:00:00", "author": []}, {"title": "Coronavirus drives up unemployment claims", "text": "\"Today\u2019s hurricane-sized increase is nothing compared to what we can expect in coming weeks,\" Heidi Shierholz, senior economist at the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute, said in a prepared statement. \"The full weight of this economic shock is still ramping up.\"\n\nThe only question is how long the bad times will last, and that will depend on how fast and how far the virus spreads.\n\nAccording to DOL, layoffs were concentrated in service related industries, as well as in transportation and warehousing.\n\nThe latest unemployment number covers claims filed during the week ending March 14. But reports from unemployment insurance offices around the country indicated the real explosion in claims began this past weekend, and continued unabated this week.\n\nIn Colorado, nearly 11,000 unemployment claims were filed Monday and Tuesday, compared to only 400 claims filed the previous Monday.\n\nIn New Jersey, 15,000 people applied for unemployment benefits on Monday, a number twelve times higher than normal levels. Pennsylvania was on track to see more than 100,000 claims on Monday and Tuesday, compared to 12,000 during first week of March. And in the 24 hours after Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz signed an emergency order Monday closing bars, restaurants and other public places, workers filed nearly ten times as many claims as during the entire week one year earlier.\n\nJacob Robbins, an assistant professor of economics at the University of Illinois at Chicago, who tracks unemployment insurance claims, estimated that in 14 states roughly 340,000 claims were made on March 16 and March 17 alone \u2014 more than fifty percent more than were reported nationwide during the previous week.\n\nThe surge in unemployment claims accompanied widespread reports of layoffs nationwide. New York-based Union Square Hospitality Group, which owns Gramercy Tavern and Union Square Cafe, laid off 80 percent of its workers. On Tuesday Marriott said it expects to lay off tens of thousands of workers worldwide.

His staff stood at a distance behind a rope.\n\nBernie Sanders, who like Trump has made rallies a staple of his insurgent campaign, has also ditched large events for now.\n\nThe Trump campaign had been eager for months to get the canceled Las Vegas fundraiser with Adelson on the books. The White House also scrapped what was to be first lady Melania Trump\u2019s first solo fundraiser, which had been scheduled for next week in Los Angeles, now placed under a state of emergency.\n\nBiden has also aborted upcoming fundraisers, including two in Chicago. The campaign said it would be holding its fundraisers online indefinitely.\n\nWhile the Trump campaign and its allies at the Republican National Committee are giving employees the option of teleworking, the Biden campaign has gone further. On Thursday, the former vice president\u2019s effort distributed an internal memo informing employees at its Philadelphia headquarters that beginning this weekend they are to work from home. Staffers scattered across the country, meanwhile, will have the option of working from their homes or from short-term housing rentals.\n\nThe Sanders campaign similarly announced Thursday that all staff are to work from home.\n\n(A Trump campaign official confirmed that it would be asking its employees who work at the Arlington, Va., headquarters to work at home March 13-16 while the office was sanitized.)\n\nField organizing, which of course can't be done entirely from home, has been made vastly more complicated by the outbreak. The RNC had been planning a National Week of Training next week \u2014 a nationwide effort to recruit and activate supporters and test the party\u2019s get-out-the-vote operation. While some of those gatherings were initially to be in person, they are now slated to be held online and over the phone. The committee is also planning an upcoming online training day for volunteers.\n\nAfter spending more than a year developing a massive digital infrastructure and database of contact information, the Trump campaign is betting it will be able to reach key voters online. The reelection effort recently set up a new website, ArmyforTrump.com, which is designed to be an online home for volunteers.\n\n\u201cThe Trump campaign is built on data and uses technology to its highest advantages, so is better positioned to virtually engage voters than any other campaign,\u201d said Tim Murtaugh, a Trump campaign spokesman.\n\n2020 Election Results Who\u2019s winning 2020?

In its Thursday memo, the campaign announced it is closing all field offices to the public and would instead be organizing \u201cvoters across the country through phone banking, text messaging, virtual events, and other distributed organizing models.\u201d\n\nDespite a series of key primaries taking place next week, the Sanders campaign said it would put a halt to all \u201cdoor-to-door canvasses, instead moving to digital formats and outreach wherever possible.\u201d\n\nWhile Trump advisers are worried about how the president\u2019s response to the coronavirus \u2014 and accompanying stock market crash \u2014 will affect his reelection hopes, they largely remain sanguine. But with schools and offices shutting down and people dying, they also said they recognized the accompanying political danger.\n\nPeople familiar with Wednesday\u2019s White House meeting said the president seemed to grasp the urgency of the situation.\n\nBiden is using the crisis as an opportunity to cast himself as a steady leader who will return the country to normalcy after a turbulent Trump presidency. During a Thursday speech on the outbreak, Biden charged that \u201cpublic fears are being compounded by a pervasive lack of trust in this president, fueled by his adversarial relationship with the truth.\u201d\n\nBiden then emphasized the need to embrace science, take the lead from experts, and be frank with the public \u2014 implying Trump has done the opposite.\n\n\u201cThe No. 1 question right now,\u201d said Ron Klain, a top Biden campaign adviser who coordinated the Obama administration\u2019s response to an Ebola outbreak in late 2014, \u201cis what\u2019s your response to this coronavirus?\u201d\n\n", "link": "https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/13/coronavirus-consumes-trumps-reelection-bid-127852", "published": "2020-03-13T00:00:00", "author": ["Michael Caputo", "Campaign Aide."]}, {"title": "Europe fears coronavirus second wave", "text": "She pointed to the recent resurgence in several Asian countries as a cautionary example.\n\nShe and other experts argue that easing lockdowns and restarting international travel could be the triggers for the next wave. Governments deciding testing strategies might also overlook marginalized people, often living in cramped or unsanitary conditions \u2014 which could also be a trigger.\n\nMeanwhile, planning for a post-pandemic world continues to be hampered by a long list of unanswered questions.\n\nScientists still don't know for sure whether those infected develop some sort of immunity and, if so, how long that lasts \u2014 or whether exposure to other coronaviruses, like those that cause the common cold, creates some sort of immunity against this one.\n\nThere have been hopes that warmer weather works against the virus' spread, but that, too, hasn't been established.\n\n\"New therapeutics, vaccines, or other interventions such as aggressive contact tracing and quarantine ... could alleviate the need for stringent social distancing to maintain control of the epidemic,\" wrote the authors of a study, published in mid-April, that looked at the dynamics of the coronavirus transmission until 2025.\n\nOtherwise, intermittent distancing may need to be maintained until 2022, they warn.\n\nFirst signs and a 100-year-old lesson\n\nThe immediate danger comes from the lifting of current lockdown measures, European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) chief Andrea Ammon told POLITICO.\n\nThe effort has almost halved the number of reported cases in the European Economic Area between April 9 and May 8, she said.\n\nIf these measures are lifted too quickly, without being accompanied by testing, contact tracing, physical distancing and hand-washing, \"then we can see the next wave pretty soon,\u201d she said.\n\nThe early signs may already be here.\n\nAfter easing some restrictions, Germany has seen an increase of the reproduction rate of the virus above 1, meaning that one infected person can pass the virus to more than one other person, effectively contributing to the exponential rise in the number of cases.\n\nAfter reopening schools and kindergartens, Denmark also recorded an increase in the rate, but it stayed under 1.\n\nMeanwhile, Belgium, which has just allowed households to host the same four people and stores to reopen, is keeping a close eye on how that relaxation impacts the number of cases.\n\n\"People are fed up with the lockdown,\" Vlieghe acknowledged. \"They want to live again, they want to meet up again, and it\u2019s going to be very tricky ... to keep doing this in a moderate way.\"\n\nThe 1918 Spanish flu pandemic has been an example of how easing lockdowns and allowing mass gatherings could cause a deadlier second wave.\n\n\"That\u2019s absolutely why we don\u2019t want to have mass events come back very quickly,\" she said.\n\nThe Czech Republic appears to be the most daring on that front so far, allowing events, weddings and church services with up to 100 people to take place again as of Monday.\n\nOne of the first countries in Europe to impose wearing face masks everywhere, the country has cast itself as a success in dealing with the outbreak.\n\nSweden has put forward another approach, as the only country in the EU that hasn't shut down public life. Anders Tegnell, Sweden\u2019s state epidemiologist, has warned that other countries that have imposed lockdowns could face more cases in a second wave, because fewer people have been exposed to the virus than in Sweden, he told the Financial Times.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean Sweden would reach herd immunity, where the virus stops spreading because fewer people are susceptible to it; it's still uncertain how long that immunity lasts. But more people would be immune, he believes.\n\nAmmon, whose agency is hosted by Sweden, declined to comment on Stockholm\u2019s strategy.\n\nTravel dreams and Asian lessons\n\nThe pandemic couldn\u2019t have come at a worse time. Warm spring weather has made adherence to lockdown challenging, and the approaching summer has people wondering if they can go on holiday this year at all.\n\nThe risk noted by experts: Just as traveling back from ski trips spread the virus across Europe in February, vacationers coming back from beach holidays may usher in a new wave.\n\nThe idea of thousands of people crossing each other in airports and hotels \"is causing a lot of headaches\" to Vlieghe.\n\n\"So we have to think twice about opening borders, without any restrictions, too fast,\" she said. \"Because that will really bring us into trouble.\"\n\nStill, with so many tourism-dependent countries fretting to salvage part of the summer season, the European Commission is planning to publish recommendations on Wednesday on how to lift internal borders and allow for a safe resumption of passenger transport.\n\nGreek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, for example, hopes his country will be able to welcome tourists as of July, provided they test negative for an existing infection or positive for an antibody test that may hopefully mean they are immune to the virus.\n\nBut recent examples point to how difficult opening borders can be.\n\nTravel has been blamed for bringing new cases of infection in China, where the outbreak started. The country closed its borders in March to avoid importing cases from abroad, after imposing harsh lockdowns internally. But Chinese citizens returning from Russia, which is experiencing a spike in cases, have brought back the virus recently, said Fran\u00e7ois Godement, senior adviser for Asia at the Institut Montaigne in Paris.\n\nSouth Korea, seen as a model for using testing and contact tracing to contain the virus, may also offer a lesson in dealing with a second wave. On Saturday, it quickly closed bars and restaurants in Seoul after new infection clusters emerged.\n\nBefore that, Godement said, Japan was the only East Asian country hit by a second wave \u2014 in that case, as a recurrence of domestic cases. The setback led the government to impose a state of emergency and confine large cities.\n\nAs Godement sees it, the problem resulted from authorities making some of the same mistakes as Europe did initially: failing to implement measures on airport arrivals; doing little to no testing; and refusing to trace contacts due to privacy concerns.\n\nSingapore, by contrast, undertook those measures. But authorities overlooked the million migrant guest workers living in crowded dormitories. As the city-state was getting the infections in the community under control, the number in the dormitories exploded, notes Jeremy Lim, the co-director for global health at the National University of Singapore\u2019s School of Public Health.\n\nWith the workers interacting with the wider community every day by going out to jobs like street cleaning, the government had to impose a lockdown to reduce the contacts to a minimum, Lim said.\n\nBuilding the emergency exit\n\nEurope should learn from that lesson and watch for its urban poor, according to Lim.\n\nIreland appears to have recognized that risk, planning a greater focus on testing in marginalized groups in Dublin.\n\nMoreover, every public health agency in the world must continue pushing the message on hand washing, social distancing and wearing face masks, according to Lim.\n\nAnd countries shouldn't dismantle temporary hospitals, as \"it\u2019s still very early in the COVID story,\" he said.\n\nMeanwhile, Belgium\u2019s Vlieghe is already working on a plan for reconfinement, which she compares to an emergency exit of a building. The authorities will aim to detect infection clusters right away, she said, whether in schools, factories or villages. In turn, they can decide whether local or national measures should be imposed.\n\nThe important thing is to have the monitoring system in place to raise the alarm, something under construction in many other countries as well, she added.\n\nMeanwhile, there are ongoing concerns over the lack of protective equipment for health care workers, which isn't fully solved in many European countries. But it's improved since the early days of the pandemic, when countries didn\u2019t expect such a high number of cases, Ammon said.\n\nWith an eye on the risk of a second wave, governments across the Continent are still trying to ramp up the number of tests; introduce contact tracing apps; and increase capacity in intensive care units to deal with severe COVID-19 cases, she added.\n\nThe ECDC is also working on a model looking at the likely progression of the pandemic in each country, and how it will affect demand for medicines in different hospitals. Many had feared shortages of drugs such as painkillers and sedatives at the peak of the crisis in early April.\n\nThe European Commission, for its part, is still working on coordinating the joint procurement of protective equipment and ventilators. Brussels hasn't been successful in delivering them quickly to the countries most in need, but hopes they could still be used in future waves.\n\nSome strategic stocks of protective materials have now been built up and procedures are in place to deal with COVID-19 patients in the event of the next wave, Vlieghe said.\n\nBut because the outbreak has been so traumatizing and draining for the health care sector, \"it should absolutely not come too soon,\" she added.\n\nUntil a vaccine is developed, \"it will be a bit like driving and braking and driving and braking, and being careful,\" she said.", "link": "https://www.politico.com/news/2020/05/12/europe-fears-coronavirus-second-wave-250910", "published": "2020-05-12T00:00:00", "author": []}, {"title": "Coronavirus ends China's honeymoon in Africa", "text": "But that decadeslong quest for influence in Africa was gravely challenged last week when a group of disgruntled African ambassadors in Beijing wrote to Foreign Affairs Minister Wang Yi to complain that citizens from Togo, Nigeria and Benin living in Guangzhou, southern China, were evicted from their homes and made to undergo obligatory testing for Covid-19.\n\n\u201cIn some cases, the men were pulled out of their families and quarantined in hotels alone,\u201d the note, seen by POLITICO, said.\n\nThe incident, which caused widespread discontent both within Africa and among the diaspora after videos posted on social media showed people of African descent being evicted from their homes, resulting in a rare diplomatic showdown between Chinese and African officials.\n\nIt also broke a long-standing tradition of Africa voicing its problems with China \u2014 the continent\u2019s biggest trade partner \u2014 behind closed doors.\n\nIn one incident, Nigeria\u2019s speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, posted a video of himself summoning Chinese Ambassador Zhou Pingjian to his office where he expressed his displeasure about a Nigerian man being evicted from his home.\n\nWhile nobody expects China to lose its place as Africa\u2019s biggest bilateral lender and trade partner, analysts and African diplomats say there is a distinct possibility of lasting damage. Reluctance from China to endorse a G-20 decision to suspend Africa\u2019s debt payments until the end of the year has exacerbated the sense of frustration, they said.\n\n\u201cThere is a lot of tension within the relationship. I think both of these issues are the newest manifestations of long-term problems,\u201d said Cobus van Staden, a senior researcher at the South African Institute of International Affairs. \u201cAfrica\u2019s official response [to its citizens in China] took into account popular sentiment a lot more than it usually would have.\u201d\n\nSome scholars have documented how politicians in Africa have boosted their electoral base by mobilizing anti-Chinese sentiment, while many ordinary people perceive China\u2019s success in the region as a threat to their own well-being.\n\nAlthough China\u2019s government and the billionaire founder of the Alibaba Group, Jack Ma, have been among the most generous and eager members of the international community to assist Africa in fighting Covid-19, Beijing\u2019s overtaking of the World Bank as the biggest single lender to Africa has made it less inclined to write off the money it is owed. The Chinese government and the China Development Bank lent more than $150 billion to Africa between 2000 and 2018, according to the China Africa Research Initiative at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies.\n\nU.S. officials, including Tibor Nagy, assistant secretary for the U.S. State Department's Bureau of African Affairs, have strongly condemned the treatment of Africans in China, resulting in China snapping back at Washington by accusing it of sowing unnecessary discord between the pair.\n\nChinese officials have moved quickly to seal the emerging rift. Ambassador Liu Yuxi, Beijing\u2019s head of mission to the African Union, released a photo of himself giving a socially distanced elbow bump to his African counterpart \u2014 while distancing the Beijing government from the authorities in Guangzhou.\n\nAt the same time, Zhang Minjing, political counselor at the mission, downplayed the controversy in comments to POLITICO. Beijing had \u201cchampioned\u201d a debt initiative agreed upon by the G-20, he said, and is \u201ccommitted to taking all possible steps to support the poor.\u201d As for the recent tumult in Guangzhou, he said, \u201cthe rock-solid China-Africa Friendship will not be affected by isolated incidents.\u201d\n\n\u201cChina is against any differential treatment targeting any specific group of people. China and Africa are good brothers and comrades-in-arms. We are always there for each other come rain or shine,\u201d he added.\n\nBut there are also growing concerns in Beijing that its multibillion-dollar infrastructure projects in places such as Zimbabwe have now ground to a halt because of the coronavirus. Not only are engineering personnel unable to travel to the continent, but construction materials are running low as supply chains dry up.\n\nAfricans are going to need all the help they can get. After years of rapid growth, the International Monetary Fund on Wednesday said sub-Saharan Africa\u2019s gross domestic product would shrink this year by 1.6 percent due to the effects of the coronavirus, low oil prices and poor commodity prices. In Ethiopia alone, the government has estimated that 1.4 million jobs will be lost over the next three months, according to a document seen by POLITICO, roughly 3 percent of the workforce. Africa has recorded 17,701 coronavirus cases and 915 deaths \u2014 a toll that will likely climb rapidly, and likely underestimates the scale of the continent's predicament.\n\nSo far, the rest of the world has done little to help. On Monday, the IMF granted $215 million in initial debt relief to 25 African countries \u2014 a relative pittance compared with the vast sums those countries owe. On Wednesday, G-20 nations, which include China, the U.S., India and others, did offer to suspend debt payments until the end of 2020 despite calls from French President Emmanuel Macron to help African countries by \u201cmassively canceling their debt.\u201d\n\nBut Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, one of four special envoys to the African Union to solicit G-20 support in dealing with the coronavirus, said Africa was still \u201cpushing for more.\u201d In an interview, Okonjo-Iweala said she believed \u201cChina is coming along\u201d to provide Africa with debt relief across the board and not simply on a case-by-case basis. \u201cI don\u2019t believe it\u2019s against supporting African countries on this. I\u2019ve heard actually to the contrary,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat we need from China is not a case-by-case examination, but an across-the-board agreement.\u201d\n\nStephen Karingi, director of the trade division at the U.N.\u2019s Economic Commission for Africa, said support from the international community should be \u201cweighed against the damage Covid-19 will cause\u201d in Africa. \u201cWe think that 2020 and 2021 will be difficult and support should have that in mind or such a horizon,\u201d Karingi said.\n\nHow damaging the latest events will be to the political and commercial ties that have made China Africa\u2019s largest trading partner are unclear.\n\nOn the official level, there are signs that all will soon be forgotten. A senior African diplomat to the African Union, who spoke on the condition of anonymity due to the sensitive nature of the issue, said, \u201cWhen it comes to China, I doubt we will see long-term problems.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve got a lot invested on the continent, in the AU, in this city,\u201d the official added.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re everywhere. Realistically, I think it\u2019s important both sides understand why this is happening and try and resolve this mutually.\u201d\n\nStill, a host of African officials have made sure China does not get away lightly with its treatment of Africans living in China. Over the weekend, Moussa Faki, chairman of the African Union Commission, said he had \u201cinvited\u201d the Chinese ambassador to the AU to express his \u201cextreme concern\u201d for the situation, while Chinese ambassadors in Nigeria and Ghana were summoned to give an explanation.\n\nPresident Cyril Ramaphosa of South Africa said the ill treatment of African nationals in China was \u201cinconsistent with the excellent relations that exist between China and Africa, dating back to China\u2019s support during the decolonization struggle in Africa.\u201d\n\nA senior AU official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity due to the sensitive nature of the matter, said Chinese officials were particularly alarmed by the public dimension of the incident that exploded on social media. But, the official said, many African nations were pleased by remarks delivered by Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian on Sunday in which he underlined \u201cthe African side\u2019s reasonable concerns and legitimate appeals.\u201d\n\nWhether the people living on the continent forget so easily is another matter altogether.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be contentious among those communities for a lot longer,\u201d said van Staden of the South African Institute of International Affairs.", "link": "https://www.politico.com/news/2020/04/16/coronavirus-china-africa-191444", "published": "2020-04-16T00:00:00", "author": ["Simon Marks", "Kristine Lee"]}, {"title": "Inside Macron\u2019s coronavirus war", "text": "Since the first coronavirus case was detected in France on January 24, Macron and his team have been in a constant race with time, outpaced and outflanked at every turn, having to make critical decisions with incomplete and constantly evolving data about a virus the world\u2019s leading scientists are still struggling to fully understand.\n\nThis account of Macron\u2019s handling of the coronavirus crisis so far, based on interviews with seven senior officials involved in France\u2019s domestic and international response, reveals a president trying to juggle three different roles \u2014 as commander, communicator and multilateralist-in-chief.\n\nThe stakes are particularly high for the 42-year-old, who had never held elected office before he became French president less than three years ago.\n\nLike other national leaders, Macron is fighting to save lives and prevent an economic depression. But he is also battling for the survival of his political vision, built on European integration and international cooperation. That has been called into question by deep divisions within the EU, and the go-it-alone attitude of many countries.\n\nIn France\u2019s uniquely centralized presidential system, the buck unquestionably stops with Macron. He has addressed the nation three times since the crisis began, drawing a record television audience of 35 million for his first speech. In his most forceful address, he repeatedly told the French people they were \u201cat war.\u201d He will address them again on Monday evening, to discuss the next phase of the fight.\n\nYet while Macron has taken the role of commanding general, he has also cultivated more of a team approach to leadership than at other times in his presidency.\n\nIn their war so far, Macron and his troops have already suffered significant reverses. They have been accused of underplaying the usefulness of face masks and coronavirus tests because they knew France did not possess enough of either.\n\nMacron also pressed ahead with holding a first round of local elections in mid-March before having to cancel the second round as social distancing measures became stricter. And his considerable skills as a communicator have sometimes deserted him, leading to confusion.\n\nBut the president has so far won high marks from the French public for his leadership in the crisis \u2014 even though the state\u2019s overall handling of the pandemic is viewed more critically. His approval ratings shot up to their highest level in two years, even as a majority of French people say they think the government hid information and didn't communicate clearly.\n\nYet, despite nearly 9,000 coronavirus-related deaths in hospitals and almost 5,000 in care homes, France has succeeded in slowing the daily rise in fatalities and generally keeping critical care admissions to levels its hospitals can manage.\n\nIts generous social welfare system and a well-established partial work scheme has also helped curb some of the economic hardship.\n\nEven as they fight the virus, Macron and his team are also trying to think ahead to what comes next.\n\n\"We\u2019re quite obsessed with what happens after the crisis, including on the European level. No one knows what the day after will look like,\" said a senior Elys\u00e9e official. \"But we\u2019re not going to go back to the way things were, that would be surreal.\"\n\nOn Europe, Macron sees both danger and opportunity. The danger is that the European Union itself could collapse, particularly if countries hardest hit by the crisis such as Italy and Spain do not feel the EU has done enough to help them.\n\n\u201cThis solidarity issue isn\u2019t a gimmick, it is the condition of the survival of the European project in the aftermath,\u201d the senior official said.\n\nBut Macron also sees an opportunity to push through changes at the European level \u2014 from closer economic integration to greater EU powers on health policy.\n\n\u201cHe is very focused on making sure that the French people don\u2019t reject Europe as an entity that wasn\u2019t able to protect them and the Europeans,\" said St\u00e9phane S\u00e9journ\u00e9, a former key aide to Macron who is now a member of the European Parliament for the president\u2019s party and remains close to him. \"We need proof that the EU is useful and it can be useful on the sanitary response and the economic recovery afterward.\"\n\nThe French president\u2019s approach to the crisis rests on four pillars: building and leading his key team, communicating, decision-making and international cooperation.\n\nn the Green Salon, flanked by his most trusted aides around a boardroom table, Macron has spent the better part of the past five weeks in coronavirus video calls.\n\nNearly every week since the first deaths were recorded, he has also headed out to inspect his frontlines: at hospitals, research centers, crisis cells, a nursing home and a center for homeless people.\n\nHe has solemnly called for national unity in televised addresses, and sought to place himself above the fray, only answering a handful of questions from journalists.\n\nBut Macron is also sharing the spotlight more than in previous crises, such as the Yellow Jackets anti-government protests. He has surrounded himself with four lieutenants who have taken on key responsibilities and high-profile public roles \u2014 which may also mean less blame is attached to him personally if things go wrong.\n\nPrime Minister Edouard Philippe, his beard growing ever grayer, has spent hours on television fielding questions from viewers and breaking down the practicalities of the government's guidelines during lockdown.\n\nHe has also played a central role in arbitrating between the recommendations of the two inter-ministerial cells set up to manage the crisis: one at the health ministry in a room called CORRUSS, and the traditional crisis cell at the interior ministry, known for handling terror attacks. Both meet daily and incorporate recommendations from other ministries.\n\nDirector-General for Health J\u00e9r\u00f4me Salomon has become the government\u2019s leading expert voice, updating the public daily in televised press conferences on the number of confirmed cases and deaths.\n\n\u201cHe will be the Fran\u00e7ois Molins of health,\u201d Macron told his aides in late January, according to one of them, drawing a comparison with the former Paris prosecutor seen as a reassuring hand on the tiller as the country suffered a wave of terrorist attacks between 2015 and 2017.\n\nHealth Minister Olivier V\u00e9ran is another key member of the team, thrust into the role at short notice. In a puzzling move, Macron allowed then-Health Minister Agn\u00e8s Buzyn to resign and take on an uphill (and ultimately unsuccessful) run for Paris mayor after his party\u2019s original candidate, Benjamin Griveaux, had to quit over a sexting scandal.\n\nV\u00e9ran, a neurologist-turned member of parliament, took over on February 16, just a week before the first coronavirus-related death in France.\n\nHe quickly became a household name for his simple explanation of the strategy of flattening the pandemic curve to avoid overwhelming the health care system, drawing the curve live on television.\n\nBoth Salomon and V\u00e9ran had advised Macron\u2019s health task force during his presidential campaign. But the final member of the team was once a member of a rival camp. Like Prime Minister Philippe, Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire was a senior member of conservative party Les R\u00e9publicains but is now charged with crafting the Macron administration\u2019s response to what is expected to be the worst downturn since World War II.\n\nLe Maire has also been leading the economic charge internationally, proposing strategies and seeking to broker deals at the EU, G7 and G20 levels.\n\nike many leaders faced with widespread distrust of the political elite, Macron has stressed he is following the advice of scientists in the decisions he makes during the crisis. He set up a scientific council to advise him and the government on the coronavirus.\n\n\u201cOne principle guides us to define our actions,\u201d Macron said on March 12 in the first of his three televised speeches on the coronavirus. \u201cTrust in science. Listening to those who know.\u201d\n\nAn adviser in Macron\u2019s office stressed the importance of communications in their strategy. \u201cCommunication is one of the lifebloods of the war,\u201d said the adviser. \u201cBecause it\u2019s part of establishing trust. Without trust, everything you do has no value.\u201d\n\nBut on issues such as the use of masks and testing, authorities have not always leveled with the population \u2014 even when the shortages they faced were due in large part to decisions made by previous governments.\n\n\"We recommend that sick people wear masks and that transport workers and caregivers wear protective equipment,\" Salomon said in his daily press conference on January 27. That day, he also said that it was appropriate to \"systematically test\" any person with symptoms of the coronavirus.\n\nBut over the weeks that followed, as authorities realized their strategic reserve of masks would not be sufficient to cover everyone's needs, and that they did not have enough kits to systematically test the population, officials played down the importance of both for anyone but patients and health care workers.\n\nIn reality, France was woefully lacking the ability to test, because, unlike Germany, it doesn\u2019t produce kits locally, but relies on China for their main components, according to Jean-Francois Delfraissy, president of the scientific council advising authorities.\n\nThe lack of testing also weakened the government\u2019s case against a generalized wearing of masks. If people couldn\u2019t be tested to know whether they had the virus, wasn\u2019t it safer to wear a mask to lower the risk of spreading it? Complaints from medical staff and the public began to mount.\n\nIt was only on March 19 that V\u00e9ran admitted in response to a question in parliament that the government had a lower-than-expected stockpile of personal protective equipment.\n\n\"It was decided in 2011 and 2013 that there was no longer a need to keep massive stocks of masks, considering that factories could deliver quite quickly, namely in China,\u201d he said, urging that respirators and surgical masks be used with \u201cutmost parsimony.\u201d\n\nBy then, the government was increasing domestic mask production as it waited for the resumption of deliveries from China, amid a global race to secure supplies.\n\nTwo days later, V\u00e9ran was ushering in a slow change in the official strategy, saying the \"testing doctrine should evolve,\" after the World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said countries should \"test, test, test.\"\n\nAnd two weeks later, the message on masks shifted too. \u201cWe encourage members of the public, who would like to, to wear ... alternative masks that are being produced,\" Salomon said.\n\nThe waters were further muddied this week when V\u00e9ran balked at endorsing a general recommendation to wear masks.\n\nThree-quarters of the French think the government lied to them about masks, according to a poll published on April 9.\n\nince coming to office, Macron has cultivated a reputation for being bold and blunt. But he shied away from that template on two key measures, which dented his reputation.\n\nHis decision not to postpone local elections baffled many observers. The first round went ahead on Sunday, March 15, three days after he declared the country was \"facing the worst sanitary crisis in a century\" and ordered schools and kindergartens shut, and a day after Philippe ordered non-essential businesses to close down.\n\nMacron justified his decision on the basis of scientific advice that going to the polls carried no greater risk than running errands \u2014 as long as people practiced social distancing and used hand gels available at the polling station.\n\nCommentators warned that even if the first round could go ahead, there was a strong chance the second would have to be canceled as lockdown measures were tightened. Macron went ahead anyway.\n\nOfficials close to him later admitted that his calculations weren\u2019t purely about public health. They were also political.\n\nMacron\u2019s opponents, above all Les R\u00e9publicains (LR), had declared that the president would be staging a \u201ccoup d\u2019\u00e9tat\u201d if he canceled the elections. Macron\u2019s La R\u00e9publique en Marche party was trailing in the polls and projected to come in fourth nationwide.\n\nHaving faced the Yellow Jackets protests and, more recently, major public transport strikes over pension reform, Macron did not want to be painted as anti-democratic by canceling the election.\n\nOfficials say doubts about the election persisted even after Macron announced on Thursday March 12 that they would go ahead. But it was too late to change course.\n\n\u201cOn the Saturday [March 14], the prime minister knew there would be issues related to the second round of the election but you can\u2019t cancel on Saturday elections being held the next day,\u201d a government official said. The official said it would have been particularly hard to postpone when scientists had given the green light.\n\nThe elections went ahead the following day, and LREM performed as badly as expected, amid a historic low turnout of 45.5 percent.\n\nAnd that was not Macron\u2019s only problem around that time. On election day, Macron\u2019s wife Brigitte took a walk along the Seine river and was reportedly taken aback by the number of people out and about, despite Philippe's instructions the day before to limit movements to essential errands. Yet Brigitte Macron's own stroll also flouted the government's guidelines.\n\nThe following day, Macron announced a nationwide lockdown in his second address to the nation. But he avoided using the word \u201cconfinement,\u201d which had been widely expected. That left people confused about if and when they could leave their homes. The prime minister and interior minister had to clarify the rules in the days that followed.\n\nOfficials said Macron had been trying to strike a balance in his speech. \u201cIt was a complex message about needing to confine but also needing to keep the economic engine going,\u201d the adviser in his office said days later.\n\nHowever, more than many world leaders, Macron has been blunt about how little is known about the virus and about the need to find the right balance with economic imperatives, even if the pandemic subsides.\n\n\"We don\u2019t know how many waves we\u2019re going to have and how the virus is going to behave and how we will absorb it,\" he said on a visit to the Pasteur Institute in Paris on March 19.\n\n\"We are living through a profoundly new period that forces us to ask ourselves questions we haven't asked ourselves [about things] like supply and production chains,\" Macron said.\n\n\"We are going to change our habits, but everything can't stop ... we must take the time to organize ourselves, and see what is adaptable.\"\n\nn his suite in the King David Hotel in Jerusalem on January 22, Macron called his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping, an hour before kicking off an official visit to Israel and the Palestinian Territories. He called to express his best wishes for the Chinese New Year and also to discuss the coronavirus outbreak that China was experiencing.\n\nIt was his first of many international conversations about the virus. In the following month and a half, Macron has taken part in a veritable blitz of videoconferences aimed at shepherding a global response to the pandemic, even as the United States has abdicated its leading role in world affairs.\n\nMacron organized an extraordinary G7 leaders' videoconference, unusually taking the initiative even though the U.S. holds the rotating presidency of the group. And he was a driving force behind holding a first videoconference of EU leaders on the crisis on March 10.\n\nHe is finalizing a support package for Africa, which he has been building in coordination with 10 African leaders. And France is also pushing for a summit among the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council.\n\nYet these efforts have borne limited fruit so far. Despite Macron\u2019s push to cultivate good relations between the EU and China, including by sending aid to Beijing after the virus broke out, China has launched a propaganda offensive targeted at the EU, while member countries failed to highlight the help they were giving each other, even belatedly.\n\n\u201cThe EU sent 56 tons of material to China because it seemed to us that our European duty was to support a world power going through an epidemic,\u201d French Secretary of State for European Affairs Am\u00e9lie de Montchalin told POLITICO.\n\nIn that shipment on February 19, France sent China, the world\u2019s mask factory, 17 tons of medical equipment, including 560,000 surgical masks, from its limited strategic stock.\n\n\u201cThey will remember it when the time comes,\u201d Macron told his advisers at the time, according to one of them.\n\nChina requested the European aid be kept low-profile to save face, according to two European diplomatic officials. But Beijing has failed to return the favor. Instead, it has been showcasing deliveries of supplies to Italy and other European countries, even though much of the equipment has later been reported to be defective.\n\nThe Chinese embassy in France even wrote a Twitter thread ridiculing the pandemic response in democratic countries.\n\nBeijing seems to want to have it both ways. In a letter dated March 19, seen by POLITICO, in which Xi requested a call from Macron, he said France had taken \u201ca series of strong measures to counter COVID-19 that, I am convinced, will give positive results.\u201d\n\nAnd yet, Macron\u2019s camp is persisting in its push to broker international cooperation, partly out of pragmatism.\n\nFrance still depends on China for much of its mask and test needs. Until it can build up national and European production capacity and radically reduce its dependence on imports of these items, as Macron urged recently, Paris has to \"secure production chains\" and conduct \"very pragmatic cooperation,\" according to a second senior Elys\u00e9e adviser.\n\n\u201cWe need to use international cooperation for what it is and what it is right now is operational necessity,\u201d the adviser said.\n\nOn the European stage, Macron and his team have sought to play a central role, urging close cooperation across the Continent after countries shut borders, imposed export bans and took other unilateral measures as the pandemic hit.\n\n\u201cThere is a concrete European solidarity that is materializing,\" said de Montchalin. \"Where does Europe exist? It's when Luxembourg and Switzerland call and ask if I can guarantee that French nurses will keep working in their hospitals, and I say 'of course, more than 50 percent of your nurses are French, it makes no sense not to, especially in this context.' This creates new forms of solidarity and dialogue.\"\n\nBut Macron\u2019s own government has not always played the role of the exemplary European. On March 3, France requisitioned national mask production, depriving Italy, Sweden and Spain of some of their mask supply just as the epidemic was surging.\n\nMacron personally intervened on April 3 to order the release of 2 million masks bought by a Swedish company that had been held up for a month, according to an official.\n\nOn the crucial question of the European economic response to the fallout from the coronavirus, Macron\u2019s government has sought to be a bridge-builder in an increasingly fraught dispute between north and south, which has reopened deep wounds from the eurozone debt crisis of a decade ago.\n\nMacron signed a letter along with leaders of eight other countries, including Italy and Spain, urging a more collective economic response by the EU and containing a specific reference to common debt instruments, which Germany, the Netherlands and others oppose.\n\nHowever, the letter did not use the phrase \u201ccorona bonds\u201d \u2014 ruled out by northern countries. At a meeting of eurozone finance ministers earlier this week, France\u2019s Le Maire and his German counterpart, Olaf Scholz, coordinated their positions.\n\nAnd when the war is over, Macron\u2019s camp wants to win the peace, revamping the EU to increase financial solidarity, add more powers on health policy and get more money flowing directly into the bloc\u2019s budget.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have to use this crisis to give ourselves the tools to act in a stronger and quicker way in the next crisis,\u201d said MEP S\u00e9journ\u00e9.", "link": "https://www.politico.com/news/2020/04/12/macron-france-coronavirus-180100", "published": "2020-04-12T00:00:00", "author": []}, {"title": "Trump gets ratings bump amid coronavirus crisis", "text": "While Trump and some of his allies are blanching at the growing economic toll of the virus, polls show Americans aren\u2019t worried the government is going too far in trying to contain the virus.

Legislators passed the bill after voters approved Amendment 4 to the state constitution, which aimed to end the state\u2019s lifetime ban on voting for most ex-felons.\n\nHinkle\u2019s ruling did not completely strike down the law, but the judge asserted that requiring people with felony convictions to pay off costs and fees violated the U.S. Constitution\u2019s ban on poll taxes.\n\nHe said these costs, which are separate from restitution paid to victims or fines ordered by a court, amounted to a form of tax since it was used to pay for administrative costs.

They\u2019ve created misleading partisan websites pretending to be news outlets, honed their social media trolling tactics and encouraged local voters to share misinformation, including about the novel coronavirus.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a definite paradox,\u201d said Ben Nimmo, director of investigations at Graphika, a social media analytics firm that tracks these campaigns. \u201cThe U.S. far right, a nationalist and racist movement, is now trying to go global itself.\u201d\n\nThe effort\u2019s impact \u2014 to the extent that it can be measured \u2014 has not always matched its ambition.\n\nDespite a groundswell in the volume of American-made misinformation in Europe, activists\u2019 efforts largely failed to sway public opinion, according to online campaign analysts, hate-speech experts and policymakers who have tracked the growth of American digital activists operating in the EU over the last four years.\n\nBut that was hardly the point. For the most part, these groups had another audience in mind: Americans back home.\n\nIn boosting a populist European candidate, or getting a particular social media hashtag to trend ahead of an election, U.S. activists sought to piggyback on European political debates and divisions to create online propaganda to boost their world view for voters in the U.S.\n\nWhen U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson took to Twitter last fall to hail his new Brexit deal with the European Union, for instance, American Twitter users with handles such as @2BeConservative and @TRUMPISNOW started to retweet the message, according to an analysis by FirstDraftNew, a nonprofit focused on online campaigning.\n\nSoon, the hashtags #GetBrexitDone and #TakeBackControl started trending in the U.S., despite most Americans being largely apathetic toward Brexit. The idea of a polarized Britain \u2014 and a leader like Johnson who rose to the occasion to champion the will of the people \u2014 served to boost Trump\u2019s \u201cstick it to the elites\u201d narrative.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not much concern within U.S. extremist groups about what is happening in Europe,\u201d said Chloe Colliver, who heads the digital research unit at the Institute of Strategic Dialogue, a London-based think tank that analyzes online extremist speech. \u201cThey are more focused on using European elections for their own domestic-level policy and political campaigns.\u201d\n\nThe online campaign in Europe began soon after Trump was sworn into the Oval office.\n\nIn the final days of the French presidential campaign in May 2017, hackers with possible ties to the Russian government released reams of internal documents from the campaign of Emmanuel Macron, the now-French president who was up against Marine Le Pen, the leader of the far-right National Rally, in the final runoff.\n\nWithin hours, American activists, initially spurred on by Jack Posobiec, a journalist now working for the far-right news outlet One America News Network, began flooding social media with posts promoting the hacking attack with the hashtag #MacronLeaks.\n\nOn online message boards like Reddit and Discord, which are popular among far-right groups, American activists game-planned how to saturate networks in France with fake accounts. They quickly drummed up viral memes of Macron as Marie Antoinette, the out-of-touch French queen, and shared them with local activists in the hopes that Le Pen supporters would use them in their own attacks on the French president.\n\n\u201cWe must bombard French social media with pro-Le Pen propaganda to remind the French who is on their side,\u201d read a call-to-arms on 4Chan, another message board, just weeks before the election \u2014 a post that was subsequently deleted. \u201cReally hammer in the point that he doesn\u2019t give a f*ck about the common man.\u201d\n\nFor the most part, their efforts failed to get much traction among the French. Part of the reason was the language barrier, as posts were largely in English, said Tommaso Venturini, a researcher at French National Centre for Scientific Research\u2019s Centre for Internet and Society.\n\nWhen #MacronLeaks did start to trend in France, it was in large part because it was being used by people debunking claims made by far-right activists.\n\nThe incident marked \u201ca turning point\u201d for U.S. activists, according to Nimmo at Graphika.\n\nWhile the groups failed to get much attention in France, their anti-Macron hashtag was soon trending back home in the U.S. \u2014 despite most American Twitter users not interested in European politics. That allowed these activists to portray the soon-to-be French president as someone from a corrupt political elite and to link the scandal to Trump\u2019s pledges to \u201cdrain the swamp.\u201d\n\nThe incident proved they could hijack European events to their own advantage domestically, and it set the stage for efforts across the Continent.\n\nU.S. activists made their biggest impact when local far-right groups actively sought to cooperate or emulate their tactics \u2014 or when an unexpected domestic European event played into a narrative they were seeking to promote.\n\nAhead of Italy\u2019s national election in early 2018 \u2014 where populist and far-right leaders outperformed many of the country\u2019s traditional parties \u2014 local online campaigners discussed misinformation tactics with American groups in encrypted apps like Telegram and on digital message boards, according to a review of these messages by POLITICO and an analysis from the Institute for Strategic Dialogue.\n\nThe arrest of Luca Traini, a failed candidate for Italy\u2019s far-right League party who was accused of shooting and wounding six African immigrants, also offered an opening for U.S. groups. In fringe parts of the internet, they promoted him as a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre.\n\nThe Daily Stormer, a U.S. neo-Nazi media outlet, hailed Traini\u2019s actions as a boost for far-right candidates in Italy. On 4Chan, anonymous users shared viral memes depicting him as a character in popular violent video games, dubbing him a \u201cgod of racewar.\u201d\n\nWith just weeks before Italians went to the polls, an online campaign surfaced urging people to put up posters calling Traini an \u201ceroe,\u201d or hero. The call emulated a U.S. tactic \u2014 which is now becoming increasingly common across Western Europe \u2014 of sharing \u201cIt\u2019s OK to be white\u201d fliers on college campuses.\n\n\u201cIf you are Italian, please help by printing out this image and spreading wherever you can,\u201d the post read, in English, though it was unclear who was behind the message. \u201cIf you are not Italian, you can also contribute by sharing it on social networks.\u201d\n\nIn Sweden, U.S. activists also jumped on the country\u2019s national elections in late 2018 when migration became a polarizing topic amid an influx of Middle Eastern refugees.\n\nFar-right conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, as well as other U.S. pundits and outlets like Breitbart, spread false reports about the arrival of these immigrants to the Scandinavian country. Message boards were swamped with posts about the alleged degradation of Sweden\u2019s white population.\n\nSeveral alt-right leaders, including white supremacist Samuel Jared Taylor, attended extremist conferences in and around Stockholm, according to misinformation experts who tracked these campaigns.\n\nWhen Swedes eventually went to the polls, U.S. digital activists \u2014 as well as activists from other European countries like Poland \u2014 amplified incorrect claims made by local far-right groups that there had been widespread election fraud, according to a review of message board conversations by POLITICO.\n\n\u201cMASSIVE FRAUD!!\u201d one anonymous Reddit user said in a message chain that has since been deleted. \u201cWhy is the lamestream media not talking about this?\u201d\n\nThe false accusations of fraud also spread via social media bot networks, where they were then picked up by far-right media outlets in the U.S. and across Western Europe, most notably in Germany, according to analysis from the Institute for Strategic Dialogue.\n\nDespite the rapid spread of \u201cunfounded talk of electoral fraud,\u201d Mikael Tofvesson, a Swedish civil servant whose team was tasked with countering foreign interference, said he was \u201cconfident that the election wasn\u2019t interfered with.\u201d\n\nIn the U.S., the Swedish election barely made waves outside fringe groups. But right-wing activists concluded that electoral fraud could be an issue they could tap into ahead of the 2020 presidential election, according to a review of online message board conversations between these campaigners.\n\nU.S activists made inroads with topics like migration, where the far right on both sides of the Atlantic share common ground. But their lack of understanding about Europe\u2019s complex political landscape hindered many of their efforts.\n\nAhead of the European Parliament election in May, 2019, for instance, European activists grew tired, and even angry, over American groups\u2019 interest. The efforts coincided with the failed attempt by Steve Bannon, the former White House chief strategist, to unify the region\u2019s nationalist political parties under one umbrella.\n\nEuropean far-right campaigners had traded gossip, news articles and viral photos with American activists on a messaging board called QEurope \u2014 a hat-tip to QAnon, the far-right U.S. conspiracy theory alleging government efforts to undermine Trump\u2019s presidency.\n\nBut in the weeks leading up to the May vote, only a handful of participants from a small stable of fringe groups were active on the platform.\n\nOnline users grumbled that American users were posting too much material about U.S., not European, politics. \u201cNo offense, but this is a server in particular for Europeans,\u201d one anonymous moderator commented.\n\nIn Germany, U.S. activists attempted to boost attacks on the science behind climate change being made by the far-right Alternative for Germany. But their efforts, too, failed to break through.\n\nFor the most part, German voters shared a widespread belief in the scientific consensus behind climate change, according to Alexander Carius, managing director of Adelphi, a think tank in Berlin, who co-authored a review of the climate change agendas of Europe\u2019s right-wing parties. That left little, if any, room for right-wing conspiracy theories about global warming.\n\nOther times, U.S. efforts to link European politics to their world view did these groups more harm than good.\n\nIn Ireland, where U.S. activists had more success in influencing the national conversation because of the shared language, their tactics drew unwanted attention from authorities and tech companies that eventually shut some of their efforts down.\n\nIn the run-up to Ireland\u2019s referendum on abortion in May 2018, several U.S. groups started buying Facebook political ads to persuade people to vote against repealing the ban on abortion. Others sent campaigners to the streets and other cities to appeal directly to would-be supporters, claiming the Irish vote was part of a broader battle about access to abortion.\n\n\u201cPlease watch this detailed video to fully understand what is at stake in the effort to legalize Abortion by Repealing Ireland\u2019s 8th Amendment,\u201d read a Facebook ad paid for EMC Frontline Pregnancy Centers, a New York-based anti-abortion group.\n\nOver several weeks, the group\u2019s online ads \u2014 targeted at those living in Ireland \u2014 garnered hundreds of likes, shares and comments, according to the Transparent Referendum Initiative, which analyzed social media activity during the campaign. It was not possible to determine how much money these groups spent on paid-for messages due to limits to tech companies\u2019 transparency tools.\n\n\u201cThere was an international dimension to these political movements,\u201d said Liz Carolan, who co-founded the Transparent Referendum Initiative.\n\nThe volume of anti-abortion messages coming from abroad \u2014 Canadian and British right-wing activists were also active in the debate \u2014 forced both Facebook and Google to ban foreign actors from buying paid-for partisan messages a month ahead of the vote.\n\nIt was the first time that either tech giant had curtailed such political ad buying on their global platforms. After the Irish referendum \u2014 in which voters ultimately chose to legalize abortion \u2014 the ban on political ads became the companies\u2019 standard practice globally.\n\nFor all of their European excursions, American digital actors never truly took their eyes off their domestic goals.\n\nThere was no \u201cmeaningful drop-off in misinformation between 2016 and 2018,\u201d according to Laura Edelson, a computer scientist at New York University who has been tracking political messaging, particularly on Facebook, in reference to the U.S. mid-term elections.\n\nStill, the online playbook far-right groups honed during their adventures in Europe is now being targeted at the run-up to the U.S. presidential election in November, their next big trial.\n\nThe strategy includes relying on active digital campaigners on 4Chan, Discord and other online message boards to spread viral memes, doctored images and videos, some of them targeting high-profile Democratic politicians such as Nancy Pelosi and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.\n\nThe recent global health crisis has reignited such online activism, often spilling into the real world as people mobilized digitally to organize protests at U.S. state capitals against COVID-19 lockdowns. Far-right groups have sought to link the global public health crisis to long-standing bugbears \u2014 like migrants, Muslims and other minority groups.\n\nBoth U.S. and European activists have shared similar online messaging, often to attack governments and others seen as \u201celite,\u201d though both sides have pulled back from widespread coordination, according to a review of thousands of social media messages by POLITICO.\n\nHordes of Twitter users \u2014 often resembling coordinated bot networks \u2014 have also been lined up to quickly jump on the latest political hashtags to skew the discussion toward right-wing views.\n\nThere\u2019s little standing in their way.\n\nFacebook, Google and Twitter have taken steps to clamp down on the worst offenders spreading online misinformation, including limiting, or banning, organizations from buying digital political ads.\n\nBut amid the ongoing political stalemate on Capitol Hill, U.S. lawmakers have not been able to agree on new legislation to thwart the most aggressive digital tricks.\n\nMeanwhile, experts warn the online political game of cat-and-mouse \u2014 whose goal is to sway would-be voters with a barrage of partisan messaging \u2014 has already shifted elsewhere.\n\nIncreasingly, political operators \u2014 on the right and the left \u2014 are moving away from paid-for social media ads and toward so-called organic content, or regular social media posts published in private Facebook groups to reach their target audiences.\n\nTo do so, they are relying on armies of digital activists like those who cut their teeth in Europe.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re starting to see more coordinated threats published over digital platforms by these groups,\u201d said Dipayan Ghosh, a Pozen fellow at Harvard Kennedy School\u2019s Shorenstein Center and a former policy adviser at Facebook.\n\n\u201cThis election is the big target,\u201d he added, in reference to the upcoming vote in the U.S. \u201cPeople will have had four years to determine the right vectors of attack.\u201d\n\nWant more analysis from POLITICO?

Previous presidents have bristled at internal watchdogs\u2019 scrutiny but have rarely mounted such a broad-based, politically-driven campaign to chill their efforts.\n\nIn other words, a watchdog system that has operated largely on handshake agreements and tacit understandings of independence is \u2014 like many aspects of long-accepted U.S. governance \u2014 being tested like never before in the Trump era.\n\n\u201cFor the president to stand up and say, \u2018If I didn't appoint this IG, he's gone or she's gone. If I don't like what they're saying, I\u2019m going to stop them from saying it\u2019 \u2014 that does not smack of an elected democracy,\u201d said Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.) in an interview. \u201cIt smacks of a different kind of government.\u201d\n\nSen. Jon Tester. | Sarah Silbiger/Getty Images\n\nTrump has already engaged in extensive stonewalling of House investigations, which led to one of the impeachment articles against him. His Senate acquittal has left him unrestrained and eager for retribution.\n\nDemocrats\u2019 pushback reached new decibels in recent days, as Trump claimed \u201cabsolute\u201d power to remove inspectors general he dislikes, even if they\u2019re investigating cabinet officials for potential abuses.\n\n\u201cEverybody agrees that I have the absolute right to fire the inspector generals,\u201d Trump told reporters after facing questions about his decision to oust State Department IG Steve Linick, who has been reviewing an array of actions by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Trump indicated he didn\u2019t know Linick but agreed to Pompeo\u2019s request to remove him because he was appointed to the post by former President Barack Obama.\n\nOther Republicans have picked up Trump\u2019s mantle, arguing that he has unfettered power to oust inspectors general. \u201cHe has the full authority to hire and fire, under the Constitution, anybody in the executive branch,\u201d said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.\n\nTrump and McConnell\u2019s comments came amid growing calls by Democrats for new measures to restrict Trump\u2019s power to remove these IGs, some of whom have issued stinging reports about administration mismanagement and drawn the president\u2019s fury.\n\nAs part of a sprawling, $3 trillion coronavirus response package, the House recently passed a proposal authored by nearly two dozen committee chairmen that would prohibit Trump from removing inspectors general without \u201cgood cause,\u201c such as incapacitation or malfeasance. Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.) offered a similar proposal that would also provide for congressional review of IG removals and limit who the president may install as acting replacements when there\u2019s a vacancy.\n\nAnd on Friday, House Oversight Committee Chair Carolyn Maloney (D-N.Y.) offered a closely related measure that would require \u201cdocumented\u201d good cause reasons to oust an inspector general. Their efforts have been cheered by advocacy groups like the Project on Government Oversight, who say protecting IGs from political interference is a crucial aspect of modern checks and balances.\n\nIn fact, Congress has made a series of moves to protect inspectors general in the years since they were established after Watergate. The most recent push came in 2008, when Congress passed the IG Reform Act, enshrining new protections, such as a requirement that the president notify lawmakers 30 days before removing an inspector general.\n\nBut for the first time, the entire system is being challenged by a president who rejects the notion that these roving internal auditors, who straddle the bright line between Capitol Hill and the Executive Branch, should do anything but answer to him.\n\nTrump has made that clear in ways large and small. In addition to his removal of Linick at the State Department, last month Trump abruptly ousted intelligence community inspector general Michael Atkinson over his handling of a whistleblower complaint that ignited the House\u2019s impeachment effort.\n\nDays before that, Trump issued a signing statement accompanying a massive coronavirus relief law asserting that he \u2014 not Congress \u2014 decides whether an inspector general even communicates with lawmakers.\n\nIn recent weeks, Trump has also demoted or sidelined a slew of other inspectors general and moved to appoint loyalists to fill some of the vacancies. At both the State Department and Department of Transportation, the aides picked to temporarily fill the top IG position are also continuing to report to their agency bosses, a split role that Democrats and some Republicans warned could chill new whistleblowers and expose existing ones. Trump also nominated a replacement for the Health and Human Services Department IG after her office issued a report critical of the administration\u2019s pandemic response.\n\nIt\u2019s quickly become the stiffest test of the inspector general system \u2014 a pillar of the post-Watergate reform effort \u2014 since Ronald Reagan fired them all upon taking office in 1981, only to rehire some amid a withering backlash from Congress.\n\nIn fact, Congress so closely guarded the independence of inspectors general that a move by Obama to abruptly oust the AmeriCorps IG in 2009 prompted a five-month investigation by Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and then-Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) that resulted in a 62-page report sharply criticizing the decision.\n\nSen. Chuck Grassley. | Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t the first time there\u2019s been a tango or a contretemps between IGs and the president,\u201d said Saikrishna Prakash, a University of Virginia constitutional scholar. He noted that IGs are somewhat \u201canomalous\u201d and have been described as \u201cmoles for Congress\u201d because of their unique obligations to sit within the Executive Branch but report their findings to lawmakers.\n\nToday, Grassley is one of only a few Republicans raising alarms about Trump\u2019s more broad-based push to remove inspectors general he dislikes.\n\nGrassley mused just days ago that he may propose legislation to prohibit acting inspectors general who temporarily fill vacancies from continuing to report to agency leaders as well. And he\u2019s written bipartisan letters to the Trump White House demanding more detail about Trump\u2019s reasons for removing Linick and Atkinson, suggesting Trump\u2019s initial rationale \u2014 a general loss of confidence \u2014 was insufficient.\n\nStill, Grassley hasn\u2019t signaled any move toward tying Trump\u2019s hands with legislation, and such a proposal would be difficult to get passed in the GOP-controlled Senate let alone signed into law by Trump.\n\nWhether Congress can bar Trump from removing any inspector general is likely to come into focus within weeks, as the Supreme Court rules on a case over whether the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is constitutional.\n\nThe agency, which was established after the 2008 financial crisis, is being challenged by a law firm that argues its structure violates the separation of powers because its director can only be removed for specific \u201cgood cause\u201d reasons. How the court rules could determine whether other senior Executive Branch officials \u2014 such as inspectors general \u2014 can be protected from removal without violating the president\u2019s power to manage his own branch of government.\n\nThough IGs have less authority than other senior officials \u2014 they don\u2019t have the power to prosecute or control large budgets \u2014 they also have no term limits. Congress expressly opted against including a seven-year term limit in the 2008 IG reform bill; lawmakers also rejected a call to protect IGs from removal without cause in favor of a provision requiring the president to notify Congress 30 days in advance before firing an inspector general.\n\nAdding in removal protections without corresponding term limits could give the courts \u2014 now stocked with Trump-appointed judges who may be more amenable to his views on executive authority \u2014 reason to rule broadly against limiting the president\u2019s power.\n\n\u201cThere are certainly ways to make such provisions more likely to survive scrutiny (term limits would be an essential first step), but Congress needs to go in with its eyes open about the Court it\u2019s now facing,\u201d said Deborah Pearlstein, a Yeshiva University legal expert who advised the House on the constitutionality of its recent proxy voting decision.\n\nPOLITICO NEWSLETTERS POLITICO Playbook Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics.

One includes a new proposal from Tester that would automatically zero out the Department of Treasury\u2019s budget if the newly created coronavirus response inspector general is blocked from accessing internal information.\n\n\u201cCongress can stop this bullshit from happening right now if the Republicans would step up,\u201d Tester said.\n\nSome legal scholars also argue that despite the lack of certainty, previous rulings suggest Congress can impose limits on Trump\u2019s removal of inspectors general so long as they don\u2019t impede his constitutional responsibility to execute the law faithfully. A 1935 Supreme Court decision allowed Congress to limit the removal of officers who lead independent agencies like the Federal Trade Commission. The House Oversight Committee cited that ruling to support its new proposals to limit Trump\u2019s ability to fire IGs.\n\nMichael Bromwich, a former Justice Department inspector general who has since become a vocal Trump critic, said he worries that \u201cfor cause\u201d restrictions on IG removal could be unconstitutional but that proposals like Tester\u2019s could be valuable.\n\n\u201cUntil now, IGs operated in a world where they believed that standard existed as a matter of fact even though it did not exist in law,\u201d Bromwich said. That\u2019s no longer the case.\n\n", "link": "https://www.politico.com/news/2020/05/24/trump-inspectors-general-constitution-275359", "published": "2020-05-24T00:00:00", "author": ["Andrew Desiderio", "Kyle Cheney"]}, {"title": "Lavish Parties, Greedy Pols and Panic Rooms: How the \u2018Apple of Pot\u2019 Collapsed", "text": "Photo ops with politicians only went so far. State and local officials decided which companies got coveted licenses to operate and whether to treat the businesses in their backyards more like partners or adversaries. Cannabis firms needed real political clout.\n\nIn April 2018, former House Speaker John Boehner, a Republican, joined the advisory board of Acreage Holdings, another cannabis firm.\n\nFour months later, Former L.A. Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa joined MedMen\u2019s corporate board. Villaraigosa, a Democrat who has since left the board, declined to comment.\n\nAntonio Villaraigosa attends a MedMen event last November in Culver City, California. | Getty Images\n\nMedMen also hired lobbyists in Florida, Illinois, Massachusetts, California, Nevada and New York, according to state disclosure databases.\n\nEven with allies, in cannabis, everything was still harder. In one television appearance, Bierman spoke of navigating \u201cthe most arduous retail zoning restrictions known to man.\u201d\n\nIndeed, MedMen and its peers had to contend with layers of unique, untested regulations that, at times, were being enforced by people with active grudges against the industry.\n\n\u201cIn some states, the city controls it and then the county has a say and then the state, and then the feds have their say in how you make it,\u201d complained a former MedMen executive. \u201cThey\u2019re all making the rules and changing them in real time. If I could tell you one story I could tell you a million.\u201d\n\nTake windows.\n\nThe former executive pointed to Florida, where MedMen first opened locations in Key West, Sarasota and West Palm Beach.\n\nState law forbids cannabis shops from advertising, but in this new and controversial industry, the ban raised a whole slew of questions, the former executive said. \u201cWhat is advertising? Is it the sign above your door?\u201d As it turns out, no, the stores could have signs. But windows presented a problem. Passersby could look in from the streets and see MedMen branding inside. MedMen retooled its store concept to accommodate the law, removing visible branding from its interiors.\n\n\u201cThis is a challenge for anyone.\u201d\n\nBut then, the former executive recalled, regulators complained that \u201cdispensing activity\u201d taking place at the register\u2014customers paying and staff handing them red bags with weed inside\u2014remained visible from the outside. So, MedMen frosted its windows. Once the store interiors were hidden, they hung up MedMen-branded shirts for sale inside.\n\nIt turned out that frosted windows ran afoul of local police departments. So, the executive recalled, MedMen obtained permission from the state to restore its transparent windows. Regulators dropped their complaint about visible dispensing activity at the register but made MedMen take down its branded T-shirts.\n\nIt was determined that employees could still wear the shirts while working.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s Kafka,\u201d the former executive said. \u201cIt happens because the rules and regulations just don\u2019t make sense.\u201d\n\nThen, there are the complications involved in financing a cannabis business.\n\nBecause of its legal status, institutional investors have, by and large, continued to shy away from it. Despite the growing number of states that have liberalized their cannabis laws and begun regulating their own markets, it remains on Schedule 1, the federal government\u2019s list of banned narcotics. An Obama-era Justice Department policy officially discouraged prosecution of state-regulated marijuana activity, but former Attorney General Jeff Sessions rescinded that policy in 2018, raising the prospect of a renewed federal crackdown. The feared crackdown has not materialized, but Sessions\u2019 rescission underscored the precariousness of the industry\u2019s position.\n\nMost banks will not even allow pot firms to open accounts out of fear of federal money-laundering laws. Those that offer their services do so quietly. Though MedMen has found banks to work with, a company spokesman told Yahoo News in 2018 that none of them wanted to be identified in the press.\n\nIt does not help, either, that cannabis firms face higher federal tax rates than others thanks to a provision of the tax code designed to prevent drug dealers from taking business deductions.\n\nLas Vegas-based cannabis investor Leslie Bocskor said such restrictions often push cannabis operators to seek less savory sources of financing than they otherwise would need to. \u201cWe\u2019ve created a gray market for money,\u201d he said, \u201cin the same way that we had a gray market for cannabis.\u201d\n\nJust providing customers a normal payment experience can be an ordeal. Rolling Stone reported that, for a time before MedMen went public, its stores accepted credit cards. It cloaked the practice from the card companies, which do not want to serve pot businesses, by registering under the name of an obscure corporate subsidiary. Now, the company no longer accepts credit, advertising that it takes debit cards and cash instead.\n\nBecause of federal securities law, those companies that manage to shimmy through this obstacle course and grow large enough to seek financing in the public markets have to go abroad to do so. Bocskor lays some of the blame for MedMen\u2019s troubles at the feet of its unusual foreign IPO. Being forced to go public in Canada, rather than on an American exchange, he argues, hobbles companies by forcing them to navigate an unfamiliar regulatory landscape. He said it also makes the stock less accessible to U.S. investors, who can be uncomfortable with foreign markets.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not specific to MedMen,\u201d Bocskor said. \u201cThis is a challenge for anyone.\u201d\n\nChapter 6 Bad Comedown\n\nMedMen\u2019s headquarters sits in an industrial space on an unglamorous drag in Culver City, a section of L.A. inland from Venice Beach. Across the street are manufacturers of military-grade electronic components and protective equipment for industrial workers.\n\nOne cannabis executive who visited the headquarters in its prime was struck by the super high-end sports cars in the first two parking spots outside the entrance\u2014out of place in both the neighborhood and in this still-modest industry.\n\nOther hints of MedMen\u2019s grand designs only became apparent inside, where the decor, all red metal and glass, betrayed Bierman\u2019s ambitions to mimic tech startups.\n\nIn the go-go days of 2018, the office featured free snacks and other Silicon Valley-style perks. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t over the top,\u201d one former employee said. \u201cOther than the kombucha machine. I found that a little strange.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey would ask themselves at times, \u2018Are we a marijauana company or a tech company?\u2019\u201d\n\nAs MedMen raised ever more money, the headquarters grew more crowded, another departure from leanly staffed peers.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t believe it,\u201d said another cannabis executive who visited the bustling headquarters. \u201cWhat do all these people do?\u201d\n\nTwo former executives said the firm maintained a small \u201cculture group,\u201d whose job it was to guide the company culture.\n\nMedMen also regularly had a masseur visit the premises to pamper staffers, though one former employee said a peek at the man\u2019s schedule revealed he sometimes would only have one session of 30 or 45 minutes booked per day.\n\nThere was a therapist on staff, called a \u201cperformance improvement expert\u201d\u2014who happened to be Bierman\u2019s personal marriage counselor\u2014at a salary of more than $300,000 a year, according to allegations later made in court and denied by MedMen.\n\nThe firm had also invested heavily in IT, building its own in-house point-of-sale system, MyMedMen.\n\n\u201cThey would ask themselves at times, \u2018Are we a marijauana company or a tech company?\u2019\u201d recalled the person, who viewed the expenditures as wasteful distractions from the firm\u2019s core business, pointing to the founders\u2019 lack of experience in the tech industry. \u201cIt was nuts. It was literally nuts.\u201d\n\nThe market suspended its disbelief. In October of 2018, MedMen announced a deal to purchase PharmaCann, an Illinois-based retailer with operations in several states, for nearly $700 million in stock. It was to be the largest-ever cannabis acquisition in the U.S., and the move played well with investors.\n\nBut by the end of the year, the spending and the bravado began to catch up with Bierman. In the second half 2018 alone, MedMen lost more than $130 million according to its disclosures.\n\nIn November, two MedMen subsidiaries were hit with a class-action lawsuit in a Los Angeles court alleging labor law violations. At the time, a MedMen spokesman told Marijuana Business Daily, \u201cWe offer competitive compensation and strive to cultivate a thriving work environment.\u201d The case remains ongoing.\n\nIn December, the city of West Hollywood announced that MedMen\u2019s flagship, which had been operating on a temporary permit, would not receive a permanent license to sell marijuana, placing the store in a state of semi-permanent legal limbo.\n\nIn the first week of 2019, two early investors in MedMen sued Bierman, Modlin and the company. The plaintiffs claimed that the defendants were improperly preventing them from cashing in their shares. They also accused the founders of abusing the business\u2019s complex corporate structure to engage in \u201crampant, brazen self-dealing.\u201d\n\nA company spokesman described the allegations as \u201cfrivolous claims\u201d and said that the plaintiffs had already profited on their investments.\n\nLater that month, the company\u2019s outgoing CFO filed a more sensational suit. In his complaint, James Parker claimed that Bierman and Modlin breached his contract by forcing him out of the company in response to his attempts to professionalize its finances and uphold his fiduciary duties to shareholders.\n\nParker also alleged in his complaint that Bierman, in private, called Los Angeles City Councilman Herb Wesson a \u201cmidget negro\u201d (a spokesman for Wesson declined to comment) and called a marijuana activist a \u201cfat, black lesbian\u201d; that the founders threw around terms like \u201ccunt,\u201d \u201cretard\u201d and \u201cpussy-bitch\u201d and were intoxicated at corporate events; that Bierman told him to go up to an employee\u2019s hotel room and tell the employee to \u201ctake his fist out of his boyfriend\u2019s ass, and tell him to get to work.\u201d\n\nParker\u2019s vivid portrait of the workplace environment was only the beginning.\n\nThe complaint alleged that he was ordered to pay a Canadian firm hundreds of thousands of dollars so it would buy MedMen stock, to prop up its price when it was \u201cunder attack,\u201d and to pay private intelligence firms to dig up dirt on MedMen\u2019s perceived enemies.\n\nHis complaint alleged that the founders were not fully transparent about non-arm\u2019s-length transactions with related entities and that they ordered the opening of a \u201csham office\u201d in Vancouver to fool Canadian regulators.\n\nThe complaint alleged that Bierman spoke of falsifying his personal brokerage statement, with Modlin\u2019s help, to apply for a home mortgage. Parker also alleged that Bierman asked him to donate to a Nevada politician because Bierman had personally maxed out and promised the politician more contributions. And the complaint alleged that company funds were used to pay for personal furniture for Modlin to indirectly reimburse a contribution Modlin made to the same Nevada politician.\n\nCampaign-finance records show that the only Nevada candidate to receive maximum contributions from Parker, Bierman and Modlin is Sisolak, who presided over \u201cMedMen Day\u201d weeks before his election as Nevada\u2019s governor.

Gardner \u2014 a conservative Republican \u2014 earned its loyalty when he vowed to block judicial nominees in the Senate until he received a promise from President Donald Trump that the Justice Department would stay out of Colorado\u2019s cannabis industry. Then-governor and moderate Democrat Hickenlooper vetoed three cannabis bills, angering much of the industry and leaving a permanent bad taste in their mouths for the politician.\n\nHickenlooper's campaign said as governor, he helped Colorado become a model for marijuana legalization, and he would be a friend to the industry going forward.\n\n\"As senator, John will fight for federal decriminalization, to declassify cannabis from Schedule I, and actually pass banking reform \u2014 something Sen. Gardner has failed to get through Mitch McConnell's Senate,\" Deputy Communications Director Alyssa Roberts said. Removing cannabis from Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act would lift the federal ban on marijuana.\n\nDemocratic and Republican strategists say the industry is formidable when mobilized.

Pace, the former Colorado House leader who helped with Polis\u2019 2018 effort, said cannabis industry worker turnout increased from 29 percent in 2014 to over 50 percent in 2018 \u2014 approximately 15,000 voters. Pace also worked with dispensaries to reach the more than 1 million cannabis consumers in the state.\n\nWhile some industry leaders, Pace, and lobbyists, including Melissa Kuipers Blake of Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck \u2014 who represents the Cannabis Trade Federation \u2014 say Gardner retains more support from the cannabis industry, the Democratic narrative of him being all talk and no action could influence undecided voters. When Gardner threatened to hold up the Senate\u2019s Memorial Day recess this week, Hickenlooper accused him of giving up too easily and not standing his ground to get more from McConnell. Gardner received just one concession from McConnell, and it was to create funding for maintenance projects on federal lands, not cannabis banking. Colorado Democrats also note Hickenlooper could help flip the Senate blue \u2014 creating a much clearer path for cannabis legislation.\n\n\"At the end of the day,\" said Andrew Short, a Democratic strategist in Colorado, \"the industry needs to see results.\"\n\nGardner\u2019s cannabis moment may have already passed, however. Current polling \u2014 which shows Hickenlooper up 54 to 36 percentage points in Colorado \u2014 may be the writing on the wall for Republican leaders. If McConnell thinks Gardner can't be saved, advocates and staffers say, he may be less inclined to pass Gardner's legislation.\n\n\u201cIt's always helpful to have someone who's vulnerable championing your issue,\" a Democrat House staffer working closely on cannabis legislation said in April. \"If Mitch McConnell thought that he was super in play and could save Cory Gardner, things might be a little different.

South Korea, meanwhile, tracked down and tested 65,000 people following an outbreak in a Seoul nightclub district earlier this month. The 170 people who tested positive are in quarantine.\n\nCordero said areas where outbreaks occur should close down businesses and reinstitute orders to stay home. Robust testing and tracing is also essential, he said.\n\nState officials in Alabama, however, appear to be ignoring that advice. Scott Harris, the state health officer, argued that even if Montgomery hospitals\u2019 conventional ICU beds are full, hospitals have other spaces they can use.\n\n\u201cThey have the ability within their four walls to handle that,\u201d he said Thursday.\n\nMarie French, Sam Sutton and Ryan Heath contributed to this report.", "link": "https://www.politico.com/news/2020/05/24/coronavirus-second-wave-stay-at-home-orders-273984", "published": "2020-05-24T00:00:00", "author": []}, {"title": "The political neophyte Democrats are betting on to capture the Senate", "text": "Iowa looms as a potential blockbuster on the Senate map \u2014 a contest Democrats need to put firmly in play as part of their takeover strategy. It\u2019s not yet a top-tier race on the level of Arizona or North Carolina, but Democrats say they can win despite Iowa's lurch to the right in recent years, including Ernst's 2014 victory and Donald Trump's decisive win in 2016.\n\nAll of this is playing out as in-person campaigning has been all but eliminated, and as candidates are scrambling to execute get-out-the-vote plans in the first major Senate contest happening during the pandemic.\n\n\u201cWe are in an election cycle like we've never seen before,\u201d said Charlie Wishman, the president of the Iowa AFL-CIO, which endorsed Greenfield and is hitting phone banks to encourage members to vote for her by mail. \u201cWhile it looks like Theresa Greenfield is in a really good spot to win this primary, I don't think anybody should take anything for granted whatsoever.\u201d\n\nThe party has gone all in on Greenfield \u2014 who failed to make the ballot in 2018, her only previous run for office, because her congressional campaign manager forged signatures without her knowledge.\n\nShe entered the race as a virtual unknown, on equal footing with the other Democratic candidates: Nearly three in four Iowans, 73 percent, told a Des Moines Register poll in March they didn't have an opinion of her. But the same poll also showed significant slippage in Ernst's approval rating, a potential sign of vulnerability for a senator once viewed as a solid bet for reelection.\n\nRepublicans have taken notice: The National Republican Senatorial Committee, the Senate GOP\u2019s official campaign arm, is prepared to strike, launching its first ads the week after the primary. It\u2019s part of a planned air barrage with more than $15 million already on the books from GOP outside groups, their second-largest general election investment of any race so far.\n\nGreenfield still needs to survive her first test: the primary. Limited public polling has shown her with an edge, and she has significantly outraised all of her opponents and boasts more on-the-ground support from unions and Iowa Democrats. Her campaign and outside groups supporting her combine for a more than 20-to-1 TV spending advantage over Democrats Michael Franken and self-funder Eddie Mauro, whose most recent ads have been attacks aimed at the frontrunner.\n\nBut despite an already overwhelming disparity, more help is on the way. EMILY\u2019s List, which backed Greenfield immediately after she entered the race, is going negative against Franken, a former three-star Navy admiral who grew up in Iowa and moved back to run for the office. A super PAC affiliated with the group is set to spend nearly $1 million in ads attacking Franken\u2019s recent return to Iowa and labeling the former Navy admiral a \u201cWashington, D.C. defense contractor.\u201d\n\nDemocrats aren't just trying to propel Greenfield to victory in the primary \u2014 they want her riding a wave of momentum headed into the general election. Mairead Lynn, a spokesperson for EMILY\u2019s List, said in a statement Greenfield's opponents were \u201cbaselessly\u201d attacking her, but her supporters remain confident she will defeat Ernst and \u201cfinally give Iowa voters what they deserve \u2014 a senator who fights for them.\"\n\nGreenfield\u2019s message has been focused on her upbringing on a farm and her first husband\u2019s death on the job as an electrician, which occurred when she was a young mother, forcing her to rely on Social Security and union benefits.\n\nShe has also leaned on her local political operation, announcing endorsements from nearly three dozen additional Iowa Democrats Friday. Her latest TV ad highlighted backing from unions, members of the state\u2019s congressional delegation and Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Pete Buttigieg and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), three of the top five finishers in this year's Iowa caucuses.\n\n\u201cThat's how you win. You build a strong grassroots team right here in Iowa,\u201d Greenfield said in a televised primary debate last week, touting her in-state fundraising. \u201cI'm proud of that, and I'm going to continue to work hard, because that's what you need to do to win back this seat and defeat Sen. Ernst this fall.\u201d\n\nGreenfield's faced some friendly fire: Mauro, a businessman who has lost in previous runs for office, has trained his TV ads against her \u2014 something most Democrats believe is unlikely to boost his campaign but could damage Greenfield's image. Franken has touted his endorsement by the Des Moines Register, and his campaign pushed back aggressively on the attack from EMILY\u2019s List.\n\nKimberley Boggus, Franken\u2019s campaign manager, called the attack \"shameful discrimination against those who have served their country\" and Franken called for Greenfield to denounce it in a video posted by his campaign.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to become clear to voters in the next few days the outside influence of money in this race,\" Boggus said in a statement. \"Iowans need to decide what they want in Washington, more of the same or what they need? That is someone to take on Mitch McConnell and, at times, Chuck Schumer as well.\u201d\n\nAll of the Senate Majority PAC advertising has been positive spots highlighting Greenfield\u2019s biography, aimed at boosting her image. It's the second time this year the group has intervened in a primary. Ahead of the March primary in North Carolina, Senate Majority PAC sent nearly $13 million to two different outside groups to help boost DSCC-backed Cal Cunningham against an insurgent challenger, although some of that spending came after a Republican group meddled in the Democratic race.\n\nDemocrats are hoping to get a twofold benefit out of the spending: propel Greenfield in the primary and also increase her name ID among Iowa voters, most of whom don\u2019t know her, before Republicans are on the airwaves attacking. The NRSC has reserved $2.6 million on TV starting one week after the primary and running through mid-July to attack the Democratic nominee. Senate Leadership Fund, a GOP super PAC, has more than $12 million booked for the fall.\n\n\u201cThe more Democrats can do early on to define who our nominee is, the better that will serve them in the fall,\u201d said Sam Roecker, who managed Democrat Patty Judge\u2019s unsuccessful 2016 Senate campaign.\n\nMorning Score Your guide to the permanent campaign \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox.

State GOP chair Jeff Kaufmann said after the primary debates last week he thought the contrast between Greenfield and Ernst, a first-term senator and military veteran, would be a major edge for Republicans.\n\n\"Theresa Greenfield's weaknesses as a candidate have been laid bare by members of her own party, and Chuck Schumer's special interest money can't fix this disaster,\" said Jesse Hunt, a spokesperson for the NRSC.\n\nThe relatively sleepy primary turned divisive last week during three separate debates. Mauro, Franken and Kimberly Graham, another candidate, attacked Greenfield for her fundraising and the outside intervention on her behalf. Greenfield said she doesn\u2019t control the outside groups and had \u201cnothing to say\u201d about the intervention. But she also returned fire, arguing the other candidates hadn\u2019t built grassroots support to match hers.\n\n\u201cIf those people had the DSCC endorsement, they would gladly accept that help and everything that comes with it, too,\u201d said Wishman, the AFL-CIO president.\n\nStill, some Democrats beyond the candidates themselves remain irked by the intervention. Most don\u2019t fault Greenfield or dismiss her chances in the fall, according to conversations with several Iowa Democrats, but are frustrated the outcome seemed predetermined.\n\nOne Iowa Democratic elected official, who is neutral in the race and spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the intraparty matter, said Greenfield\u2019s biggest differentiator is the resources behind her.\n\n\u201cIf nothing else, it would have been great to see them compete on an even field,\u201d the official said.", "link": "https://www.politico.com/news/2020/05/24/democrats-iowa-senate-ernst-greenfield-275141", "published": "2020-05-24T00:00:00", "author": []}, {"title": "Britain\u2019s Boris Johnson gambles on public forgiveness for top aide", "text": "But Johnson, speaking at the government's daily coronavirus press conference on Sunday evening, stood four-square behind Cummings \u2014 the strategic guru who masterminded the Brexit campaign and Johnson\u2019s path to a thumping election victory.\n\nThe prime minister said he fully accepted the adviser's explanation that he had \"no alternative\" but to travel to guarantee childcare for his four-year-old son should he and his wife become too ill.\n\n\"I think he followed the instincts of every father and every parent,\" Johnson said.\n\nThe U.K.'s guidance is that those who develop symptoms, as Cummings' wife did, \"must stay at home for at least seven days.\" Other members of the household must stay put for 14 days.\n\nBut Johnson said the advice was also \"absolutely clear that if you have childcare issues, that is a factor that has to be taken into account.\" The official guidance advises parents who develop symptoms to \"keep following\" general advice \"the best of your ability,\" but acknowledges \"not all these measures will be possible.\" In short, discretion is limited.\n\nCitizens who have made severe sacrifices and compromises in their own daily lives, though \u2014 including not being able to say goodbye in person to dying relatives \u2014 may feel that traveling hundreds of miles to stay near family stretches the parental allowances.\n\nIn truth, the precise interpretation of the rules now matters less than public perception \u2014 and initial polling looks bad for Cummings. According to a YouGov snap poll published Saturday evening, 68 percent of respondents said they thought Cummings had broken the lockdown rules, and several MPs reported having inboxes full of complaints from the public \u2014 many of whom have experienced similar situations to Cummings, but stayed put despite the difficulties.\n\nIts a fault-line for Johnson's government that the opposition Labour Party, under new leader Keir Starmer, is determined to exploit. \"This was a test of the prime minister and he has failed it,\" Starmer said. \"It is an insult to sacrifices made by the British people that Boris Johnson has chosen to take no action against Dominic Cummings.\"\n\nDowning Street and senior ministers had rallied to Cummings\u2019 defense on Saturday and the adviser himself insists that he acted \u201creasonably and legally\u201d because he was acting in the interests of his four-year-old son.\n\nBut former Tory Immigration Minister Caroline Nokes tweeted on Sunday there could not be \u201cwriggle room\u201d for some people when it comes to lockdown restrictions, and that she had made her views clear to her whip.\n\nTwo days after the Guardian and Mirror first reported the story, it was still dominating front pages and the morning political shows on Sunday. These included new claims that Cummings had been spotted 30 miles from his parents\u2019 house on Easter day and in Durham on April 19, allegedly on a separate trip up from London.\n\nThe latter was branded untrue by Cabinet minister Grant Shapps earlier on Sunday. When asked about the former, Johnson said he was \"content that in all periods ... he behaved responsibly and correctly,\" although the prime minister pointedly avoided a specific denial.\n\nBut it is the first allegation that has lodged in the public memory \u2014 and Tory backbenchers are highly attuned to constituent anger over any suggestion that there is one rule for those in power and another for everyone else. In backing Cummings to the hilt, Johnson is risking a confrontation with his own MPs, many of whom have never been all that fond of Cummings' radical, iconoclastic instincts.\n\n\u201cCummings must go before he does any more harm,\u201d prominent Brexiteer MP Steve Baker told Sky News\u2019 Sophy Ridge on Sunday. \u201cIf he doesn\u2019t resign, we\u2019ll just keep burning through Boris\u2019 political capital at a rate we can ill afford in the midst of this crisis.\u201d\n\nOther Conservative MPs have publicly joined Baker\u2019s call, including Simon Hoare, Roger Gale, Craig Whittaker, Peter Bone and Damian Collins, with the latter saying Cummings has a \u201ctrack record of believing that the rules don\u2019t apply to him and treating the scrutiny that should come to anyone in a position of authority with contempt.\u201d\n\nThe YouGov poll also found that 52 percent said they thought Cummings should resign. Meanwhile, an online petition calling for Cummings to be sacked had collected more than 140,000 signatures by Sunday evening.\n\nCummings is widely acknowledged, even by his critics, as a brilliant reader of public opinion. Under him, Johnson's Downing Street has been assiduously monitoring and responding to what the public thinks.\n\nNow, the question that decides how this saga ends could well be \u2014 what do they think of Cummings?", "link": "https://www.politico.com/news/2020/05/24/boris-johnson-gambles-on-public-forgiveness-for-top-aide-277272", "published": "2020-05-24T00:00:00", "author": []}, {"title": "Rick Scott says the Bill of Rights trumps all", "text": "His comments citing the First Amendment came on the first Sunday after Trump labeled the country's places of worship \"essential\" and demanded that they be allowed to reopen nationwide despite still-rising coronavirus cases and several reports of the illness spreading among congregants.\n\nAsked whether he would feel comfortable attending church on Sunday, the former Florida governor responded: \"It doesn't matter what a governor says or president or local leaders.

Can he do that?", "text": "Some dismissed Trump\u2019s rhetoric as election-year bluster not tethered to reality.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump\u2019s statement on its face sounds more like political grandstanding than any actual enforcement of laws protecting religious freedom,\u201d said Anthony Romero of the American Civil Liberties Union. \u201cThe states are accorded great deference and, in fact, the governors are the ones who are in the saddle on most of these judgment calls, notwithstanding the president\u2019s thoughts and desires.\u201d\n\nAs is often the case, Trump was long on bravado and short on explanation for how he planned to force his views on state leaders who declined to go along.\n\n\u201cAllow these very important, essential places of faith to open right now for this weekend. If they don\u2019t do it, I will override the governors,\u201d he insisted, before departing as reporters clamored for answers about the purported federal mandate.\n\nEven his Harvard Law-trained press secretary, Kayleigh McEnany, struggled to explain about how the president would implement such an order, dismissing questions about the idea as \u201chypothetical\u201d and lashing out at reporters for their supposed lack of faith.\n\nDespite the lack of detail, the president\u2019s blunt rhetoric put a new spotlight on the federal government\u2019s most prominent effort to try to police state and local stay-at-home orders: a drive announced last month by Attorney General William Barr to pursue those regulations for potential violations of religious liberty, as well as other infringements on the rights of Americans.\n\nSo far, Trump\u2019s promise to come to the rescue of beleaguered congregations has translated into only modest action. The Justice Department has yet to file a lawsuit on behalf of any church, organization or individual over the impact of state or local lockdown orders. Before Friday, its only court action was submitting what amounted to friend-of-the-court briefs in just two pandemic-related suits involving churches: one against a small Mississippi city and another against Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam.\n\nThe claims the federal government has made in the litigation have also been modest. Justice Department lawyers did not advance any argument on par with Trump\u2019s broad assertion Friday that houses of worship are universally essential. Instead, DOJ attorneys have made the narrower argument that some churches are being subject to an unfair double-standard, especially when compared to businesses deemed essential and allowed to remain open, like liquor stores.\n\nA top federal prosecutor said Friday that tallying up the number of Justice Department court filings doesn\u2019t take account of how DOJ lawyers have prompted revision of some onerous local policies simply by reaching out to mayors and local officials.\n\n\"Although the existence of a pandemic might be considered extraordinary, it does not call for federal intervention in state proceedings.\" Obama-appointed Judge Arenda Allen\n\n\u201cThere may have been few lawsuits filed, but there have been a lot of back-channel, government-to-government calls made,\u201d Zachary Terwilliger, the U.S. Attorney based in Alexandria, Va., told POLITICO. \u201cFolks have decided to stand down once they realize we\u2019re serious and this is not just rhetoric.\u201d\n\nTerwillinger welcomed Trump\u2019s statements Friday and said the idea that churches are essential has a compelling, common-sense logic to it.\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019re in a situation where we\u2019ve got Wal-Mart open with social distancing, why not church? This is essential for some people\u2026. This is as essential as a liquor store, as essential as a tattoo parlor,\u201d the prosecutor and former senior Justice Department official said.\n\nCritics said Trump\u2019s comments may not have been tied to any federal action, but rather to encourage churchgoers and ministers to defy state officials, precipitating on-the-ground conflicts and bad publicity that governors would likely avoid by softening their virus-related activity bans.\n\nTrump\u2019s statements \u201cmislead people and embolden people to defy important public safety orders and put everyone at risk,\u201d Laser said.\n\nTrump\u2019s drive to re-open churches comes despite a growing body of evidence tying church services to serious outbreaks of coronavirus. Just Tuesday, the Centers for Disease Control released a warning about Arkansas church meetings in March where more than a third of 92 attendees wound up infected. Another 26 members of the community wound up hit by the virus. Four people died.\n\nSimilar church-focused outbreaks have been reported in Washington state, South Korea and France. Experts theorize that hand-holding, singing and the fellowship typical of church services create robust vectors to transmit the virus, particularly through airborne droplets.\n\nLaser said those episodes undercut the notion that going to church is just like going to the liquor store or Home Depot. \u201cIf you start to think about the activity, it\u2019s very different than going to purchase whiskey,\u201d she said. \u201cLiquor stores don\u2019t exist as community places of gathering where there are going to be exchanges of germs\u2026The distinction is based in public safety.\u201d\n\nSeveral institutional and legal hurdles have limited the Justice Department effort.\n\nOne is that Trump and other federal officials have declared states of emergency over the pandemic that remain in effect. The Justice Department itself has relied on the threat posed by the outbreak to justify a series of extraordinary measures taken by the Trump administration, like shutting down processing of many asylum claims.", "link": "https://www.politico.com/news/2020/05/23/can-trump-order-states-to-open-churches-275170", "published": "2020-05-23T00:00:00", "author": ["Obama-Appointed Judge Arenda Allen"]}, {"title": "Behind Trump\u2019s demand to reopen churches: Slipping poll numbers and alarm inside his campaign", "text": "On Thursday, Trump also floated a potential move by his administration to reopen houses of worship in the near future.\n\n\u201cThe churches are not being treated with respect by a lot of Democratic governors,\u201d Trump said as he left the White House to visit a ventilator factory in Michigan. \u201cI want to get our churches open. We will take a very strong position on that very soon.\u201d\n\nSome Trump allies have attributed the recent slump in the president\u2019s support to the closure of churches that Trump addressed on Friday. Social-distancing guidelines forced most churches to suspend in-person worship or move Sunday services into the virtual sphere, and one member of the Trump campaign\u2019s \u201cEvangelicals for Trump\u201d coalition suggested that faith leaders and parishioners who have been frustrated by the limitations are mistakenly blaming Trump. (Religious institutions in Kentucky, Texas, Virginia, Tennessee, Louisiana and California have all brought legal challenges against their states for restrictions on religious activities and gatherings.)\n\n\u201cThose who don\u2019t understand the legalities of the process could be blaming the president or the administration when the federal government is dealing with states\u2019 rights issues,\u201d said Mark Burns, a South Carolina pastor and prominent Trump supporter.\n\nIt was not immediately clear whether the president's order on Friday \u2014 that state and local officials must take immediate action to reopen religious institutions \u2014 was legally permissible, nor was it clear how administration officials planned to enforce the guidance.\n\nGuidelines released this week by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention about reopening certain establishments \u2014 including schools, public transit systems and child care facilities \u2014 did not mention how religious institutions should go about returning to in-person worship services and ministry opportunities. One senior administration official said the guidance was omitted due to concerns that the prescriptions CDC staffers planned to provide were too restrictive.\n\nIt\u2019s unlikely that critics of church closings alone are responsible for the decline in Trump\u2019s favorability among critical religious demographics. According to the Pew survey, 43 percent of white evangelicals and 52 percent of white Catholics think the current restrictions on public activity in their areas are appropriate versus 42 percent and 31 percent, respectively, who think fewer restrictions would be better. Greater shares of white evangelicals and white Catholics also said they are more afraid about their state governments lifting restrictions on public activity too soon than they are about leaving the restrictions in place for too long.\n\nAs the coronavirus-related death toll approaches 100,000 and outbreaks emerge in locations where social distancing is more difficult, Laura Gifford, a historian of politics and religion at George Fox University, said it\u2019s likely become harder for the president\u2019s supporters to embrace his plans for an accelerated reopening of the country. The more Trump contradicts health officials who have warned against reopening schools and nonessential businesses, she suggested, the less accepting his usual supporters might become of his overall response.\n\n\u201cIf grandma\u2019s retirement home is suffering from an outbreak, there\u2019s pretty good evidence that something is awry and it makes it difficult to ignore what public health experts are saying,\u201d Gifford said. \u201cThis is something where that is harder to ignore than previous controversies or crises because it has life-and-death consequences for congregations and religious populations.\u201d\n\nPart of the strategy Trump allies have adopted to protect his relationship with conservative Christians is to frame the novel coronavirus \u2014 and church closures in response to social distancing restrictions \u2014 as a threat to religious freedom. The president\u2019s religious supporters routinely cite religious liberty as one of their top priorities and an area in which they believe the Trump administration has been exceptionally receptive.", "link": "https://www.politico.com/news/2020/05/22/trump-churches-evaneglicals-coronavirus-274842", "published": "2020-05-22T00:00:00", "author": []}, {"title": "Trump\u2019s sales pitch: I\u2019ve got a list for you", "text": "But it's also a way the businessman-turned-politician tries to sell his administration\u2019s work on any issue, touting big numbers or a large group of participants as proof of success. And Trump frequently frames the list \u2014 and its contents \u2014 in a selective manner, crafting the narrative he wants. Context is less important.\n\nAs the president has tried to convince the public of his success in responding to the coronavirus outbreak, Trump has similarly leaned on lists to try and defend his actions on testing, illustrate the support he has to reopen the economy, and even display his dismay over governors and states he feels have gone too far with stay-at-home restrictions.\n\nJust this past week, Trump reveled in a mental list he has been keeping of how many tests the U.S. has conducted, approaching 14 million, in comparison with other countries \u2014 Germany at 3 million, Italy at 3 million. That list, like so many others, is designed to ensure American is ranked No. 1. When a reporter asked Trump how America\u2019s testing compared with those of other countries on a per capita basis, a measure by which the U.S. lags behind several countries, Trump deflected the issue.\n\n\u201cYou know, when you say \u2018per capita,\u2019 there\u2019s many per capitas,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s like, per capita relative to what? But you can look at just about any category, and we\u2019re really at the top, meaning positive on a per capita basis, too.\u201d\n\nStephen Farnsworth, a professor of political science at the University of Mary Washington and the author of \u201cPresidential Communication and Character,\u201d called Trump's strategy \"the political version of a real estate agent trying to say, look at the size of the bedrooms, look at the size of the yard or the school district. The longer the list is, the more likely someone can find something or someone on that list to like.\"\n\nThe president outlined his use of bravado in his book \u201cThe Art of the Deal,\u201d writing: \u201cPeople may not always think big themselves, but they still get excited by those who do. That\u2019s why a little hyperbole never hurts. People want to believe that something is the biggest and the greatest and the most spectacular.\u201d\n\nAnthony Scaramucci, Trump\u2019s former communications director, said the tic is emblematic of the president's unique way of communicating.\n\n\u201cSomebody that\u2019s a more established politician will have a PowerPoint or a teleprompter and they\u2019ll try to say the words in perfect paragraphs and it\u2019ll be, by and large, not that inflammatory \u2014 and he does the opposite,\u201d Scaramucci said. \u201cThat freewheeling nature \u2014 there\u2019s a lot of mistruths, a lot of shots fired that bounce around in the box \u2014 people take it for granted that he\u2019s going to do that. If you\u2019re an established politician, you need to be more contrived.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s also simply a way for the president to cast blame.\n\nIn his first news conference after the 2018 midterm election, when Republicans lost control of the House, Trump\u2019s response to the setback was to tick through a list of Republican lawmakers who didn\u2019t embrace him and lost.\n\nMonths later, when Trump held an impeachment acquittal ceremony at the White House, the president was ready with insults for a list of political foes, like former FBI Director James Comey, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff.\n\nOther times, it\u2019s a tactic deployed simply to filibuster or flatter.\n\nAt the impeachment acquittal celebration, Trump also ticked off a list of \u201ca great group of warriors\u201d that included over a dozen Republican allies.\n\n\u201cJim Banks of Indiana. Jim. Andy Biggs, where is Andy?\u201d Trump called out. \u201dBradley Burn, Alabama. What a great place. \u2026 Devin Nunes. Unbelievable. \u2026 Lee Zeldin, how good are you?

They also said the fact that they legally can\u2019t start counting those ballots until the morning of Election Day is complicating matters. In addition to delaying a final tally, the chaos and confusion could sow distrust ahead of the general election and give fodder to those seeking to discredit its results.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had a lot of people reach out to me so far. They got the wrong party ballot sent to them. They got the wrong district ballot sent to them. And now I\u2019m having people getting multiple ballots sent to them. These are the things that are inevitable when you rush the implementation of mail-in voting like we did here,\u201d said Allegheny County Democratic Councilwoman and election board member Bethany Hallam. \u201cBut I\u2019m worried that, if Donald Trump loses in November, do the Republicans use all these examples of errors with mail-in voting as their excuse to invalidate election results?\u201d\n\nDemocratic Gov. Tom Wolf signed no-excuse mail-in ballot voting and other reforms into law late last year, making the June 2 primary the first test of those changes. Prior to the coronavirus outbreak, election officials expected to have months, if not years, to acclimate voters to the option of voting by mail. Instead, they\u2019ve been forced to transform the system overnight.\n\nIn Philadelphia, whose metro area is the most populous part of the state, officials predicted before the pandemic that they would get 70,000 to 90,000 applications for mail-in and absentee ballots in the primary. Through Thursday, with several days to go until the deadline, they had already received about 158,000. They said the previous record, set in a presidential general election, was roughly 23,000.\n\nThe deluge has led to a backlog: Officials said last week about 18,000 ballots are still waiting to be sent to city voters.\n\nIn Pittsburgh\u2019s Allegheny County, the second biggest county in the state, the situation is worse: It had a backlog of 80,000 ballots last week. It has received more than 225,000 mail-in and absentee ballot applications through Thursday \u2014 compared with the 10,000 absentee ballots it gets in a typical presidential primary, officials said,\n\n\u201cWe don't just have a perfect storm. We have perfect storms,\u201d said Republican Al Schmidt, one of the three Philadelphia city commissioners who oversee elections here. \u201cWe have new voting technology. We have an election reform that pushed back all the deadlines. And we have mail-in ballots and the pandemic.\u201d\n\nThough election officials said they will process all of the mailed-in votes and that most of the errors with the ballots have been minor, they worry that news reports like thousands of ballots with flawed instructions being sent to voters in suburban Philadelphia\u2019s Montgomery County will lead to increased suspicion of the new voting method.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear which party will be harmed more by such doubts. In low-income and minority neighborhoods in Democratic-dominated Philadelphia, voters have requested mail-in ballots at lower rates than those in more affluent areas. Overall, though, 69 percent of applications processed for mail and absentee ballots in the state have come from Democratic voters, compared with 30 percent from Republicans, which some GOP insiders in the state blame on Trump\u2019s opposition to the voting method.\n\nTrump has railed against mail-in voting, claiming without evidence that it is \u201ca very dangerous thing for this country because they\u2019re cheaters.\u201d On Wednesday, he incorrectly said that Michigan \u2014 like Pennsylvania, a Rust Belt giant that is critical to the president\u2019s path to reelection \u2014 is sending absentee ballots to 7.7 million voters and threatened to withhold funding to the state \u201cif they want to go down this Voter Fraud path!\u201d\n\nThe state is sending applications, not the actual ballots, to all registered voters.\n\nPennsylvania has not sent mail-in ballot applications to all eligible voters during the primary, though some local governments, such as Allegheny County, have. Secretary of State Kathy Boockvar is open to the possibility of sending mail-in ballot applications to every voter in the general election \u201cwith the necessary additional resources,\u201d according to spokeswoman Wanda Murren. An aide to Wolf said the governor will make a determination on the idea \u201cbased on experience in the primary, as we understand county processing capacity and other factors.\u201d\n\nBoockvar also supports allowing election officials to start counting mail ballots before Election Day, but that would require action by the state Legislature.\n\n2020 Election Results Who\u2019s winning 2020?

The final day a voter can apply for such a ballot is May 26, but election administrators must receive it just a week later.\n\n\u201cThe reality is if you apply on May 26 for your mail-in ballot, there's no way we're going to get it mailed out to you and you're going to mail it back before June 2,\u201d Lawrence said.\n\nMontgomery County and other areas are putting out drop boxes so voters in that situation can deliver their ballots in person.\n\nOfficials said hiring freezes and budget cuts that have been implemented because of the pandemic are making a bad situation worse. In Philadelphia, commissioners planned to hire about 50 more employees to help process the new law permitting voting by mail. But they were able to bring in only 25 before the coronavirus hit.\n\nMayor Jim Kenney also initially proposed a $10 million increase to the City Commissioners Office this year, but withdrew the bump in a revised budget plan that he unveiled after the virus spread. Election officials throughout Pennsylvania said the $14 million allocated to the state for election assistance in the CARES Act is far from enough.\n\n\u201cWe would probably need millions in order to really adequately fulfill the huge lift,\u201d said Lisa Deeley, a Democratic Philadelphia city commissioner. \u201cMy office has been a whirlwind.\u201d\n\n", "link": "https://www.politico.com/news/2020/05/24/pennsylvania-election-nightmare-275410", "published": "2020-05-24T00:00:00", "author": ["Zach Montellaro", "Meridith Mcgraw"]}, {"title": "'I hope hand lotion doesn't cause cancer, because we've been using a lot'", "text": "To Republicans, the confirmation of a new director of national intelligence, several lifetime judicial appointments and a smattering of coronavirus hearings has been worthwhile.

Short. Daily. We take you behind the headlines and help you understand the biggest stories driving politics and policy.\n\nNot every trade group that's seen its revenue collapse has resorted to layoffs; many are weathering the pandemic relatively well. But the cuts show that Washington\u2019s influence industry is not immune to the economic pain afflicting much of the rest of the country. While much of K Street has experienced a boom as companies have rushed to hire lobbyists to help them secure relief loans, others are hurting.\n\nThe International Franchise Association laid off a dozen people \u2014 about a third of its total staff \u2014 and stopped publishing its magazine as advertising revenue evaporated. While the trade group has had some success getting members to register for its digital events, it\u2019s tougher to get sponsors for them.\n\n\u201cFranchise businesses were among the first to close and will in many cases, because of government mandated reopening schedules, they will be among the last to reopen,\u201d Robert Cresanti, the trade group's president and chief executive, said in a statement. \u201cWhile the names on the front doors are well-known brands, these locally-owned small businesses often run on very tight margins and until customers can return, IFA\u2019s revenues will likely see a similar decline.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. Travel Association, which has lobbied aggressively for more federal funding for tourism bureaus and travel industry businesses, laid off some staffers and cut pay across the board after being forced to cancel its Las Vegas trade show, according to Tori Barnes, the trade group\u2019s top lobbyist. And the NRA \u2014 which had been enduring a New York state investigation and internal power struggles before the pandemic hit \u2014 has laid off more than 60 people.\n\nSome trade groups that haven\u2019t resorted to layoffs are cutting costs elsewhere. In March, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce slashed some outside consultants, including ones assigned to CEO Tom Donohue. The consultants are on hold indefinitely. The leading business lobby also asked staffers to find ways to cut their divisions\u2019 budgets by 20 percent, according to three people familiar with the matter.\n\nIt\u2019s a jarring reversal from December, when the Chamber interviewed major New York ad agencies about airing a Super Bowl ad before dropping the idea, according to two people familiar with the matter. During a board meeting in Florida in early March, the Chamber also approved and later handed out several million dollars in bonuses to senior management right as the pandemic was heating up, according to the people.\n\nA Chamber spokesman said executive compensation is \"heavily weighted toward non-guaranteed bonuses, which are paid in March and based on prior year performance.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course, we have been reviewing and reducing outside expenditures,\" the spokesman said in a statement. \"As the world\u2019s largest organization representing the interests of businesses, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce is marshaling all of its resources to help as many businesses, families and industries as possible endure the financial hardships caused by the pandemic and return to work in a safe and sustainable way.\u201d\n\nEven some trade groups that are doing well are playing it safe.", "link": "https://www.politico.com/news/2020/05/23/lobbyists-layoffs-274518", "published": "2020-05-23T00:00:00", "author": []}, {"title": "Coronavirus Dispatch: The Confusion in Reopening", "text": "", "link": "https://www.politico.com/video/2020/05/23/coronavirus-dispatch-the-confusion-in-reopening-076047", "published": "2020-05-23T00:00:00", "author": []}, {"title": "The Netflix Show The Pentagon Can\u2019t Stop Talking About", "text": "The battle within\n\nFrom the opening of the show, the backstabbing and turf battles that go on inside the corridors of the Pentagon are torqued for maximum comical effect. But they will also resonate with anyone who paid close attention to the slugfest that went on behind the scenes to establish the real Space Force\u2014which hasn\u2019t been exempt from the parochialism that runs through American military institutions.\n\nThe Air Force early on tried mightily to smother the Space Force in its crib, out of fear of losing a key mission and billions of dollars. (The Space Force\u2019s real head himself, Gen. John Raymond, would probably like to forget the op-ed he wrote opposing the idea of a dedicated space branch when he was still in the Air Force.)\n\nIn Naird\u2019s alternate world, the battle is still raging against his nemesis, the Air Force chief of staff, who constantly picks on him and his new service and plots ways to get the mission and its budget back.\n\nThe Army, meanwhile, only wishes it could stuff both the Air Force\u2014and the Space Force with it\u2014back in from whence they came. (The Air Force was split from the Army in 1947.)\n\nIn a candid conversation this month, Air Force chief of staff Gen. David Goldfein insisted that his service has buried the hatchet with the Space Force and is committed to its success. (As it happens, Naird\u2019s fictional biography parallels Goldfein\u2019s, particularly his experience being shot down over Serbia in 1999.) But Goldfein, as he looks to the future, also acknowledged that fully healing the rifts is far from guaranteed.\n\n\u201cThe test question that will be asked is, \u2018What did we build?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if we get this right, we will build two services \u2026 built on a foundation of trust and confidence. \u2026 If we get it wrong, it is shame on us. We will allow this to become some kind of divisive split.\u201d\n\nA billion-dollar boondoggle\n\nThe show also doubles down on the widely held perception that the Space Force is just another black hole for taxpayer dollars.\n\nMembers of Congress are portrayed as wanting to know why Space Force exists; they express sticker shock at its sprawling Colorado headquarters and pet programs. On the show, a prominent liberal lawmaker grills Naird on how its massive budget will help her constituents who are on food stamps. Further feeding the perception is a hawkish congressman who is eager to give the new branch whatever it desires. At one point, Malkovich\u2019s character carps that he is starring in an infomercial for the arms industry (two marquee Pentagon contractors get name-checked in one scene; one of them won\u2019t like it).\n\nIn reality, the Space Force\u2019s initial budget request was a measly $15 billion, which is a fraction of the budgets for other branches of the military. (The total annual defense budget is more than $700 billion.) Both Democrats and Republicans have worried about bankrolling a branch that could end up being wasteful and duplicative, so its relatively small price tag was crucial for the Trump administration to get buy-in on Capitol Hill.\n\nIt was also a way for the Air Force, which will still carry out many of the management and support functions of the Space Force, to keep the new branch from gobbling up too much of its authority\u2014especially its power to acquire more new satellites, rockets and other space systems. Much of the rank and file of the Space Force, at least initially, will be transfers from the Air Force.\n\nAnd the real Space Force has been authorized to grow to only 16,000 total personnel, which also pales in comparison to the Army, Navy, Air Force or Marine Corps, which together total some 2 million personnel. \u201cWe\u2019ve got about a hundred, I\u2019m gonna say 110 people, on staff,\u201d Lt. Gen. Thompson, the second in command of the Space Force, told me. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be a very small and lean headquarters organization.\u201d\n\nThe devilish details\n\nSome of the TV show's biggest laughs come at the expense of the military\u2019s idiosyncrasies\u2014its obsessive regimen, its rigid adherence to process and protocol, and its well-earned reputation for intolerance to new ways of thinking. The show also nails the extreme preoccupation of the Pentagon with the threat posed by China and the arm's length, increasingly uneasy relationship with Russia.\n\nThe show, created by Carell and Greg Daniels, who also was behind \u201cThe Office,\u201d manages to avoid the pitfalls that often turn military viewers off: They don't do stupid things like call Marines \u201csoldiers\u201d; close observers of the sneak peeks have noted how even the ribbons on Naird\u2019s uniform are spot on.\n\n\u201cSpace Force\u201d also captures in sidesplitting fashion some of the most enduring stereotypes of the military: the profligate Air Force that puts ostrich-leather seats in its stealth fighter; the numbskull killing machine who runs the Marine Corps; the elitist but foulmouthed chief of naval operations who swears like a sailor; and the humorless and narrow-minded Army chief of staff. Of course, the poor Coast Guard still can\u2019t get any respect; it ends up the target of more ridicule than even the Space Force.\n\nBut the show\u2019s portrayal of military stereotypes is anything but one-dimensional. It is the generals, including Naird himself, who sometimes have to talk the trigger-happy civilians out of a major escalation they warn could spin out of control. There are other flourishes that go well beyond military stereotypes: For example, any base commander who watches the show will thoroughly enjoy the lengths Space Force has to go to protect the wildlife that also lives on the base.\n\nIndeed, amid the jokes, \u201cSpace Force\u201d is surprisingly insightful at a time when military culture is as foreign to many Americans as other planets. It poignantly depicts the emotional toll of military life for military families\u2014not simply the sacrifices of those wearing the uniform. While Carell\u2019s character is often portrayed as a buffoon, there are more than a few glimmers of why he has been chosen as the leader. And it makes a pretty solid case for why space inspires so much hope.\n\n\u201cI think part of the reason we're excited about it is it just represents the enthusiasm, the excitement, and the focus and the attention\u2014sort of a rebirth in terms of space,\u201d says Thompson, the second-in-command of the real Space Force. \u201cYou know, there's a long history of comedy associated with the military and the armed services. I think, you know, we as a culture are sophisticated enough to understand comedy and satire and the desire to enjoy those parts of life and the very serious business we\u2019re engaged in every day.\u201d\n\nPeter Garretson, a retired Air Force lieutenant colonel, is a former military space strategist\u2014and one who is eagerly awaiting the Netflix take. \u201cThe creators of the show have an amazing platform to educate America about a number of issues,\u201d he says, \u201cfrom military organization to anti-satellite weapons and international law. Even if it\u2019s a comedy, the potential for people to see those things interact could actually be quite useful. I think they probably realize at this point that there are fewer people in the Space Force than there are on the cast and the crew of the show.\u201d", "link": "https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/05/23/space-force-netflix-steve-carell-274951", "published": "2020-05-23T00:00:00", "author": []}, {"title": "The Presidential Race Florida Is Really Talking About", "text": "Emergency management, however, is an area that Scott has used to boost his political capital. He successfully navigated the state through Hurricanes Maria and Irma during his eight years as governor, all while wearing a blue Navy hat, a nod to his military service that became part of Scott\u2019s political brand. Hurricane Michael, which leveled parts of the Florida panhandle, pulled Scott from the campaign trail in October 2018, earning him limitless media attention in the midst of a nationally watched Senate race.\n\n\u201cThis is gold for Rick Scott,\u201d said Brad Coker, a pollster with Mason-Dixon Polling & Strategy, at the time. \u201cIt gives him the chance to raise his profile and show he can execute under pressure.

This is where Scott\u2019s reputation for being surgical with a political shank comes into play. The former governor has taken a few stabs at DeSantis\u2019 performance during the response.\n\nIn the early portions of the crisis, Scott sent out daily charts without any context showing the coronavirus\u2019 growth on a percentage basis in Florida and other states (the numbers were not good), and called the early lack of communication out of DeSantis\u2019 administration \u201calarming.\u201d Scott\u2019s team has grown accustomed to pushing back against the implication that he is feuding with DeSantis, but the hits keep coming.\n\nAt a pandemic-related press conference in Fort Lauderdale, Vice President Mike Pence is joined by (left-right): Sen.

Though that plan gained little traction, it was noticed because it stepped on the messaging of the sitting governor, who generally leads the state\u2019s emergency management response.\n\nRubio has also urged caution, saying things like more contact tracing, antiviral coronavirus treatments and specific social-distancing measures should be in place before things open back up. But unlike Scott\u2019s jabs, nothing Rubio has said has indicated he was trying to score points at DeSantis\u2019 expense. Instead, he took a more direct route at self-promotion.\n\nOne of Rubio\u2019s biggest official roles has been as chairman of the usually sleepy Small Business Committee, which crafted $377 million in funding for small businesses that was a key cog in Congress\u2019 first $2 trillion coronavirus economic stimulus bill. That role gave Rubio a national \u201cnext act.\u201d He used it to make a splash.\n\n\u201cAm I interested in potentially running for president one day? Sure, absolutely, because I ran once before. I don\u2019t know if I will,\u201d he told POLITICO in April. \u201cI don\u2019t know what the world is going to look like in four, five, six years or what my life is going to look like.\u201d\n\nMaybe one of DeSantis\u2019 most significant 2024 moves came in another national swing state before he was even governor.\n\nIn 2017, DeSantis and a handful campaign staffers flew to Las Vegas for a meeting that they had been seeking for months with a donor who had the ability to singlehandedly change the trajectory of his race: Sheldon Adelson, the billionaire casino magnate. This was especially important for DeSantis, who despite his Ivy League pedigree comes from a working-class family in west central Florida and lacks the built-in donor network or vast personal wealth of someone like Rick Scott.\n\nWalking into the room at Adelson\u2019s Venetian hotel, DeSantis had an in with a man that every Republican presidential aspirant courts in what is known inside GOP circles as the \u201cSheldon Adelson primary.\u201d The winner, who was nearly Rubio in 2016, gets access to tens of millions of dollars and, equally as important, immediate national viability.\n\nCasino magnate and Republican mega-donor Sheldon Adelson awaits the arrival of President Trump at a Feb 2020 campaign rally in Las Vegas. | AP\n\nAs a member of Congress, DeSantis was a hard-line supporter of Israel\u2014Adelson\u2019s most passionate cause\u2014and he ran for governor on a platform that included a promise to be the nation\u2019s \u201cmost pro-Israel governor.\u201d When DeSantis got his meeting, the focus was not business or politics.\n\n\u201cSitting in that room they were talking about, like, Bedouin tribes of Israel pre-biblical era,\u201d said one aide who was at the meeting. \u201cI\u2019m not even sure I\u2019m saying it right, it was just so esoteric. Sheldon knew exactly what [DeSantis] was saying, but everyone else in the room was lost.\u201d\n\nAdelson ultimately helped lead DeSantis\u2019 finance team, a group that included a collection of conservative ideologically aligned national billionaires that normally would not play in a Florida\u2019s governor\u2019s race. \u201cThat initial list was a group of people who signal national aspirations,\u201d said a DeSantis campaign adviser.\n\nBut DeSantis\u2019 success with Adelson is a conspicuous exception in his fundraising. He is notorious for his poor skills tending to the run-of-the-mill millionaires who populate the national fundraising circuit. Multiple people who spoke to POLITICO said DeSantis lacks what is known in campaign parlance as \u201cdonor maintenance\u201d\u2014knowing something about your donors, calling them on their birthdays, sending them a note when their kid graduates from college.\n\n\u201cWe would try to tell him you need to call these people other than when you are asking them for money,\u201d said one former campaign aide. \u201cThat is a huge maintenance problem.

Indeed, even as Trump stuck predominantly to the script on Thursday, portraying himself as the fireman who had ventured into a state smoldering with rage and anxiety, the scent of kerosene followed close behind. Just 24 hours before he arrived in Michigan, the president launched a dangerous disinformation campaign, accusing the secretary of state of going \u201crogue\u201d by illegally sending absentee ballots to every Michigan voter. He threatened to block funding to Michigan\u2014a state beleaguered by multiple converging disasters, including one that was unfolding just as the tweet was sent\u2014\u201cif they want to go down this Voter Fraud path!\u201d\n\nTo be clear, none of this is accurate. Voters were sent applications to vote absentee, a practice consistent with a newly adopted Michigan law (a law that exists in other states, red and blue alike). The Michigan GOP has itself sent out applications. There is nothing sordid or illegitimate going on; both parties here understand the rules of the game and are attempting to master them before November.\n\nBut Trump is playing his own game.

If she were really sick of the enterprise, wouldn\u2019t she just fold it completely or sell her share? Instead, she\u2019s been expanding the company\u2019s footprint. Just two years ago, Atlantic Media commenced a 100-person hiring spree that increased its head count by 30 percent, so today\u2019s reductions aren\u2019t quite as draconian as they sound. Last fall, well before the contagion announced itself, the Atlantic erected a paywall and began to push harder for subscriber revenue, which produced reports of success from Editor-in-Chief Jeffrey Goldberg. Jobs was clearly signaling then that she didn\u2019t mind subsidizing your reading habits, but that she wasn't prepared to foot the whole bill.\n\nJudging from Bradley\u2019s layoff memo, few editorial positions have been cut, which, as the occupant of an editorial position and a reader of the Atlantic, I commend. The majority of terminations appear to be in the events division\u2014which he says has been undone \u201covernight\u201d by the pandemic\u2014and sales and video. Solid severance packages, the Bradley memo tells us, are being dispensed, which is good. (Bradley sticks his foot in it at least once in the memo, though. \u201cThis morning, we are informing 68 of our colleagues that we will not have a place for them on The Atlantic\u2019s new course,\u201d he writes, making it sound as if he\u2019s issuing the mass cancellation of airline reservations, not giving employees the sack.)\n\nIn a smartly argued Thursday posting, Media Nut newsletter writer Josh Sternberg connects the Atlantic Media layoffs to the general diminution of the journalism business. \u201cWe\u2019re going to see national newspapers tighten their belts as ad revenue continues to nosedive. We\u2019re going to see digital outlets and print publications go out of business. Media companies will have to do some serious soul searching,\u201d he writes. The soul searching extends to events, Sternberg counsels. That Atlantic Media\u2014which helped pioneer the events business and was producing 100 of the confabs a year\u2014is now retreating presages the collapse of an entire subindustry that has been thriving for more than a decade. Which publication\u2019s events business will fall next? The New Yorker\u2019s? The Wall Street Journal\u2019s?\n\nVanity press moguls tend not to give up their media businesses all at once but in stages, as I\u2019ve written before. That said, I see nothing in today\u2019s announcement that hints that Jobs has grown weary of the media game after three years playing it, or that she is making plans to flush the Atlantic.

Most people still don\u2019t feel it\u2019s safe to visit aging relatives. Baseball has yet to have opening day.\n\nBut political culture has returned to something close to its pre-pandemic state. People are filled with resentment and malice toward their fellow citizens. They are arguing over eccentric or ephemeral controversies. They are sanctimoniously and often hypocritically denouncing the sanctimoniousness and hypocrisy of their opponents. Above all, many influential voices across the ideological spectrum are united in the assumption that the most important subjectconstant and all-consuming\u2014to be thinking and talking about is Trump.\n\nHere is the essence of the Trump Trap. For critics, not speaking out against his provocations could be reasonably interpreted as complicity or cowardice. Speaking out, however, gives those provocations the centrality upon which the Trump movement depends. It\u2019s an old phenomenon. What\u2019s new is the pandemic, which looked for a while like it might make Trump\u2019s brand of politics obsolete. Instead, it has proven the adaptability and durability of Trumpism. His immediate predecessor, like many other Democrats and much of the media, has ratified the achievement.\n\nObama\u2019s return this month is a good window also into an underappreciated dynamic of the Trump years.\n\nSouth River High School senior Isabel McGuire, center, is flanked by her parents as they watch former President Barack Obama address the high school Class of 2020 on television in their home in Maryland on Saturday. | Susan Walsh/AP Photo\n\nAt first glance, this looks like two powerful political leaders with large followings expressing their disdain for each other on more or less equal terms. But the nature of Obama\u2019s command of the loyalty and affection of his supporters is far different than the nature of Trump\u2019s command of his supporters. This difference is critical to the most important question of 2020 politics: Can Trump survive the pandemic and the astounding disruption it has caused in the economy and the routines of everyday life?\n\nMost people who admire Obama, it\u2019s clear, do so in absolute terms. To these people, his character and style represent virtues that approximate the ideal of how they might wish all presidents at all times should act. He\u2019s progressive, even if not quite as much as some admirers want. He values rationality and restraint, a bit more so than many partisans would wish\u2014an elegant and inspirational figure in an inelegant and cynical age. These virtues, by these lights, do not depend primarily on context\u2014on who his opponents are, or what external circumstances he is facing.\n\nMost people who admire Trump, in my conversations, do so in a relative way. Context is everything. Yes, they say, Trump is coarse and combative, often outrageous, with a wandering attention span. No, this does not represent their ideal of how a president should act. But these aren\u2019t ideal times\u2014they are infused with double standards and cynicism\u2014and this makes Trump a great leader for these particular times. He calls out institutions (political parties, Congress, the media) who his partisans don\u2019t believe deserve their respect or influence. He gratuitously offends liberal pieties. He is not boring, and he\u2019s not afraid.\n\nIt's often said that Trump\u2019s brand of politics requires him to identify enemies\u2014people want to see who he\u2019s against. What\u2019s overlooked is Trump\u2019s brand of politics requires other people to identify him as the enemy. There\u2019s never a shortage of volunteers, and none more prestigious than a former Democratic president widely respected by his party. Democrats were pleased to hear Obama\u2019s words of condemnation. But Trump was even more pleased. No one could doubt that Obama sincerely believed his comparatively mild rebuke of Trump. No one really doubts that whether Trump believes his broadsides against Obama is secondary to his true objective of drawing lines and creating the kind of chaos in which he has previously thrived.\n\nThe rejoinder to all this is obvious: Who cares? What relevance do Trump\u2019s grievances and posturing and conspiracy theories have in the middle of a pandemic? Surely there is only one question that matters: Is Trump doing a good job responding to the crisis?\n\nBut that question immediately leads to the next: Good job, according to who?\n\nTrump knows that the likelihood that a sufficient number of people will say he\u2019s doing at least an acceptable job during the pandemic increases the more that certain types of people say he\u2019s a terrible person doing a terrible job.\n\nDemocrats believe the pandemic and Trump\u2019s belated and erratic response to it will be his undoing. There is polling to bolster this hope. A Quinnipiac poll released Wednesday showed Joe Biden leading Trump by 50 percent to 39 percent in a head-to-head matchup\u2014an 11-point national lead that, if it held, likely would put several battleground states out of reach for Trump.\n\nBut weighing against hope is experience. Democrats have yet to be validated, not after the Billy Bush tape in 2016, not after the Ukraine revelations of 2019, that there is a \u201cthis time he\u2019s gone too far\u201d moment that will cause Trump backers to mournfully turn their support away from him.\n\nSo far, there is no evidence that a galvanizing rhetorical moment\u2014such as Joseph Welch in 1954 challenging Joe McCarthy, \u201cHave you no sense of decency, sir? At long last, have you left no sense of decency?\u201d\u2014will derail Trump. There is plenty of evidence, on the other hand, that being told Trump is bad causes some people to think he is good.\n\nEven so, the eternal belief in some precincts is that American politics will finally pivot when just the right person finds just the right words to pierce the Trump Movement.\n\nObama surely understands the Trump Trap. Likely he also believes that at some point political leaders risk losing their moral authority and claim on public attention if they don\u2019t say what they think. Nancy Pelosi also understands the Trump Trap. Democrats won the 2018 elections by stressing new reforms for health care over denunciations of Trump. But she also knows the trap is hard to resist, as when she explained this week that she called Trump morbidly obese because she wanted to give him \u201ca dose of his own medicine.\u201d Democratic nominee Joe Biden on Wednesday mocked Trump as \u201cPresident Tweety,\u201d but generally has resisted trying to match his much more theatrical opponent insult for insult.\n\nMost partisans don\u2019t have or aspire to that restraint, and accept a role as essential supporting actors in his show.\n\nThe latest example is this week\u2019s uproar over Trump supposedly taking hydroxychloroquine, medically unsupported for use as treatment or prophylaxis against Covid-19. If Trump really is taking the stuff, which some critics doubt, one can see why that might be a bad idea from his perspective. Logically, however, it\u2019s not clear why people who dislike Trump should be outraged. \u201cOh, no, he might get sick and we need his leadership.\u201d I haven\u2019t heard anyone sincerely say that. \u201cI\u2019m mad because when I first heard him prattling on about the stuff I really got my hopes up but it turns out he didn\u2019t know what he was talking about.\u201d I don\u2019t think there are very many such people. Probably there are some people who genuinely are worried on behalf of Trump supporters. \u201cI\u2019ve got friends and relatives who I like even though we disagree about politics and I could imagine some of them actually following Trump\u2019s lead.\u201d\n\nBut let\u2019s be honest: People outraged by Trump and hydroxychloroquine are mostly offended on their own behalf, not other people\u2019s. He utterly shocks their sensibilities about how a president is supposed to act, with caution and deference to the counsel of experts. Which is precisely the reason Trump takes, or claims to take, the drug.\n\nIn just the past several days, Trump has suggested that Biden is suffering from senility, lashed out at governors who he says aren\u2019t opening up their states fast enough, and called MSNBC news host Joe Scarborough \u201cPsycho Joe\u201d and implied that the former member of Congress may be connected to a \u201ccold case\u201d 20 years ago involving the death of a woman who worked in his office, even though the medical examiner said this isn\u2019t a \u201ccold case\u201d at all but was long ago ruled an accident.\n\nThe barrage of allegations does not reflect a president confident about his political standing. But it doesn\u2019t necessarily reflect a president who has lost self-control and has no idea what he\u2019s doing. He\u2019s trying to get American politics back to normal, as he understands the word. At least in some narrow ways he knows it\u2019s working.\n\n", "link": "https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/05/21/obama-trump-altitude-272702", "published": "2020-05-21T00:00:00", "author": []}, {"title": "Opinion | It\u2019s OK to Acknowledge Good Covid-19 News", "text": "The press has a natural affinity for catastrophes, which make compelling viewing and good copy. The pandemic is indeed a once-in-a-generation story. So the media is naturally loath to shift gears and acknowledge that the coronavirus has begun to loosen its grip.\n\nMeanwhile, progressives and many journalists have developed a near-theological commitment to the lockdowns, such that any information that undermines them is considered unwelcome, even threatening. This accounts for the widespread sense that no one should say things have gotten better ... or people are going to die.\n\nUsually when it is thought the public can\u2019t handle the truth, it is a truth about some threat that could spark panic. In this case, the truth is information that might make people think it\u2019s safe to go outside again.\n\nAlmost all the discussion about reopening is framed by worries that we will reopen too soon, not that we might reopen too late\u2014that is literally unthinkable.\n\nNone of this is to minimize the seriousness of this pandemic. New York and its surrounding suburbs have been through hell. What\u2019s happened in the country\u2019s nursing homes is a tragedy. We want to be cautious about reopening\u2014as even the most forward-leaning governors have been\u2014and vigilant about new outbreaks.\n\nBut we have entered a new phase. As Nate Silver pointed out on Tuesday, the seven-day rolling average for deaths is 1,362, down from 1,761 the week prior and a peak of 2,070 on April 21. That\u2019s still much too high, but the trend is favorable.\n\nTesting capacity, such a concern for so long, has really begun to expand after hitting a plateau for weeks. Testing nationally on some days has been in the high 300,000s or (on May 17) over 400,000. The issue in some states now is not capacity but actually finding enough people to test.\n\nScott Gottlieb of the American Enterprise Institute notes that the positivity rate, or percentage of people testing positive, has continued to fall throughout May. In New York City, the country\u2019s epicenter, the positivity rate was below 5 percent as of the middle of the week.\n\nThe reopenings could certainly still go awry, but so far there is no clear indication of it. Cases are still falling in Austria, Denmark and Norway, despite those countries being relatively far along on reopening. Denmark has been mystified why it is almost five weeks into reopening and hasn\u2019t yet seen increases in infections.\n\nOn Tuesday, Georgia, so widely criticized for its reopening, had its lowest number of Covid-19 patients in the hospital since April 8, when such data began being reported. The number has dropped 12 percent since the week before, and 34 percent since May 1.\n\nThe press has often, out of sloppiness or willfulness, tried to create negative news around the reopenings. CNN tweeted last weekend, \u201cTexas is seeing the highest number of new coronavirus cases and deaths just two weeks after it officially re-opened.\u201d As Sean Trende of RealClearPolitics pointed out, the seven-day rolling average of new cases had indeed been trending up, but the seven-day rolling average of the number of tests had gone up, too\u2014which would naturally turn up more cases.\n\nThe key indicator is the positivity rate, and it was down in Texas.\n\nA North Carolina TV station tweeted, \u201cBreaking News: NC sees largest spike in coronavirus cases since pandemic began.\u201d That referred to 800 new cases over the past 24 hours on May 16. But tests had been going sharply up and the positivity rate trending down. Hospitalizations were basically flat.\n\nThe other day, headlines noted that Florida recorded 500 new cases on one day. It generated fewer headlines, and perhaps none, when Gov. Ron DeSantis pointed out that the state had received a dump of 75,000 test results, yielding the 500 new cases, for a minuscule positivity rate of 0.64 percent.\n\nIt\u2019s not as though we haven\u2019t had a cataract of unassailably legitimate bad news over the past few months. We\u2019ve been experiencing a wrenching public health crisis and a steep recession on top of it. There shouldn\u2019t be a need to obscure favorable trends.

He also, and even more disastrously, wanted to compete directly with the bigger, better, richer National Football League by playing games in the fall instead of the spring, and he didn\u2019t want to wait\u2014even after outside consultants penned a report recommending that the USFL stick with the spring slate, and slow, steady growth.

The hydroxychloroquine confession didn\u2019t displace the IG story from the news, but it wasn\u2019t expected to. Both the New York Times and Washington Post made Trump\u2019s dreams come true by putting the story on Page One of their Tuesday editions (Times: \u201cPresident Says He Takes Drug Deemed a Risk\u201d; Post: \u201cTrump Says He\u2019s Taking Unproven Medication\u201d) and after being featured on Monday cable news the talking heads were still gabbing about it on Tuesday afternoon as he hyped the drug anew during a press spray.

Should we be worried or not? Some were cavalier. \u201cIt\u2019s a bunch of nonsense,\u201d said Masha, the owner of a big friendly mutt. Others were worried, especially if they had health problems or, like one neighbor, a newborn grandchild at home. And we were all worried about the dozen or so small businesses that had appeared on our block in the past couple years \u2014 especially because some of the owners were our neighbors.\n\nAlexander, the owner of a big white boxer, has a nail salon in the building next to us. He was worried. The ruble had already tumbled against the dollar and euro. To be on the safe side, he had borrowed some money from a friend and bought a large stockpile of imported materials. And then he waited. But not for long. Just about a week later, Sobyanin, the Moscow mayor, ordered all nonessential stores and services to close, including Alexander\u2019s nail salon.\n\nIn other countries, salons might have closed immediately. But Alexander was worried about his staff. He called them in to discuss their options, and they decided to take the opposite approach, to keep the salon open late every night until the cutoff date, March 28, so that they could earn enough money to hold them over for a week or so. That was almost two months ago. The salon has been closed since.\n\nAlexander and his wife have other jobs that provide basic income. He thinks some of his staff are earning money doing house calls, and others are just waiting it out. Even when he can reopen, he doesn\u2019t really know how to reopen. \u201cIt\u2019s a question of safety for the staff and customers. I can figure out how to keep two meters between customers, but when will people feel safe and confident enough to come in?\u201d He thinks it may be a year or more before he can recoup losses and pay off the debt in rent he is running up.\n\nAnother neighbor and dog owner Sergei runs a specialty shop. He used to get 35 to 50 orders a day; now it\u2019s two or three. \u201cMy landlord lowered the rent by 40 percent, but that doesn\u2019t help much when income has fallen by 90 percent,\u201d he told me.\n\nI asked Nikolai Petrov, a senior research fellow on the Russia and Eurasia Program at Chatham House in London and professor in the political science department at the Higher School of Economics in Moscow, why he thought Putin was willing to risk alienating voters like Alexander and Sergei.\n\nPetrov said Putin didn\u2019t need their support. \u201cAuthoritarian regimes rely on important people who are key to stability and staying in power,\u201d he said. \u201cPutin\u2019s political base is the big companies, banks and state companies. He doesn\u2019t depend on citizens, so he doesn\u2019t see or hear those 10 or 15 or 20 percent of the population who are really suffering today from the measures to fight Covid.\u201d\n\nOn May 11, Putin announced that the \u201cnational vacation\u201d that had begun in March would end the next day, but that each regional leader would determine how and when to open up businesses. In Moscow, Sobyanin announced that the lockdown would continue until at least the end of the month and now include mandatory gloves and masks in public places, but that several categories of business could open. People shook their heads: Is the situation more dangerous or safer?\n\nAnd there was a new joke making the rounds: \u201cWhen we had 1,000 new infections every day, we were put on lockdown. Now that we have over 10,000 new infections every day, they\u2019re sending us back to work.\u201d\n\nThe problem is that not everyone is going back to work or working at home on salary. Small shops, businesses and services are still closed. In our neighborhood, one beauty salon \u2014 a branch of a citywide chain \u2014 closed and moved out within the first week of the lockdown. Three other shops have closed and might not reopen.\n\nWith the economic pressure mounting, Putin announced in his May address that he would increase aid to the population, mostly through direct payments to families with children, but including tax and insurance write-offs for sole proprietors and even reimbursement of income taxes paid in 2019. I asked my friends if this would help; they laughed. The first round of aid consisted mostly of benefits such as partial debt forgiveness, salary reimbursements if companies continued to pay their staff, and some tax deferments \u2014 none of which they qualified for or needed \u2014 and the current aid package wasn\u2019t enough to make up for their catastrophic loss of income and continued rent payments.\n\nBut neither Alexander nor Sergei had expected state aid. \u201cWe never thought we\u2019d get any support,\u201d Sergei said. \u201cBut that\u2019s the deal. Either you\u2019re free and are totally on your own, or you work for the state and get a salary and aid, but you also have to do what they say, go to political rallies, whatever. Better to be free.\u201d\n\nLooking ahead, it\u2019s clear that millions of small-business people, gig economy workers, waiters, salespeople, actors, dancers, musicians, museum curators, nannies, cleaners, fitness instructors and all those Russians working off the books \u2014 a large portion of the population \u2014 could come out of this with nothing. If they hold on to their businesses, they will probably have a huge debt to pay off. Many thousands, if not millions, of them could lose everything.\n\nTo some extent, given the nature of the crisis, economic pain is inevitable. Sonin says, \u201cThe crisis is unprecedented, and because the government didn\u2019t move quickly and the measures aren\u2019t, to my mind, sufficient, the downturn will be greater. But getting out of this crisis would have been difficult regardless of what Russia did.\u201d\n\nThe government\u2019s approach isn\u2019t going to improve its popularity ratings, Sonin says, but adds, \u201cI don\u2019t think there is a risk of great discontent. In 2008 and 2009, the GDP fell by 9 percent, and the majority of households were cutting back on basic necessities. But the public didn\u2019t rebel then, and I think it will be about the same this time.\u201d\n\nNor does he think this crisis, however difficult, will spur Russian leadership to change: \u201cThere is no discussion of reconsidering priorities, like cutting back on defense spending, security, or propaganda, or repealing the countersanctions, which in my view would have been the first thing to do. There is no discussion of any of that. That\u2019s not being done because they think the way things are is the way the things ought to be.\u201d", "link": "https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/05/19/moscow-coronavirus-vladimir-putin-265227", "published": "2020-05-19T00:00:00", "author": ["Michele A.

Could it be that the Democratic conspiracy to shut down the rallies has co-opted the Republicans, too? Or is it just a matter of Eric Trump being full of political beans? Occam\u2019s razor would suggest the latter and that the younger Trump\u2019s mouth simply got out in front of his brain and lapped it a couple of times.\n\nBut maybe Eric Trump is onto something. Maybe he isn\u2019t pitching the rally idea just as a pretext to poke his opponent in the eye. If he\u2019s sincere about thinking the rallies should go on, maybe the president shouldn\u2019t wait for an invitation. Maybe he should just browbeat one Republican governor into okaying a big rally and have him throw open an arena\u2019s doors. He might want to approach Florida\u2019s Ron DeSantis, a Republican governor who is giving some gyms and restaurants permission to open at half-capacity and has invited major sports leagues to resume play in his state. The Republican governors of Texas and Georgia, Greg Abbott and Brian Kemp, might give him a thumbs up for a rally if their efforts to restart their states is any indication of their mindsets.\n\nThink of the potential for Trump, who has chafed under the strictures of his White House press briefings. It\u2019d be like a mini vacation from the Covid-19 grind. No one would be nagging him with \u201cnasty\u201d questions about whether he was going to wear a mask on stage. No one would be wearing one. They\u2019d probably be burning masks in the parking lot! And none of that distancing either. Let the show run for a couple of hours, make sure there\u2019s lots of spittle-laden call-and-response between the president and his supporters; high-fives; low-fives; hand-crusher handshakes and not a bottle of sanitizer within sight.\n\nGood for Trump\u2019s mood and some invaluable scientific value to boot. If no one gets sick, all the MAGA-world conspiracy theories will be proven true. But if and when the Covid-19 cases arrive (and I\u2019m betting they surely would), the contract tracers could collect data for a study that shows exactly how safe a big assembly like a rally, a sporting event, or a concert really is. The main cost would be the potential deaths of dozens or maybe hundreds of Donald Trump supporters, but it\u2019s a risk Eric Trump seems willing to take. Come to think of it, the president might want to think twice about trying this in Michigan, where his margin of victory was just over 10,000 votes; how many supporters can he afford to lose?\n\nIn another Pirro show passage, Eric Trump called \u201cthe media\u201d a partner in the Democrats\u2019 strategy to use the lockdown to wound the president. The media, he said, \u201cis effectively a propaganda arm for the Democrats.\u201d\n\nWhile it\u2019s true that the liberal commentariat has backed the lockdown, it\u2019s a reach to claim reporters are getting their assignments from DNC headquarters. Even so, some of the Trump faithful have long adhered to the idea that the press works for the Democrats. In the past, the president\u2019s supporters have physically attacked journalists, most notably from the BBC, the Orlando Sentinel, and OC Weekly. Earlier this month, Trump supporters harassed reporters for wearing masks as they covered the president\u2019s visit to the Honeywell plant in Arizona. \u201cYou\u2019re on the wrong side of patriotism\u2014you\u2019re like communists,\u201d one supporter said. On May 14, a local TV reporter got heckled while covering a right-wing group\u2019s Long Island rally calling for the reopening of businesses. Trump himself encouraged the harassment when he retweeted the reporter\u2019s video account and added this commentary: \u201cPeople can\u2019t get enough of this. Great people!\u201d\n\nOn Monday, the president announced that he is taking doses of hydroxychloroquine, an anti-malarial drug that he has touted as a treatment and a prophylaxis for the coronavirus. \u201cGood things are being said about it,\u201d Trump said, despite multiple reports that it has limited to no effect and might even be harmful in combination with other drugs. As a way to strengthen the bond between himself and his supporters, Trump could pass out complimentary pills to the audience at his rallies. What could go wrong?\n\n******\n\nDoes hydroxychloroquine come in a blisterpak? Send prescriptions to [email protected]. My email alerts are on ventilators. My Twitter feed is taking zinc.

That\u2019s Going to Be a Problem.", "text": "The cumulative effect is devastating. In Outliers, the journalist Malcolm Gladwell wrote, \u201cvirtually all of the advantage that wealthy students have over poor students is the result of differences in the way privileged students learn when they are not in school.\u201d As Gladwell put it: \u201cAmerica doesn\u2019t have a school problem. It has a summer vacation problem.\u201d\n\nThis is about to become the longest summer vacation in American history, which means we can expect the biggest \u201csummer slide\u201d we\u2019ve ever seen. We can either rise to the challenge, and perhaps even reform American education for the better, or leave an entire generation of children behind.\n\nWhen the coronavirus pandemic struck, the achievement gap between poor and rich students in America had never been greater. According to research by Stanford\u2019s Sean Reardon, among children born in the mid-1990s, the gap in standardized test scores between children from high-income families (defined as the 90th percentile of the income distribution and above) and kids from low-income families (10th percentile and below) was roughly 1.25 standard deviations. That\u2019s 40 percent larger than it was among children born in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s. By comparison, racial and ethnic achievement gaps narrowed over the same period.\n\nSummer slides are especially pernicious because their effects are cumulative. By the time a student gets to middle school, they\u2019ve lost an average of two years to summer slide. At higher grade levels, the effect grows even stronger. Ninety percent of teachers say they have to reteach material after school reopens in the fall. The consequences of a six-month summer vacation are almost impossible to imagine.\n\nMoreover, the effects of summer slide extend far beyond testing outcomes. For example, low-income students who experience the greatest summer learning loss are more likely to drop out of high school. That\u2019s because lapses in school not only produce losses in learning, but, as Alexander and his colleagues wrote, also \u201closses in health and well-being, college and career opportunity, and support needed to break cycles of inter-generational poverty and move young people and their families forward.\u201d\n\nLearning opportunities and life outcomes are deeply and complexly interrelated, and the relationship works in both directions. Everyone understands today, if they didn\u2019t already, that disparities in health outcomes are the product of many factors. Economically disadvantaged people are, of course, less likely to have health insurance. They\u2019re also more likely to have diabetes, heart disease, and breathe bad air\u2014all of which are risk factors for Covid-19.\n\nEducational outcomes are similarly multifactorial. In the best circumstances, to learn well a student needs good food, a sense of well-being, enough money to afford books and transportation, and a reasonably stable support structure. Now add to that list a high-speed internet connection, a decent computer, a quiet space where they can close the door and be free from distractions, and a schedule that allows them to work on the teacher\u2019s timetable.\n\nNone of my students have everything on that list. Many don\u2019t even have one. If one acknowledges this reality, it becomes obvious that this will be a formidable problem to solve.\n\nAnother daunting dynamic of the crisis is the lag between actions taken now and their later consequences. It\u2019s part of what makes it so tough to slow down coronavirus. People going to beaches today will cause a spike in infection in two weeks, but because the data lags, people don\u2019t perceive the connection. Education data is even slower\u2014the lag is counted in years, not weeks. With standardized testing suspended in many states, it may be half a decade or more before we know the full cost of this tragedy.\n\nBut as certainly as epidemiologists know that relaxing social distancing measures will cause people to die, we know that closing schools will cause economically disadvantaged students to fall further behind. All students will suffer, but the poorest students will suffer the most.\n\nAnd it might not just be one six-month summer vacation. Some schools are likely to remain closed in the next academic year. Others will remain online for the foreseeable future. Students of limited means may decide to forswear traditional schools in favor of less expensive online degrees. Our already massive educational inequalities are about to get far, far worse. Today\u2019s elementary students will be in my college classroom in a decade. Without immediate action, the resulting gap in educational outcomes will be impossible to repair.\n\nNeedless to say, a problem of this magnitude doesn\u2019t lend itself to a single, easy solution, but it\u2019s at least possible to imagine the outline of a constructive approach to mitigating these disparities.\n\nA first step is to recognize the importance of synchronous learning. Platforms like Zoom, which I\u2019ve used for years, create an opportunity for students to interact with their peers. So much of what teachers provide\u2014even at the college level\u2014is an environment for social and emotional learning. For that to occur, there needs to be interpersonal group contact. Synchronous learning also provides a structure to the day that\u2019s essential, especially for younger students. Traditionally, that\u2019s been shaped by classrooms and schools. Now it needs to be replicated online.\n\nBut online learning requires Internet access, and digital inequality is a national problem. In New York City, 300,000 students live in homes without a computer. CUNY, like many public colleges, has made heroic efforts to educate its students. In late March, the university closed for a brief recalibration period to remedy, as best it could, inequities in access to technology. Even while facing budget shortfalls, within a week CUNY distributed 30,000 laptops and moved almost all of its classes online.\n\nStill, a laptop doesn\u2019t solve the problem; students also need connectivity. More than 12 million children don\u2019t have Internet access at home, and nearly a quarter of teenagers from impoverished homes say they lack a reliable Internet connection or computer. Furthermore, Zoom doesn\u2019t work especially well without a high-speed data connection. Many elite colleges have been unwilling to fund Internet access for low-income students. With libraries and Starbucks off limits, it\u2019s time to realize that a computer isn\u2019t much use without a WiFi hotspot to go with it. FCC Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel has recommended using its Universal Service Fund, which historically has been dedicated to helping schools pay for high-speed broadband connection, to reimburse schools and libraries for the purchase and loaning out of Wi-Fi hotspots to students who lack adequate access. This would be a good start.\n\nSecond, schools at every level need to stop using homework as a substitute for classroom learning. At the onset of the pandemic, no one knew for sure how long the school shutdowns would last. To get through a couple of weeks, it might make sense to send home assignments as a stopgap strategy.\n\nBut simply posting assignments overwhelms students and parents, and it exacerbates achievement gaps because some parents can manage better than others. Even in the best of circumstances\u2014when homework is used strategically to reinforce concepts taught in school\u2014homework disadvantages poorer students. Schools that are relying on home assignments without accompanying teaching will see large drops in achievement. I\u2019m shocked that even at top colleges, many professors are relying heavily or evenly exclusively on assignments.\n\nThird, schools and the communities around them need to start thinking much more creatively about how they use their space and resources. Right now, with classes cancelled, schools are underutilized behemoths. Can we repurpose these physical structures to support online learning? Colleges and high schools may not be able to open to the entire community, but they easily can create socially distanced spaces that could be utilized by students without Internet access.\n\nSimilarly, the traditional division of the school day into periods makes a lot of sense when you\u2019re moving thousands of people from one place to another inside a building or on a campus, but no one\u2019s moving around a school right now. Instead of offering calculus third and fifth period, how about offering one section during the day and another at night, taught by different teachers with different family needs? Or, better still, flip the classroom and let students learn at their own pace.", "link": "https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/05/17/long-summer-students-coronavirus-259201", "published": "2020-05-17T00:00:00", "author": ["Evan Mandery", "A Professor At John Jay College Of Criminal Justice", "Is The Author Of"]}, {"title": "Opinion | What Liberals Don\u2019t Get About Trump Supporters and Pop Culture", "text": "Implicit to those questions is the assertion that either the Trump campaign and its supporters are so oblivious to \u201cStar Wars,\u201d the most ubiquitous pop culture phenomenon of the past 50 years, that they don\u2019t know how it ends, or so incomprehensibly illiterate as cultural consumers that they don\u2019t understand George Lucas\u2019 fictional Empire is meant to be the baddies.\n\nThe real explanation is much simpler and more believable: When Parscale and his ilk approvingly identify themselves with pre-redemption Darth Vader, or Thanos, or even Dr. Evil, they surely understand those characters\u2019 morality perfectly well. It\u2019s not so much that Trump, et. al actively identify as \u201cvillains,\u201d but that the behavior that makes one a \u201cvillain\u201d in fiction\u2014deceit, wanton rule-breaking, a willful disregard for collateral damage\u2014is, in real life, more likely to get one branded a \u201cwinner,\u201d provided one plays their cards right. Enron executives? Elizabeth Holmes? The steroid-juicing baseball heroes of the 1990s? Winners all\u2014at least until they got caught.\n\nThrough that lens, everything from the Justice Department dropping charges against Michael Flynn post-guilty plea, to the president\u2019s continued enrichment from his various hotels and business entities (to much worse) is as justifiable as the destruction of Alderaan. Rule-bound critics across the ideological spectrum can cry and moan as much as they want; the Trump administration has the power, is #winning and will do as it pleases, until they\u2019re similarly caught red-handed. (To the extent that remains a possibility\u2014the insulation from accountability provided by such magnificent power as the presidency is, of course, one of its most enjoyable perks.)\n\nOf course, Trump\u2019s opponents have a different idea of how power should be used. The defining ideological conflict of the Trump era isn\u2019t between conservatives and liberals. It\u2019s between those who embrace Trump\u2019s gleefully anarchic, ends-justify-the-means bashing of \u201cthe establishment\u201d and those who would protest, to quote another Larry David creation, that \u201cwe\u2019re living in a society.\u201d By reversing the polarity of a simple morality play like \u201cStar Wars,\u201d the MAGA camp isn\u2019t missing the point at all. On the contrary, they\u2019re killing two birds with one stone: expressing their philosophy with a wink and a nod while getting in some good, old-fashioned trolling.\n\nAnd as Trump\u2019s attention shifted over the past decade from his business and entertainment empire to a nationwide ideological project, his pet cultural signifiers have scaled up to match. \u201cStar Wars,\u201d or the Marvel Cinematic Universe, or \u201cRocky,\u201d are useful first and foremost in their ubiquity; to invoke them is to amplify what would otherwise be ho-hum partisan mudslinging.\n\nAlmost uniformly, this is to the chagrin of the creators of those stories invoked with a smirk by Parscale and company. In December, when the Trump campaign sent the Thanos tweet, the character\u2019s creator (and Marvel Comics legend) Jim Starlin compared the experience to \u201cbeing violated.\u201d George Lucas himself, a dyed-in-the-wool 1960s radical who envisioned the original \u201cStar Wars\u201d as a pro-Viet Cong parable, consulted on an anti-Trump ad from former Senator Bill Bradley\u2019s Super PAC before the 2016 election.\n\nBut it\u2019s hard to imagine the average Trump supporter \u2014 and certainly not the man himself \u2014 caring about such a thing. Through the MAGA lens, the creative impulse behind those characters isn\u2019t something to be respected piously, or parsed earnestly for sociopolitical relevance. In fact, Trumpworld\u2019s relationship with something like \u201cStar Wars\u201d might ultimately be slightly more reasonable than that of your humble author: as nothing more than a trivial entertainment that might occasionally serve as a shared reference point or shallow reflecting pool.\n\nRecall Trump\u2019s advice to Charles Foster Kane, the protagonist of \u201cCitizen Kane,\u201d a favorite film of his. When the documentarian Errol Morris asked the future president in 2002 if he would give any advice to the fictional Kane, a man torn apart by hubris and his obsession over his own work and legacy, Trump\u2019s response was simple: \u201cGet yourself a different woman.\u201d Trump couldn\u2019t have been less interested in psychoanalyzing Kane as a proxy for Orson Welles, or a metaphor for unchecked power and ambition. Kane merely served as a lens through which Trump could implicitly present himself as the savvier, ideal version of the fictional tycoon. (After all, he\u2019s followed his own prescription for Kane twice now.)\n\nThe best example of the Trumpian ethos in pop culture, and how the president\u2019s fans bear it with pride, is one that mostly passed without remark. As the Democratic-controlled House prepared for its impeachment inquiry last September, Parscale warned that he would \u201claugh this much when everyone figures out how much @realDonaldTrump played @SpeakerPelosi,\u201d followed by a frequently used GIF of Leonardo DiCaprio\u2019s exaggerated laughter as the penny-stock scoundrel and convicted fraudster Jordan Belfort in 2013\u2019s \u201cThe Wolf of Wall Street.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m going to laugh this much when everyone figures out how much @realDonaldTrump played @SpeakerPelosi. pic.twitter.com/WbsNv1Y8R9 \u2014 Brad Parscale (@parscale) September 29, 2019\n\nThe GIF is taken from the film\u2019s climactic scene, in which Belfort\u2019s foil, a mostly glum, by-the-book FBI agent played by \u201cFriday Night Lights\u201d star Kyle Chandler, boards Belfort\u2019s palatial yacht to question him as part of a securities fraud investigation. Chandler\u2019s agent gets Belfort cold on tape attempting a bribe. The laugh that Parscale appropriated comes right after Belfort is threatened with the seizure of his treasured yacht, and immediately before he launches into a panicked, self-aggrandizing tirade \u2014 \u201cGood luck on that subway ride home to your miserable, ugly fucking wives\u2026 you guys want to take some lobsters for your ride home? Fucking miserable pricks, I know you can\u2019t afford them!\u201d He finishes up by tossing $100 bills, or \u201cfun coupons,\u201d at Chandler and his partner as they walk away, defiant in the self-justifying nature of Belfort\u2019s excess.\n\nThe philosophy on display in Parscale\u2019s \u201cWolf of Wall Street\u201d tweet is very simple, and it\u2019s the same one that\u2019s revealed in the Trump team\u2019s gleeful, impish identification with far more fantastical villains like Darth Vader. Victory is defined by the extent to which one is enjoying the spoils. Following the rules is for suckers and schoolmarms.\n\nBelfort, on the other hand, is a real person who ultimately served real prison time for securities fraud and money laundering (and is now, as Martin Scorcese\u2019s film points out in its mordant conclusion, a successful motivational speaker). He\u2019s also a Trump supporter.\n\nIf Trump\u2019s camp is trolling the world with its Machiavellian embrace of fictional villainy, it might reflect even another level of self-awareness \u2014 a hard-won acknowledgment that occasionally, despite everything, the rule-followers eke out a win.", "link": "https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/05/16/trump-death-star-pop-culture-mutiny-bounty-curb-enthusiasm-260471", "published": "2020-05-16T00:00:00", "author": []}, {"title": "Reopening reality check: Georgia's jobs aren\u2019t flooding back", "text": "There are many reasons Georgia\u2019s jobless numbers are still going up, economists say, including that the state, like most of the country, is still whittling through a backlog of applications.

But the data still underscores how lifting stay-at-home restrictions alone will do little to bring jobs and spending back unless consumer confidence improves, bringing demand with it.\n\n\u201cThink of a restaurant: They\u2019re not going to be able to bring back their entire staff because they\u2019re just not going to have the clientele,\u201d said Laura Wheeler, associate director of the Center for State and Local Finance at Georgia State University. \u201cThat\u2019s going to hinder the return of the workforce, because while we\u2019re going to open up, we\u2019re not going to open up to the full capacity that we were at before.\u201d\n\nAnd in Georgia, public polling indicates that confidence has yet to return. Nearly two-thirds of Georgia residents in a recent Washington Post-Ipsos poll said they felt their state was lifting restrictions too quickly, and only 39 percent said they approved of Kemp\u2019s handling of the outbreak.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been chasing a bit of a false narrative that the economic hit is about the restrictions and not the disease itself,\u201d said Julia Coronado, president and founder of Macropolicy Perspectives, an economic research consulting firm. \u201cThe economic story really isn\u2019t about lockdowns, and we\u2019re going to make mistakes by pursuing that narrative. It really is about the disease, and how fearful people are about getting sick, and how businesses are going to operate in a world where this virus is with us.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, the Trump administration is pushing to get governors to reopen their doors in the hopes that doing so will help revive the U.S. economy.\n\nTrump has amplified calls to \u201cliberate\u201d states and criticized governors he feels are moving too cautiously, often accusing Democratic leaders of playing politics. \u201cYou have areas of Pennsylvania that are barely affected, and they want to keep them closed,\u201d he said during a visit to the state last week, a hit to Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf. \u201cCan't do that.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, The White House is also closely watching state-level claims data and expects reopening to have a major effect, Kevin Hassett, a senior economic adviser to the president, said late last week. \u201cMy fear is that the places that stay closed could have sort of skyrocketing claims,\u201d Hassett told reporters at the White House, adding: \u201cThe places that are turning on could actually see claims go way back down towards normal.\u201d\n\nBut many economists dispute the idea that lifting restrictions will by itself mean a major boost to the labor market, in part because of evidence that layoffs accelerated in March separate from governors\u2019 shutdown restrictions. A recent analysis by four University of California-Berkeley researchers found that the direct effect of stay-at-home orders accounted for only one-quarter of the jobless claims at the start of the crisis \u2014 suggesting that a majority of jobs that have been erased would have been lost even without statewide shutdowns.\n\nA drop-off in consumer demand, disruptions to global supply chains and self-imposed social distancing measures all exacerbated the job losses and will likely continue to hinder the economic recovery after shutdown restrictions are removed.\n\nPOLITICO compared nine weeks of non-seasonally-adjusted initial jobless claims to Georgia\u2019s non-adjusted residential employment from February to determine the state\u2019s jobless claims rate of 40.3 percent, which is currently the highest in the country.\n\nMorning Shift Get the latest on employment and immigration, every weekday morning \u2014 in your inbox.

The state did change its criteria early on to require employers to file unemployment claims on behalf of their employees in many situations, a move that supporters say simplifies the process and allows for quicker payouts. The state also now allows workers to earn as much as $300 each week without having their unemployment eligibility affected.\n\nOthers speculated that Georgia might employ more workers in industries like hospitality and healthcare that have been deeply affected, or that many residents are employed by small businesses that have struggled to survive during the pandemic.\n\nBut no matter the reasons, experts say the data offers an early indication of why millions of jobs across the country that were erased in mere weeks could take years to return.\n\n\u201cReopening is certainly not a lights-on, lights-off situation,\u201d said Andrew Stettner, a senior fellow at the Century Foundation, a progressive think tank. \u201cThese are companies that have seen a shock in their demand, and at a certain point, they can\u2019t keep their workers on.\u201d", "link": "https://www.politico.com/news/2020/05/21/georgia-reopening-coronavirus-jobs-273070", "published": "2020-05-21T00:00:00", "author": []}, {"title": "With social distance safety warnings, Birx tempers Trump's reopening message", "text": "Trump called an unexpected press conference to announce he was ordering churches, mosques and synagogues open this weekend \u2014 and promptly left without taking questions.

What I\u2019m worried about is making sure we win the fight against coronavirus.\u201d\n\nThough an extension is still possible, Lengyel told state National Guard leaders on a Thursday night call that they need to start preparing to transition to a state-funded mission. State leaders say this would mean pulling troops off the front lines of the pandemic response, both because states can't afford to keep them all mobilized without federal support and because Guard members need to be given two weeks to self-quarantine plus time to use the paid leave they earned on this mission.\n\n\u201cWe were told to start planning to pull our troops off of their missions effective June 24,\u201d said Major Gen. Matt Quinn, the adjutant general of Montana and the president of the Adjutants General Association of the United States. \u201cAnd if the soldiers and airmen were in close contact with someone who had Covid-19, we need to pull them off 14 days early for the quarantine period.\u201d\n\nOfficials from two different states also told POLITICO that Lengyel on that call encouraged state leaders to emphasize in their requests for longer federal deployment that the Guards' work is vital to getting the economy back on track. They interpreted this comment to mean an economic argument would be more convincing to Trump.\n\nStates seem to have taken the advice to heart. \"Current National Guard response missions are absolutely critical to the state\u2019s efforts to sustain a safe and responsible opening of our economy,\" Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, a Democrat, wrote the president, asking for an extension until July 31.\n\nThe push from military officials builds on mounting pressure from Capitol Hill. After POLITICO reported that the administration was planning a \u201chard stop\u201d to the federal deployment on June 24 \u2014 just one day before thousands of Guard members would qualify for early retirement and education benefits \u2014 Republican and Democratic members of Congress introduced a wave of bills and oversight actions aimed at extending the deployment and securing Guard members' federal benefits.\n\n\"Having a hard stop, just to shortchange National Guard members, does not help us combat the virus and could lead to gaps in the support network the Administration already took too long build,\" said Rep. Bennie Thompson, (D-Miss.) chair of the House Homeland Security Committee. \"We all know the pandemic will continue to affect states for months to come.\"\n\nRep. Max Rose (D-N.Y.), a combat veteran and National Guard captain leading some of the congressional efforts said he hopes Congress doesn't have to do a legislative fix \"since the all the White House has to do is reverse this idiotic, cold decision.\"\n\nState officials warn that pulling the troops off the pandemic response next month would disrupt key public health missions that have just begun. In Delaware, for example, 100 National Guard members just this week began supporting the contact tracing operation, which tracks the spread of the virus as the state prepares to reopen. In Wisconsin, Guard members are running an alternate care facility in Milwaukee and leading 25 field testing teams around the state, and lawmakers warned in a letter to the White House on Thursday that the loss of federal funding \"could contribute to a possible second wave of infection.\u201d\n\n\u201cMany states have said it is going to be hard for us to transition\u201d to the state-funded mission if the federal deployment adds after just 89 days, Lengyel told POLITICO. In Texas, he said, officials want to add 2,000 members of the Guard in nursing homes to disinfect facilities, an effort that will likely take until after June 24 to complete.\n\nIn Montana, National Guard members recently begun running drive-through testing sites on the state\u2019s Native American reservations focused on rooting out asymptomatic infections.\n\n\u201cWe're just starting those missions and just because of some arbitrary date, possibly tied to benefits, we\u2019re going to have to pull the troops off,\u201d Quinn lamented. \u201cI just don\u2019t know where we\u2019re going to find the manpower to continue to do the testing that\u2019s recommended by the White House and CDC of our most vulnerable citizens.\u201d", "link": "https://www.politico.com/news/2020/05/22/national-guard-deployments-mark-esper-274628", "published": "2020-05-22T00:00:00", "author": []}, {"title": "No evidence hydroxychloroquine treats coronavirus, new study shows", "text": "About 15,000 patients received the chloroquine drugs or a combination with the antibiotics azithromycin or clarithromycin, while the remaining 81,000 did not.

Multiple,\u201d Biden said of his search process for a vice presidential nominee.\n\nIt was then that an aide to the Biden campaign could be heard interjecting into the conversation, attempting to cut short the interview. \u201cThank you so much. That\u2019s really our time. I apologize,\u201d the staffer said.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t do that to black media!\u201d Charlamagne retorted.\n\n\u201cI do that to white media and black media because my wife has to go on at 6 o\u2019clock,\u201d Biden shot back, apparently referring to a subsequent media appearance by Jill Biden.

I\u2019m in trouble.\u201d\n\n\u201cListen, you\u2019ve got to come see us when you come to New York, VP Biden,\u201d Charlamagne said. \u201cIt\u2019s a long way until November. We\u2019ve got more questions.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got more questions?\u201d Biden replied. \u201cWell, I tell you what, if you have a problem figuring out whether you\u2019re for me or Trump, then you ain\u2019t black.\u201d\n\nCharlamagne explained that \u201cit don\u2019t have nothing to do with Trump, it has to do with the fact [that] I want something for my community.\u201d But Biden remained adamant in promoting what he described as a career of public service devoted to advancing civil rights.\n\n\u201cTake a look at my record, man! I extended the Voting Rights [Act] 25 years. I have a record that is second-to-none,\u201d he said. \u201cThe NAACP\u2019s endorsed me every time I\u2019ve run. I mean, come on. Take a look at the record.\u201d\n\nProminent Republicans immediately seized upon Biden\u2019s gaffe, including the party\u2019s only black senator, Tim Scott of South Carolina, who called the former vice president\u2019s statements \u201cthe most arrogant, condescending comment I\u2019ve heard in a very long time.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you think about the numbers, 1.3 million African Americans voted for Trump. He\u2019s saying [to] the 1.3 million African Americans that you\u2019re not black,\u201d Scott told Fox Business. \u201cWho in the heck does he think he is?\u201d\n\nLindsey Graham, Scott\u2019s fellow South Carolina senator, tweeted that Biden\u2019s comments \u201cwere truly offensive, but a rare and honest insight into liberals\u2019 thinking. Liberals believe you really can\u2019t be black, Latino, female, or intelligent unless you support their liberal agenda.\u201d\n\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s reelection campaign also weighed in on the controversy, posting a video of Biden\u2019s exchange with Charlamagne to its official Twitter account along with the accompanying message: \u201cSorry to inform all the Black Trump Supporters that #YouAintBlack in @JoeBiden\u2019s book.\u201d\n\nTrump has also made sweeping generalizations about racial and religious groups in recent years. Apart from his derogatory descriptions of undocumented immigrants, he attempted to court black voters in 2016 by asking them \u201cwhat the hell do you have to lose?\u201d and last August accused Jewish Americans of \u201cgreat disloyalty\u201d if they vote for Democrats.\n\nSome Democratic political consultants balked at Biden\u2019s remarks, as well. \u201cThis is so embarrassing and hurtful I don\u2019t even know where to begin,\u201d tweeted Rodericka Applewhaite, a former staffer on Pete Buttigieg\u2019s presidential campaign.\n\nBriahna Joy Gray, a former spokeswoman for Bernie Sanders presidential campaign and a frequent Biden critic, tweeted that the former vice president had \u201cpicked up on establishment media talking points.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is the natural consequence of the reductive view of race & politics being pushed by the \u2018identity is destiny\u2019 crowd,\u201d she wrote. \u201cCharming.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile Biden\u2019s campaign sought to manage the fallout online, with his senior adviser Symone Sanders insisting that the \u201ccomments made at the end of the Breakfast Club interview were in jest.\u201d\n\nStill, Sanders tweeted, \u201clet\u2019s be clear about what the VP was saying: he was making the distinction that he would put his record with the African American community up against Trump\u2019s any day. Period.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Breakfast Club\u201d produced similarly unvarnished moments with other White House contenders during the Democratic presidential primary, as the New York-based, nationally syndicated hip-hop morning show developed into a popular pit stop where candidates could opine on the state of the race and outline their agendas for African Americans.\n\nLike many other media outlets eschewed by the Biden campaign throughout the primary contest, the former vice president did not appear on the program until after vanquishing his rivals for the party\u2019s nomination.\n\nOn Thursday, Biden faced an intent line of questioning from Charlamagne, who pressed him on his reluctance to concede that the 1994 crime bill \u201cwas damaging to the black community.\u201d\n\nAs a senator from Delaware, Biden helped author and shepherd the far-reaching legislation through Congress. The crime bill has long been accused of disproportionately targeting marginalized communities and people of color.\n\nAlthough the crime bill dogged Biden\u2019s presidential candidacy in the early stages of the 2020 primary, he refused Thursday to apologize for it and even argued that Hillary Clinton, the previous Democratic presidential nominee, should not have expressed regret for her advocacy of the measure in 2016.\n\n\u201cShe was wrong. What happened was, it wasn\u2019t the crime bill. It was the drug legislation. It was the institution of mandatory minimums,\u201d Biden said, pointing to other factors he claimed had produced levels of mass incarceration in the United States.\n\nBiden also sought to respond to concerns among African Americans that Democratic politicians take their votes for granted by emphatically defending his ties to the black community, which was largely credited for contributing to his comeback win in the primary earlier this year.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re the folks [who], as they say it my way, \u2018Brung me to the dance.\u2019 That\u2019s how I get elected every single time,\u201d he said, imploring Charlamagne: \u201cCome on man, give me a little break here.

He's made clear that the electoral politics of his pick matter less than choosing someone who can be a governing partner and step into the top job without worry.\n\nBut the vocal contingent of African American and Latino detractors \u2014 many of whom said they would prefer that Biden select a black woman as a running mate \u2014 is unique to Klobuchar; Elizabeth Warren, another top contender for VP, doesn\u2019t elicit similar antagonism from communities of color.\n\n\"It comes from her performance in the primary \u2014 her weakness in being able to motivate them,\" said Adrianne Shropshire, executive director of BlackPAC, who supports several potential vice presidential selections. \u201cThe engagement and the enthusiasm of black voters is going to be a difference-maker in this election, and the concerns about her in this role stem from the degree to which she resonated or not with those core constituencies.\u201d\n\nEarlier this week, Biden confirmed that \"multiple black women [are] being considered\" for vice president. Those often named include Sen. Kamala Harris, former Georgia gubernatorial nominee Stacey Abrams and Florida Rep. Val Demings. Besides Klobuchar, other Midwestern options, like Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, have been mentioned.\n\nBut for many of these operatives, Klobuchar symbolizes a strategic division within the Democratic Party: whether to focus on winning back white, Midwestern voters who flipped to Donald Trump in 2016, or on activating voters of color who were not excited to vote. She \u201crepresents that tension,\u201d said the Rev. Al Sharpton, who added he\u2019s told Biden that he would prefer a black woman on the ticket, but noted he\u2019s \u201cnot anti-Amy.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is not her fault, but she is in the middle of an ongoing battle from the last few presidential races,\u201d Sharpton continued, adding he would be \u201cconcerned\u201d that selecting Klobuchar would not help energize black and brown voters.\n\nIn a Washington Post op-ed this month urging Biden to select a woman of color as running mate, seven black strategists and activists called out Klobuchar, warning she would \u201conly alienate black voters.\u201d\n\n\"Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee, does not need help winning white, working-class voters \u2014 he serves that function himself,\" they wrote. Referring to her record as a chief prosecutor in Minneapolis-based Hennepin County, they added, \"A choice such as Sen. Amy Klobuchar (Minn.), who failed to prosecute controversial police killings and is responsible for the imprisonment of Myon Burrell, will only alienate black voters.\"\n\n\u201cIf it was important enough to raise in an op-ed, it speaks to how serious we are,\u201d LaTosha Brown, a co-founder of Black Voters Matter and the lead author of the op-ed, said in an interview. \u201cHer campaign appeal was about bringing in working-class, white people from the Midwest, and perhaps that\u2019s true, but that\u2019s a particular strategy that doesn\u2019t align with what it\u2019s going to take to win. You need to excite the base.\u201d\n\nAngela Rye, a Democratic strategist and the former executive director of the Congressional Black Caucus, who also signed the op-ed, called Klobuchar a \u201cnonstarter.\u201d\n\nKlobuchar's boosters counter that opposition to President Donald Trump will bring out the Democratic base no matter what, and that the key Rust Belt states Democrats have to win play to Klobuchar's strengths.\n\n\"I think she could help put the upper Midwest in play, and that's an invaluable asset,\" said Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, who backed Bernie Sanders during the presidential primary. He also noted that \"there are a lot of black people\" in the Midwest, in cities like Detroit and Milwaukee, who will be key for Democrats\u2019 winning back those states.\n\n\"I think the base is going to be excited enough because, before, Trump was an idea, now Trump is the reality,\" Ellison continued.\n\nKlobuchar has been working to improve her relationships with minority activists and politicians since she dropped out of the presidential race. She endorsed a slate of racially and regionally diverse candidates in down-ballot races. She\u2019s worked with Stacey Abrams, another VP contender, to promote a vote-by-mail bill that was endorsed by Voto Latino and the Rev. Jesse Jackson earlier this month. She also wrote a bill to expand broadband access to students at historically black colleges and Hispanic-serving institutions. And she participated in a virtual town hall hosted by the NAACP on how the coronavirus is disproportionately hurting black and brown people.\n\nDuring the presidential primary, Leah Daughtry, CEO of the Democratic national convention committees in 2008 and 2016, hosted Klobuchar with a group of influential black female leaders, \u201chalf she knew, half she didn\u2019t,\u201d and \u201cpeople walked away with a favorable impression.\u201d\n\nBut, Daughtry noted, \u201cbuilding relationships in every area of our lives takes time, including in politics,\u201d and \u201cit isn\u2019t something you can do in a matter of weeks.\u201d\n\nThe primary results illustrate Klobuchar's failure among voters of color.\n\nIn South Carolina, she won 1 percent of black voters, even though they make up a majority of Democratic primary voters in the state. It was the lowest total for any of the presidential candidates on the ballot.\n\nIn Nevada, Klobuchar received 4 percent support of the Latino vote, the lowest share of any presidential candidate other than Rep. Tulsi Gabbard. Nationally, Klobuchar regularly polled in the low single digits among voters of color.\n\n\u201cCould she have done more? Absolutely,\u201d said Antjuan Seawright, a South Carolina-based Democratic consultant. \u201cBut she knew where her bread was buttered, and that started in Iowa. She was taking the race as it comes.\u201d\n\nSeawright noted that Biden\u2019s own strength in the black community \u2014 as evidenced by his resounding victory in South Carolina, which revived his flailing campaign \u2014 \u201cgives room for the potential for Amy Klobuchar\u201d as vice president.\n\n2020 Election Results Who\u2019s winning 2020?

On Friday, he apologized on a conference call with black leaders for comments he made to \"The Breakfast Club\" radio host: \"If you have a problem figuring out whether you're for me or Trump, then you ain't black.\"\n\nKlobuchar\u2019s prosecutorial record as Hennepin County attorney is another sore spot, particularly her handling of a case involving Burrell, a black teenager. An investigation by The Associated Press found numerous flaws in the case, and civil rights leaders in Minnesota called for her to suspend her presidential campaign.\n\nKlobuchar called for an independent investigation after her campaign ended, a move applauded by the Minnesota NAACP.\n\nIf Biden picked Klobuchar as his vice president, \u201cit would add to [his] workload\u201d for the general election, said Daughtry, who signed onto another letter sent to Biden, urging the selection of a black woman as vice presidential nominee.\n\n\u201cThere are enough people who either A, don\u2019t know her, or B, have a negative view of her that it becomes another thing the campaign has to do \u2014 introduce her and convince communities of color that she\u2019s OK,\u201d Daughtry said. \u201cThat\u2019s not impossible, but there\u2019s already a lot of work to do in a presidential race.\u201d", "link": "https://www.politico.com/news/2020/05/23/black-activists-joe-biden-amy-klobuchar-vice-president-275326", "published": "2020-05-23T00:00:00", "author": ["Quint Forgey", "Myah Ward", "David Siders", "Laura Barr\u00f3n-L\u00f3pez"]}, {"title": "Plagued by stock trades, Loeffler vows she won't drop out", "text": "Loeffler\u2019s five months as a senator have not been easy. She\u2019s facing attacks from the left and right for selling millions of dollars in stocks after receiving a private briefing on the coronavirus pandemic. What\u2019s more, she\u2019s fighting off a serious challenge from Rep. Doug Collins (R-Ga.) \u2014 a strong ally of President Donald Trump \u2014 who is ahead in most recent public polling.\n\nSince news of her stock trades broke, Loeffler has tried to erase the cloud hanging over her. She insists her financial transactions were done through a third-party adviser, vowed to divest from her individual stocks and recused herself from a Senate agriculture subcommittee. She\u2019s also donated $1 million to provide food for hungry Georgians during the economic crisis.\n\nBut Loeffler\u2019s portfolio threatens to overshadow everything else. And Collins knows it.\n\n\u201cInstead of working for the people of Georgia for the past five months in D.C., she seems to have been working for herself,\u201d he said in an interview Thursday. \u201cBecause all she\u2019s been able to do is have to explain her stock scandal and left her doing nothing else more than that.\u201d\n\nJust last week, Loeffler revealed that she handed over documents to the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Justice Department and the Senate Ethics Committee, one day after the FBI seized the phone of another senator facing his own stock trades problem, Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.).\n\nIn the interview, Loeffler declined to answer whether the FBI has contacted her or whether she\u2019s requested an Ethics Committee investigation into her own finances, as Burr did. The Georgia Republican pointed to her previous statements saying she turned over documents and would \"absolutely\" cooperate with the SEC or Ethics Committee.\n\n\u201cThis is the liberal media attacking someone who supports free enterprise,\u201d she said. \u201cI'm not going to be deterred by it.\u201d\n\nCollins, who has done work as a defense attorney, isn\u2019t buying it: \u201cWhen somebody won\u2019t say they\u2019re under investigation, the probable answer is they\u2019re under investigation.\u201d\n\nAnd Loeffler\u2019s colleagues acknowledge the issue isn\u2019t going away.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s going to have to answer it,\u201d said Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) \u201cAnd I mean she\u2019s been trying to. It\u2019s an issue, there\u2019s no question.\u201d\n\nThe intraparty warfare over the seat could cede ground to Democrats in Georgia, with both Loeffler and her colleague, Sen. David Perdue (R-Ga.), up in November and the Senate majority up for grabs. Perdue declined to comment on the status of the Loeffler-Collins race and didn\u2019t indicate whether he\u2019d campaign with Loeffler, citing a campaigning hiatus because of coronavirus.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not commenting on that race,\u201d said Perdue, adding that the Republican candidates were better than the Democrats in the race.\n\nGeorgia Gov. Brian Kemp appointed Loeffler to the seat in December to replace Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.), who retired for health reasons. The state\u2019s November special election is a nonpartisan contest with close to two dozen Republican and Democratic candidates. If no candidate receives a majority, it will go to a January 2021 runoff.\n\n\"Not only am I not dropping out, but I'm gonna win.\" Sen. Kelly Loeffler\n\nLoeffler has indicated she's ready to go on the offensive, describing Collins in the interview as a \"do-nothing, career politician who has tax and spend as a strategy.\" Collins retorted: \"It's amazing she can read a cue card from her consultants.\"\n\nLoeffler entered the Senate in the run-up to Trump\u2019s impeachment trial, providing an unprecedented challenge for a junior senator trying to establish herself. She moves through the Capitol quietly and calmly, generally refusing to engage with reporters. In the interview, she was disciplined and talked herself up as a political outsider just like Trump.\n\nThough Collins can boast that he was a prominent opponent of Trump\u2019s impeachment in the House, Loeffler can say she voted to acquit the president. In the interview, she also touted securing coronavirus relief for Georgians through the CARES Act and introducing proposals to help the economy recover amid the pandemic. She said her tenure in Washington has been about what she expected. Except for one thing.\n\n\u201cI knew I'd be attacked for my success, and I knew it would come from the left,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat's been surprising is it\u2019s come from the right, as well. And I think that's shameful.\u201d\n\nDespite her struggles in the polls, Loeffler has the backing of many of her Senate GOP colleagues as well as the National Republican Senatorial Committee. The campaign committee has attacked Collins for being selfish and putting Perdue's seat at risk by running \u2014 even dubbing him a \"convenient conservative.\" But Loeffler, a former chief executive of a financial services company, is a wealthy self-funder, so it's unclear what level of financial commitment the GOP will make for her.\n\n\u201cWe think she\u2019s a very strong candidate,\u201d said Senate Majority Whip John Thune of South Dakota. Sen. Joni Ernst of Iowa, a member of GOP leadership who is up for reelection, has spoken personally with Loeffler about her stock trades and said her defense was compelling. She said Loeffler was a strong conservative woman.\n\nStill, some members of the caucus are not picking sides. Sen. Kevin Cramer of North Dakota, who served with Collins in the House, said he disagrees with the NRSC\u2019s aggressive attacks on his former colleague.\n\n\u201cHe has every right to do it, and he\u2019s not just a gadfly, obviously, he's a serious member of Congress,\u201d Cramer said.\n\nAnd Sen. Mike Braun of Indiana said Loeffler is a \u201cgreat candidate\u201d but he will let her battle with Collins play out rather than making any endorsements: \u201cI\u2019m one that loves transparency and competition.\u201d\n\nPrivately, some Republican senators and aides have more dour assessments. They understand the NRSC needs to back incumbents to guard against primary challenges, which have dogged Republicans in the past, but several said she\u2019s in a dangerous situation and might need to drop out of the race. No sitting GOP senator has publicly said, however, that she should quit.\n\nSome recently appointed senators have gone poorly for each party. In Alabama, then-Sen. Luther Strange (R-Ala.) blew his primary after the GOP spent millions propping him up and Democrats captured the seat in 2017. And Sen. John Walsh (D-Mont.) dropped out of his campaign amid allegations of plagiarism in 2014, ultimately resulting in a GOP pick-up.\n\nMorning Score Your guide to the permanent campaign \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox.

But some members acknowledge that the stock issue could be a problem for the party.\n\n\u201cThe polling is not great,\u201d said one GOP senator.\n\nA recent poll conducted for the GOP firm Cygnal on behalf of state House Republicans and Speaker David Ralston has Collins leading the race at 29 percent, with Loeffler well behind at 11 percent. Ralston is a close ally of Collins. Another poll conducted by the Democratic pollster Civiqs for the liberal website Daily Kos had Collins leading the pack at 34 percent and Loeffler polling at 12 percent.\n\nBut one poll conducted by Public Opinion Strategies and commissioned by a group that supports Kemp depicted a much closer race, with 19 percent of voters backing Collins and 18 percent backing Loeffler. Collins said that poll used \u201cnonexistent\u201d information and was not transparent, but Loeffler is leaning strongly on it.\n\n\u201cI'm in a statistical tie for first, but that is going to be decided in November by the people of Georgia,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd if we believed polls, then Hillary Clinton would be president and Stacey Abrams would be the governor of Georgia.\u201d\n\nOne thing that could upend the race: a Trump endorsement.\n\nBoth Collins and Loeffler have embraced the president. And Loeffler\u2019s husband, Jeffrey Sprecher, chairman of the New York Stock Exchange, donated $1 million to the pro-Trump super PAC America First Action in April. Loeffler has also voted with Trump 100 percent of the time, according to FiveThirtyEight, and has offered nothing but praise for the president.\n\n\u201cI was inspired by President Trump as someone in the private sector,\u201d she said. \u201cThat gave me the confidence to put my hand up and say I want to serve in office, because I believe I can make a difference.\u201d\n\nBut Collins won high marks on the right during the House impeachment proceedings as a fierce defender the president, and Trump pushed Kemp to choose Collins for the slot. Collins said Trump\u2019s reluctance to back Loeffler \u201csays a great deal about my relationship with the president.\u201d", "link": "https://www.politico.com/news/2020/05/22/loeffler-wont-drop-out-georgia-stock-trades-273966", "published": "2020-05-22T00:00:00", "author": ["Sen.

An array of recent polls have shown Trump losing to Joe Biden in the state, which Democrats have not won in a presidential election since 1996. Democrats have signaled they intend to make an aggressive play in Arizona.\n\nThe Senate race is a particular trouble spot. As Senate Republicans try to protect their majority, McSally has emerged as one of the party\u2019s most vulnerable incumbents. One survey released this week showed McSally trailing Kelly by 13 points.\n\nMcSally is also heading into the final six months of the campaign at a substantial fundraising disadvantage. Through the end of March, Kelly had outraised McSally $31 million to $18 million. Kelly, who is the husband of ex-Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, is the most well-funded Senate candidate in the country.\n\nThe race is center to Democratic hopes of winning control of the Senate. Along with Colorado, Democrats see Arizona as their best opportunity to flip a GOP-held seat.\n\nRepublicans have made protecting McSally, a former congresswoman and ex-Air Force fighter pilot, a top priority. The National Republican Senatorial Committee has booked $5.7 million in TV advertising in the state. Defend Arizona, a super PAC aligned with the national party, is expected to spend $9.2 million.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a fact that Arizona is a battleground state for both the presidential and U.S. Senate campaigns,\u201d said McSally campaign manager Dylan Lefler. \"We are confident that the Republican Party is fully invested in keeping Arizona red in November because control of the White House and the Senate depends on it.\"\n\nPOLITICO NEWSLETTERS Playbook PM Sign up for our must-read newsletter on what\u2019s driving the afternoon in Washington.

They note the state has grown more liberal in recent years, with four statewide offices flipping to Democrats in 2018. That year, McSally lost to Democrat Kyrsten Sinema. She was later appointed to the seat of the late John McCain.\n\nTrump advisers project confidence about the president\u2019s prospects in the battleground state. Advisers noted during Thursday\u2019s meeting that while McSally lost in 2018, Republican Gov. Doug Ducey won reelection.\n\nBut other Republicans are concerned. Biden, they say, will be a tougher opponent than Hillary Clinton was in 2016. They also worry that Trump's troubles in suburban areas could prove costly.\n\n\"Trump is his own worst enemy with swing constituencies,\" said Chuck Couglin, who served as a top adviser to former Republican Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer. \"His best shot with those voters is to make his opponent less attractive than he is. He will have a harder time doing that with Biden. He will try though.\"\n\nArizona is one of two traditionally conservative states Democrats are trying to put in play. They are also planning to compete in Georgia, which Democrats haven't won in a presidential election since 1992. Trump won the state by 5 percentage points in 2016, though recent surveys have shown a tight race.\n\nDemocrats say competing in red states will open up multiple avenues for Biden to reach the 270 electoral vote threshold. The party has been mostly focused on three Rust Belt states \u2014 Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania \u2014 that Trump won by narrow margins in 2016.\n\nA survey released earlier this month showed Biden leading Arizona by 7 percentage points, though Trump advisers insist his numbers in the state are more favorable.\n\n", "link": "https://www.politico.com/news/2020/05/21/trump-senate-mcsally-arizona-273555", "published": "2020-05-21T00:00:00", "author": []}, {"title": "Trump declares houses of worship \u2018essential,\u2019 pressuring governors to let them reopen", "text": "Trump emphasized he was instructing governors to allow places of worship to resume operations \u201cright now,\u201d and warned that \u201cif there\u2019s any question, they\u2019re going to have to call me \u2014 but they are not going to be successful in that call.\u201d\n\nIt is unclear whether the president is legally empowered to compel the nation\u2019s governors to take such an action. If the White House moves to enforce his order in defiance of opposition by local officials, Trump could force a constitutional clash over one of the fundamental freedoms enshrined in the First Amendment.\n\nChallenged on Trump\u2019s authority to unilaterally reopen places of worship, White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said at the briefing Friday the administration would \u201cleave it to faith communities to reopen,\u201d and pointed to \u201cdetailed guidance\u201d from the federal government \u201cabout the way you can clean your facility [and] promote social distancing.\u201d\n\nBut soon after his remarks at the White House, the president was confronted with resistance from state and local executives. Rhode Island Gov. Gina Raimondo said she would not alter her state\u2019s plans to reopen places of worship on May 30, and Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot also announced her city would ignore Trump\u2019s demand.\n\n\u201cBy no means can the president order any locality, any state to do something that he doesn\u2019t have the power to do,\u201d Lightfoot said. \u201cAnd he can\u2019t do that here.\u201d\n\nThe CDC\u2019s guidelines, released after weeks of internal debate and scrutiny over leaked drafts, offered detailed measures for how places of worship can start to safely reopen, while advising them to consult with state and local authorities. In contrast with the earlier leaked guidelines, the agency didn\u2019t recommend a phased reopening and instead laid out recommendations for how faith-based communities can promote safety, hygiene and social distancing.\n\nFor instance, the agency suggested groups consider suspending or decreasing how often choirs are used, as well as congregant singing and chanting during a service \u201cif appropriate within the faith tradition.\u201d It also recommended temporary limits on sharing religious objects, like books or cups, and to instead photocopy or email prayers to attendees.\n\nPublic health experts have expressed concern about the risks related to reopening places of worship. At least two churches in Georgia and Texas that had recently reopened shut down again this week after members tested positive for the virus, and a report from the CDC earlier this week documented how an early March outbreak in a rural Arkansas church spread from a pastor and his wife to about three dozen parishioners, killing three.\n\nStill, Trump insisted Friday that Americans are nevertheless \u201cdemanding to go to church and synagogue or to their mosque,\u201d and he predicted \u201cthe ministers, pastors, rabbis, imams and other faith leaders will make sure that their congregations are safe\u201d when they gather.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t want anything bad to happen to them or to anybody else,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThe governors need to do the right thing and allow these very important, essential places of faith to open right now, for this weekend. If they don\u2019t do it, I will override the governors. In America, we need more prayer, not less.\u201d\n\nDeborah Birx, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, stressed the importance of practicing mitigation measures as places of worship reopen, and said community faith leaders should be in touch with their local health departments.\n\n\u201cI think what we are trying to say with the CDC guidance is there is a way for us to work together to have social distancing and safety for people, so that we decrease the amount of exposure that anyone would have to asymptomatic [people],\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I see it that way because I know all of you and all of Americans, if they didn\u2019t feel well, they wouldn\u2019t go to church that day.\u201d", "link": "https://www.politico.com/news/2020/05/22/trump-churches-essential-coronavirus-274763", "published": "2020-05-22T00:00:00", "author": []}, {"title": "Senior officials advised against Trump emergency arms sales to Saudis", "text": "But during meetings last spring of the National Security Council at several levels, high-level career and political officials from the Pentagon, State Department and intelligence community agreed that there had been no change in Tehran\u2019s behavior to justify invoking emergency authorities and advised against doing so, according to a former administration official who attended the meetings.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing going on right now that we could point to that would say it was any different than the month before,\u201d the former official said.\n\nFurther, some of the weapons included in the sale \u2014 $8 billion worth of guided missiles for Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, bombs for Jordan, and other items \u2014 would not come online for at least a year.\n\n\u201cOur conclusion was, \u2018Nobody supports this being an emergency, so we think that the declaration wouldn\u2019t have any grounds and we shouldn\u2019t do it,\u2019\u201d the ex-official added. Details of the meetings, including a May gathering of the National Security Council Deputies Committee, later made their way to Capitol Hill, reinforcing concerns among lawmakers about the arms sales and prompting legislative action to reverse the transactions.\n\nPompeo decided to go ahead with the emergency invocation anyway after consulting with then-acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan during an informal breakfast meeting, the former administration official said.\n\nWhile the Pentagon supported the sale itself, at the time senior officials including Shanahan expressed concern with the decision to invoke emergency authorities given the resistance in Congress, said one defense official. However, looking back, Iran\u2019s activities over the past year since the decision \u201cbore out the fact that there was an emergency,\u201d the official said.\n\n\u201cYou look at Iranian behavior over the subsequent 12 months, including attacks on Saudi oil refineries, shooting down a U.S. drone, a ballistic missile attack on U.S. forces in Iraq \u2014 it\u2019s clear that a reasonable argument can be made that there was a crisis pending when this sale was approved,\u201d the official said.\n\nPompeo formally invoked the emergency authority on May 24. The State Department did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe move infuriated lawmakers from both parties. Current law requires the executive branch to formally notify Congress of an arms sale of this nature; the House and Senate then have 30 days to vote to block the sale.\n\nAt the time, it was thought to be highly unlikely that a weapons sale to Riyadh would pass muster in Congress, where lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have become increasingly skeptical of the U.S. relationship with the kingdom. The regime\u2019s killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi and its continued participation in Yemen\u2019s bloody civil war have prompted several lawmakers to propose sanctions against the Saudi government, a longtime close but often nettlesome American ally.\n\nThe issue was thrust back into the headlines this week when it was revealed that State Department Inspector General Steve Linick, whom President Donald Trump fired last Friday, was investigating the arms sale.\n\nPompeo reiterated Wednesday that he had asked the president to fire Linick, who was also looking into claims that the secretary and his wife improperly directed political appointees to run personal errands for him, including walking his dog and picking up his dry cleaning.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen the various stories that someone was walking my dog to sell arms to my dry cleaner,\u201d Pompeo said, mocking the allegations. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s all just crazy. It\u2019s all crazy stuff.\u201d\n\nBut he did acknowledge that he had responded to written questions about another matter, an apparent reference to the Saudi arms sale.\n\n\u201cI responded to those questions. I don\u2019t know the scope, I don\u2019t know the nature of that investigation, other than what I would have seen from the nature of the questions that I was presented,\u201d Pompeo said. \u201cI did what was right. I don\u2019t know if that investigation is continuing. I don\u2019t know if that investigation has been closed out. I don\u2019t have any sense of that.\u201d\n\nCongressional sources on both sides of the Capitol said some aides and senators caught wind of the May 2019 meeting shortly after it happened \u2014 specifically, that the gathering included mostly career officials who said there was no legitimate basis to declare a national emergency under the Arms Export Control Act.\n\nIn the months that followed, several senators who sit on relevant committees had informal conversations with officials who were present at the May meeting, according to a source familiar with the discussions.\n\nSome congressional committees were later briefed on the State Department\u2019s internal deliberations at the time, according to aides, who said it was decided among the group that an emergency declaration was the easiest way to avoid a congressional vote. But through the official channels, lawmakers were in the dark about how exactly the Trump administration came to its decision to invoke emergency powers, including whether a legal analysis had been completed, the aides added.\n\nThat led a group of senators to introduce 22 joint resolutions last June to overturn the emergency authorities, led by Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.). The cohort included Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), a Trump ally who has soured on the Saudis in recent years. At the time, the senators argued that the administration was deliberately ignoring longstanding precedents on consulting with Congress. All 22 measures ultimately passed both the House and Senate, but Trump vetoed them.\n\n\u201cNow is not the time to do business as usual with Saudi Arabia,\u201d Graham said last year. \u201cI am also very concerned about the precedent these arms sales would set by having the administration go around legitimate concerns of the Congress.\u201d\n\nPOLITICO NEWSLETTERS POLITICO Playbook Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics.

And by the time some relevant officials were read in, it was a foregone conclusion.\n\nRather than hold multiple meetings at the State Department with numerous officials \u2014 as is more typical of the process to greenlight arms sales \u2014 Pompeo would summon individual subject-matter experts up to his office on the seventh floor for small conversations, per the official. And for months after making the declaration, he received detailed weekly briefings on the status of the weapons systems and the timeline for their delivery.\n\nTrump and Pompeo have maintained their support for Saudi Arabia despite these events. Trump\u2019s first overseas trip as president was to Riyadh, where he met with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, with whom he has cultivated a close relationship.\n\nTrump stood by his Saudi counterpart and resisted congressional efforts to impose human-rights sanctions even after U.S. intelligence officials briefed lawmakers on their conclusion that the crown prince directed the murder of Khashoggi.\n\nState Department officials were recently briefed about Linick\u2019s conclusions in the probe.

The buoyed reserve that has resulted has now a point of pride for the administration. The president has called himself the \u201cking of ventilators\u201d and plans to send some of the expensive machines to other countries facing shortages. The Rawsonville plant has promised to manufacture 50,000 ventilators by July 4.\n\nYet the visit was not without controversy.\n\nIn the days leading up to it, questions were raised about whether or not the president would wear a mask while touring the facility, as the Ford plant requires for safety reasons. Trump previously opted to not wear a mask during a visit last week to the medical equipment factory in Pennsylvania.\n\nFord initially released a statement saying the plant notified the White House of its mask requirement, then later clarified the decision would be left to the White House. Michigan\u2019s attorney general then wrote an open letter to the president saying it was his \u201clegal responsibility\u201d to wear a protective face covering, given current state orders.\n\n\u201cI ask that while you are on tour you respect the great efforts of the men and women at Ford \u2014 and across this state \u2014 by wearing a facial covering,\u201d wrote Attorney General Dana Nessel.\n\nOn Thursday, Ford issued a statement saying CEO Bill Ford \"encouraged President Trump to wear a mask when he arrived,\" and that the president complied \"during a private viewing of three Ford GTs from over the years.\"\n\nThe statement added: \"The president later removed the mask for the remainder of the visit.\u201d\n\nThe president also lobbed political grenades at Michigan\u2019s Democratic leaders earlier this week.\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump threatened to withhold federal funds from Michigan after accusing the state, without evidence, of \u201cillegally\u201d sending absentee ballots to voters.\n\n\u201cThis was done illegally and without authorization by a rogue Secretary of State,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cI will ask to hold up funding to Michigan if they want to go down this Voter Fraud path!\u201d\n\nLater, he corrected his tweet \u2014 the state is sending only applications for absentee ballots, not actual ballots \u2014 and said it might not be necessary to withhold any funds. But he still expressed anger over the state\u2019s strategy on Thursday, claiming without evidence at several points that it would lead to fraud.\n\n\u201cWe don't want anyone to do mail-in ballots,\u201d he said before departing the White House. \u201cNow, if someone has to mail it in because they're sick or by the way because they live in the White House and they have to vote on Florida, and they won't be in Florida and there's a reasoning for it, that's OK.\u201d\n\nThe president\u2019s visit also comes at a fraught time for the state as Midland County, located north of Detroit, faces catastrophic flooding that has forced thousands to evacuate their homes. Trump\u2019s schedule did not include a visit to the devastated area. And Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer was not invited to meet the president while he was on the ground in Michigan.\n\nTrump on Thursday offered assurances that the federal government would support the local recovery, including with Federal Emergency Management Agency staffers.", "link": "https://www.politico.com/news/2020/05/21/trump-coronavirus-michigan-273885", "published": "2020-05-21T00:00:00", "author": []}, {"title": "White House weighs shorter extension of nuclear arms pact with Russia", "text": "\"Both approaches are available, or a mix thereof,\" said a State Department spokesperson who asked not to be named.\n\nNew START is one of the last remaining pacts aimed at keeping the world's largest atomic arsenals in check. But concerns have grown among Republicans and Democrats that President Donald Trump could walk away just as he has jettisoned the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty with Russia and the Obama-era nuclear pact with Iran.\n\nThe administration's potential approach has gained traction in recent weeks as the Trump administration faces growing criticism that Trump\u2019s goal of negotiating a broader nuclear treaty with both Moscow and Beijing before New START expires is unrealistic and, if it fails, risks igniting a full-blown nuclear arms race.\n\n\u201cThere are a host of options or steps that could be taken to accomplish the president\u2019s direction, some of which could be done in fairly short order,\u201d said an administration official also involved in the deliberations. \u201cThere's not a one-size-fits-all model.\u201d\n\nArms control experts raised a number of questions and concerns, noting that the approach still poses a risk to New START with no guarantee that any follow-on pact would be as enforceable.\n\nBut it also has intriguing possibilities, said Jon Wolfsthal, who oversaw nuclear policy on the National Security Council in the Obama administration.\n\n\"A six-month extension to buy yourself some time to negotiate something new with the Russians \u2014 and call on the Chinese to join \u2014 inherently isn't bad,\" said Wolfsthal, who is now a senior adviser to Global Zero, a disarmament group. \"It might be a way to square the circle \u2014 if you can also be sure that the next administration has the leeway to extend [New START] more.\"\n\nNew START, which was signed by President Barack Obama and Vladimir Putin in 2010 and ratified by the Senate, limits strategic nuclear arms on both sides to 1,550. It also includes detailed verification measures such as on-site inspections to ensure both sides are complying.\n\nRussia said publicly late last year it is willing to extend the treaty the full five years without preconditions. So far, the Trump administration has insisted that the treaty is flawed because it doesn't cover a series of nuclear arms in the Russian arsenal such as tactical warheads.\n\nThe U.S. has not committed to an extension of the treaty and says Trump instead wants to replace it with a more comprehensive agreement that covers more classes of weapons to include stringent verification measures.\n\n\u201cThis is crucial because we\u2019re talking about two countries with abysmal track records in terms of treaty compliance,\u201d Marshall Billingslea, Trump's special envoy for arms control, recently told the Washington Times. \u201cRussia has violated nearly every single agreement we\u2019ve ever had with them \u2014 and the Chinese stand in violation of a number of agreements that they\u2019ve also signed.\u201d\n\nOfficials said the first element of the strategy now under serious consideration would be an extension of New START, but for a significantly shorter duration that the maximum five years permitted under the treaty.\n\nWolfsthal said one major issue is whether the treaty could legally be extended again if the U.S. and Russia \u2014 not to mention China \u2014 failed to reach any follow-on agreement before the New START extension ran out.\n\n\"Could you have multiple extensions as long as those multiple extensions don't exceed a five-year period?\" he asked. \"There is some concern that this administration, in order to kill New START, would say we are going to extend six months, but then you burn your bridge. Others are saying, 'No, you can extend for six months and then extend for four-and-a-half years or three years, as long as the extension periods don't total more than five years.'\"\n\nAn even more controversial move would be to pursue a new agreement with Moscow that doesn't clearly spell out how compliance would be guaranteed.\n\nA former government official who closely tracks nuclear policy described the administration's evolving thinking as reflecting a growing reality that this late in the president\u2019s term \u2014 and as relations with Russia and China continue to suffer \u2014 the administration is not likely to be able to achieve the kind of historic diplomatic breakthrough Trump has been promising.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think anybody ever thought they were going to get an official deal but they wanted at least [a] gentleman\u2019s agreement,\u201d the former official said. \u201cI\u2019ve heard that used many times in terms of what they want to get from the Russians.\u201d\n\nThe administration could seek a \u201cone-year or two-year extension of the treaty while they get something \u2014 a gentleman\u2019s agreement is probably too light, I think they wanted something in writing,\u201d the former official explained. \u201cBut it wouldn\u2019t be a binding legal document. I think it would just be in principle.\u201d\n\nAdded the State Department spokesperson: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t necessarily need to look just like New START.\"\n\nSome officials have held out the prospect of a follow-on agreement more akin to the 2002 Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty, also known as the Moscow Treaty.\n\nSigned by Putin and then-President George W. Bush, it called for further cuts to nuclear arms on both sides but was less prescriptive than similar treaties and included fewer constraints on how each side could carry out its commitments. Some critics used its acronym to call it the \"sort of\" treaty.\n\nBut a major element at the time was that START I, which predated New START, was still in place for seven more years, and the Moscow Treaty was able to piggyback on its verification measures.\n\n\"You still had inspectors on the ground in both countries,\" said Wolfsthal. \"You still had a fence around their missile production facilities and X-rayed what went out. The intelligence community could certify that we have high confidence that Russia's was complying with the Treaty of Moscow because of the START verification provisions.\"\n\nWithout new verification procedures, a short extension of New START would unlikely offer such backup \u2014 and that gives arms control advocates pause.\n\n\"Gambling with the benefits that New START provides on a very low-odds-of-success bet that a short-term extension will convince the Russians and the Chinese to come to the table and meet our terms does not strike me as a smart or responsible approach,\" said Kingston Reif, director for disarmament and threat reduction policy at the Arms Control Association.\n\nThe State Department, however, says it hopes to restart talks with Russia as soon as possible and reiterated its invitation for China to join the discussions.\n\n\"Russia has stated that it has no preconditions to extension, which is a position that we will remember,\" said the spokesperson. \"In December 2019 we separately formally invited China in good faith to begin a strategic security dialogue on nuclear risk reduction, arms control, and their future. We hope to begin this as soon as possible. We await Beijing\u2019s response.\"\n\nBut the biggest immediate question, says Wolfsthal, may be whether Trump can be convinced to take the first step.\n\n\"The central question is whether there is a way to convince Trump to extend an Obama treaty,\" he said. \"There is a lot of doubt about that.\"\n\nLara Seligman and Nahal Toosi contributed to this report.", "link": "https://www.politico.com/news/2020/05/20/white-house-russia-nuclear-271729", "published": "2020-05-20T00:00:00", "author": []}, {"title": "House leaders agree to vote on amendment restricting surveillance of internet browsing", "text": "The Lofgren measure is expected to closely mirror one that narrowly failed in the Senate offered by Sens.

But despite serving on the House Intelligence and Judiciary committees, Ratcliffe was something of a puzzle to key Republican senators, and he soon withdrew his name amid questions about whether he had inflated his resume.\n\nRatcliffe got a second nod from Trump this year after serving on the president\u2019s impeachment defense team. And by Thursday, even Senate Democrats were eager to see Ratcliffe succeed acting Intelligence Director Richard Grenell, a Trump ally who has used his temporary perch to push organizational changes to the national security apparatus.\n\nGrenell, who is also the U.S. ambassador to Germany, has also provided Congress with newly declassified documents related to the prosecution of former national security adviser Michael Flynn and the FBI\u2019s Russia investigation. Democrats contend that the GOP is politicizing those documents to attack former President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nIn contrast, Ratcliffe had vowed at his confirmation hearing to be independent and deliver unvarnished intelligence assessments to Trump, even if he believed it would risk his job.\n\nStill, Democrats don't seem entirely convinced.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said before the vote that he had asked Ratcliffe earlier this week if he agreed with the intelligence community\u2019s initial January 2017 assessment that Russia had interfered in the last presidential election with the goal of putting Trump in the Oval Office \u2014 a finding recently backed the Senate Intelligence Committee.\n\n\u201cHe could not confirm it,\u201d Schumer said.\n\nHe said he also asked Ratcliffe to brief the congressional \u201cGang of Eight\u201d every two weeks on election interference and requested that Congress be notified within 72 hours if Russia or another country attempts to interfere in U.S. elections.\n\n\u201cIn neither case could he commit,\u201d Schumer said.\n\nAfter the vote, Virginia Sen. Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, said \"nothing would be better than to be proved wrong on\" concerns about Ratcliffe's independence and partisan history.\n\n\"But time will tell. With Coats, we made that leap, and he ended up being independent. I hope to see the same from Mr. Ratcliffe,\" Warner told POLITICO.\n\nRepublican accolades rolled in after the Senate vote.\n\nIn a statement, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), who was tapped earlier this week to serve as the acting chairman of the Intelligence panel, said it was \"critical to have a Senate-confirmed DNI ensuring the wide array of intelligence agencies are sharing information across lines, coordinating capabilities\" and furthering U.S. national security goals.\n\n\"Director Ratcliffe understands this responsibility, and I am confident that he will fulfill all of the roles assigned to the DNI with integrity,\" Rubio added.\n\nRatcliffe is a \"man of character who will bring strength and accountability to the role,\" House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy wrote in a tweet.\n\nMeanwhile, Grenell tweeted: \"Congratulations, @RepRatcliffe !

McConnell has already largely ignored much of the Democrat-led House\u2019s legislation for the past year and a half.\n\nBut his remarks about the constitutionality of remote voting suggest that McConnell could refuse to take up a House bill on the grounds that it was not legitimately adopted by the chamber. And it was clear that McConnell does not want to set a precedent for a practice he has vehemently opposed for the Senate, which also requires in-person attendance in order to vote on the floor. The Senate does allow proxy voting in committee.\n\nThe Senate has been in session for the past three weeks as McConnell and GOP leaders urge a return to regular business.\n\nBut the House has been largely on recess, and last week the chamber adopted new procedures \u2014 over the strong objections of Republicans \u2014 that allow members to cast their votes by proxy. The rule change is only valid for 45-day periods that can be extended during the coronavirus pandemic, and it applies only to the 116th Congress, which ends in January.\n\nHouse Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) suggested Republicans will file a legal challenge once the procedure is used. Aware of that threat, House Democrats are planning to employ it first on FISA, a bill modified by the Senate after House passage. GOP leaders and the intelligence community have pushed hard for the FISA reauthorization, so if House Republicans choose to file a lawsuit, it will endanger a bill Republicans support.\n\nYet McConnell said there were clear legal issues with the plan, noting that the Constitution requires a physical quorum in order to do business.\n\n\u201cFor about 231 years, Congresses have managed to fulfill this job requirement,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cThey\u2019ve worked through a Civil War, two world wars, terrorist threats, and a prior pandemic without trying to shirk this duty.\u201d\n\nIn statements to POLITICO, Pelosi and Hoyer hit back at McConnell, saying the House gets to decide its own procedures. They also noted that McConnell has stalled hundreds of House-passed bills anyway, downplaying his threat as largely meaningless.\n\n\u201cRemote voting by proxy is fully consistent with the Constitution and more than a century of legal precedent, including Supreme Court cases, that make clear the House can determine its own rules,\u201d Pelosi said. \u201cLeader McConnell\u2019s comments are deliberately misleading, as proxy voting has long been used by Senate committees. Simply and sadly, he is trying to find every excuse not to meet the needs of the American people.\u201d\n\n\u201cArticle I, Section 5, clause 2 of the Constitution gives each house of Congress the ability to set its own rules. The courts have previously given the House wide latitude to do so, and the rule change we made to maintain public health fits within those bounds,\u201d Hoyer added. \u201cThere is no reason why we should put lives at risk when technology can enable us to meet remotely \u2014 just as Senate committees have done.\u201d\n\n", "link": "https://www.politico.com/news/2020/05/21/mitch-mcconnell-democrats-proxy-voting-273615", "published": "2020-05-21T00:00:00", "author": []}, {"title": "GOP leaders rebuke Republican House candidate over insulting social media posts", "text": "The statements came less than a day after a second POLITICO story about Howze\u2019s past social media activity.

The state-funded office oversees appointed defense counsel in appellate cases covering four California counties, including Monterey County, where the prosecution often tapped Reade as an expert witness.\n\nThe review will determine whether the attorneys can petition a judge to review their clients\u2019 conviction, and potentially order a new trial.\n\n\u201cI have at least six cases where she testified and I have lists pending from various attorney groups where she testified as a violence expert. I expect that list will expand significantly,\u201d McKenna said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to get the lists together. We\u2019re aware of Ms. Reade, we\u2019re in the mode of trying to review the transcripts to see if she misrepresented herself in court.\u201d\n\nHe said the calls for a review came as news reports raised questions about her background and detailed her credentials, including the fact that she did not complete an undergraduate degree.\n\n\u201cLast week, I was informed she testified as an expert. Last week, I was also informed she lied about her credentials. I didn\u2019t connect the dots on the significance of those two things until yesterday when I was contacted by an attorney,\u201d McKenna said.\n\nThe concerns about Reade\u2019s testimony come after she leveled sexual assault charges against Biden in March. In 2019, Reade at first alleged sexual harassment, but she has since explained that she wasn\u2019t yet ready to tell the full story \u2014 an experience Reade and her attorney argue is common with victims of abuse.\n\nReade has written and talked extensively about her own experience as a victim of domestic violence. In 1996, a judge in San Luis Obispo Superior Court authorized a temporary restraining order against Reade\u2019s then-husband. Her former husband has denied her claims.\n\nAn attorney for Jennifer Vasquez, a woman convicted of attempted murder, said he is currently reviewing options for his client in the wake of recent revelations about Reade.\n\nIn that December 2018 case, Reade gave an account of her educational background that conflicts with the account of university officials. When asked to detail her credentials as an expert in domestic violence in the case, Reade testified that she had a law degree from Seattle University and graduated from Antioch University in Seattle with a bachelor\u2019s degree.\n\nKaren Hamilton, a spokeswoman for Antioch University, said in a statement that Reade did not graduate and was never a faculty member. Reade attended Antioch for three academic quarters, in 2000 and part of 2001, the university said.\n\nReade declined to comment for this story and instead texted a screenshot from a previously published article where she claimed she obtained an undergraduate degree under a special arrangement with a former chancellor of the university, Toni Murdock. CNN first reported on questions regarding Reade\u2019s educational background.\n\nHowever, university officials conferred with Murdock, an Antioch official told POLITICO, and confirmed that no special arrangement existed.\n\nSeattle University School of Law confirmed that Reade graduated from there in 2004. According to a 2009 article in the law school\u2019s alumni magazine, Reade entered law school under an alternative admission program.\n\nIn a follow-up question about whether students in that program can be admitted without a bachelor\u2019s degree, a spokesman pointed to current requirements, which require an undergraduate degree.\n\n\u201cOur current admission requirements are publicly posted on the Seattle University School of Law website, which apply to all admitted students,\u201d David Sandler said. \u201cAs in the past, they are consistent with American Bar Association standards for law schools. Federal privacy regulations prevent us from sharing additional information about the educational records of former students.\u201d\n\nReade also appears to have embellished her role in Biden\u2019s office. Reade served in his Senate office from December 1992 to July 1993 as a staff assistant, a relatively junior position. Reade has said she managed interns for a time. But when queried about her job experience at the trial, Reade referred to herself as a legislative assistant, a more senior job classification that conveyed more responsibility, according to the transcript.\n\n\u201cI worked with domestic violence prevention for over 20-some years in different capacities. I started working for U.S. Senator Joseph Biden. I was a legislative assistant. He worked on the Violence Against Women Act, the federal act,\u201d Reade testified.\n\nShe was later asked whether her degree from Antioch University was in political science.\n\n\u201cLiberal arts, yeah,\u201d Reade responded.\n\n\u201cBut your r\u00e9sum\u00e9 says liberal,\u201d the attorney followed up.\n\n\u201cYeah. The focus was political science. I worked for Leon Panetta and Joe Biden and then moved on to King County prosecutor's office,\u201d she said.\n\nIn response to a question from the lawyer about whether she was being compensated, Reade said she was paid a stipend and provided with a hotel room.\n\nVasquez\u2019s attorney, Scott Erdbacher \u2014 who directed questioning and whose objection to her as an expert witness was overruled by the judge overseeing the case \u2014 said he is revisiting the issue.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just looking at it to see if there is a reason to reopen it,\u201d Erdbacher told POLITICO. \u201c I\u2019m sure that anybody who had her on a case will be looking into it very closely. Her testimony in cases, especially if her credibility is a problem, those are all things we would have asked her at trial that would have influenced the outcome.\u201d\n\nPrior to her testimony in the Vasquez case, defense attorneys were given Reade\u2019s r\u00e9sum\u00e9, a copy of which was provided to POLITICO.\n\nPOLITICO NEWSLETTERS POLITICO Playbook Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics.

A second person, who was briefed on the matter, confirmed that the inspector general\u2019s office was nearly finished with a probe of Henderson\u2019s activities. A State Department official, meanwhile, confirmed that Fisher was also under scrutiny as part of the investigation.\n\nHenderson has worked in the past as an aide to former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. Although already serving as the chief of protocol, she still faced a confirmation hearing in the Senate amid efforts to give her the rank of ambassador, which at times comes with the chief\u2019s job.\n\nFisher previously had worked in the first lady\u2019s office at the White House and also for Christie in the past.\n\nThe State Department official described Henderson as a generally likable person who nonetheless may not have always acted in the best interest of the protocol office. Fisher was not experienced enough for the position she held, the official contended.\n\nState Department spokespeople did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Wednesday. The Office of Protocol referred POLITICO to the spokespeople when asked to be connected to Henderson and Fisher. Lawler, however, did weigh in.\n\n\u201cThere was no workplace violence. All of those accusations were exaggerated and/or false,\u201d Lawler told POLITICO on Wednesday.\n\nAppearing Wednesday at a news conference at the State Department, Pompeo declined to elaborate on the circumstances that led to Linick\u2019s firing. But the secretary emphasized it was he who recommended the inspector general be terminated, saying, \u201cI frankly should have done it some time ago.\u201d\n\nPompeo dismissed as \u201cpatently false\u201d accusations that the ouster represented an act of political retaliation, claiming he had \u201cno sense of what investigations were taking place inside the inspector general\u2019s office\u201d and alluding to recent reports about his alleged misconduct.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen the various stories that someone was walking my dog to sell arms to my dry cleaner. I mean, it\u2019s all just crazy. It\u2019s all crazy stuff,\u201d Pompeo said. He did concede, however, there was \u201cone exception.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was asked a series of questions in writing. I responded to those questions with respect to a particular investigation. That was some time earlier this year, as best I can recall,\u201d Pompeo said, appearing to refer to the revelation in a New York Times story that he had responded to written questions about his handling of arms sales to Saudi Arabia.\n\n\u201cI responded to those questions. I don\u2019t know the scope, I don\u2019t know the nature of that investigation, other than what I would have seen from the nature of the questions that I was presented,\u201d Pompeo continued. \u201cI did what was right. I don\u2019t know if that investigation is continuing. I don\u2019t know if that investigation has been closed out. I don\u2019t have any sense of that.\u201d\n\nThe secretary went on to accuse Sen. Bob Menendez, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, of leaking damaging stories to members of the media, and invoked the New Jersey lawmaker\u2019s 2015 indictment on federal corruption charges. The Justice Department dropped its case against Menendez in 2018.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t get my ethics guidance from a man who was criminally prosecuted. \u2026 A man for whom his Senate colleagues, bipartisan, said basically that he was taking bribes,\u201d Pompeo told reporters. \u201cThat\u2019s not someone who I look to for ethics guidance. And so I\u2019ll continue to do the right thing to make sure the State Department is served by every employee, including our inspector general.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe facts speak for themselves,\u201d Menendez fired back in a statement. \u201cSecretary Pompeo now faces an investigation into both this improper firing and into his attempt to cover up his inappropriate and possibly illegal actions. Not surprisingly, he has lashed out at me and others conducting congressional oversight. The fact that Secretary Pompeo is now trying diversion tactics by attempting to smear me is as predictable as it is shameful. The secretary should focus on answering questions and getting his story straight as to why he wanted to target IG Linick.\u201d\n\nPompeo did not directly address concerns about the protocol office, which handles a variety of tasks related to diplomatic engagements and encounters, ranging from handling gift giving involving foreign leaders to explaining the proper behavior U.S. officials should display in other countries.\n\nOn Tuesday, NBC News reported that State Department officials had growing concerns about a series of events called \u201cMadison Dinners\u201d \u2014 named after former President James Madison, and the diplomatic reception room at State Department headquarters that bears his name \u2014 that have been hosted by Pompeo and his wife since he took over as secretary in spring 2018.\n\nSome U.S. diplomats felt the dinners were an extravagant use of taxpayer dollars that were more aimed at bolstering Pompeo\u2019s political connections ahead of a potential future run for office. Some noted that if the dinners were designed to improve the stature of the department, they should have been publicized. And if they were genuinely focused on foreign policy, then State Department diplomats with knowledge of the subject matters should have been invited, some said.\n\nThe person familiar with the issue said that the inspector general\u2019s office was aware of concerns about the dinners, but that at first glance they appeared to be carefully organized to meet any legal requirements.\n\nThe dinners had come up as part of Linick\u2019s look into the activities of another State Department official, Toni Porter, a longtime confidante who has accompanied Pompeo from his days as a Kansas congressman to the CIA to Foggy Bottom.\n\nState Department officials have raised concerns about whether Porter was appropriately spending her time on government matters, as opposed to topics that were more personal or political in nature when it came to the Pompeos.\n\nPorter did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Wednesday that Pompeo should testify before Congress, describing both Trump\u2019s pattern of firing inspectors general and the reports coming out about Pompeo in recent days as \u201cscandalous.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe should come up and testify, but he should be coming up here to testify in general,\u201d Pelosi told reporters of Pompeo. \u201cLet\u2019s see how this unfolds. It\u2019s just in the last 24 hours or 36 hours that we\u2019re seeing what this is. But what it is, what we know so far, is scandalous.\u201d\n\nPelosi conceded that hearing from Pompeo was unlikely given Trump\u2019s icy relationship with her and other Democrats. The White House has made a show of blocking other high profile administration officials from testifying in the House while allowing them to appear before the Republican-controlled Senate.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very hard to get the administration to honor its responsibilities to the American people by testifying before Congress,\u201d Pelosi said. \u201cAs you see, they\u2019ve sort of cut out the House all together.\u201d\n\nHeather Caygle contributed to this report.", "link": "https://www.politico.com/news/2020/05/20/fired-state-department-watchdog-was-probing-protocol-office-270660", "published": "2020-05-20T00:00:00", "author": []}, {"title": "EU privacy enforcer hits make-or-break moment", "text": "The yearlong restructuring, which culminated last fall, capped a lengthy transformation for the watchdog from bit player to the Western world's first line of defense against misuses of people's data. As many Silicon Valley companies have international headquarters in Dublin, the country's regulator has overarching powers to enforce the European Union's tough privacy standards.\n\nBut the agency's face-lift also contributed to confusion about its ability to enforce the law, according to more than two dozen current and former Irish data protection officials, other countries' European privacy regulators, tech company executives, data protection lawyers and privacy campaigners. Many spoke to POLITICO on the condition of anonymity due to their ongoing relationships with Ireland's Data Protection Commission (DPC).\n\nThe internal changes were not well communicated outside the DPC, leaving some across the bloc in doubt over who was in charge of high-profile cases, according to officials at other EU agencies. People who had filed complaints with the regulator went months without a response, raising questions about how officials were enforcing the rules. Other European watchdogs began to voice concerns in public that the region's flagship privacy standards were not being enforced.\n\n\"Nothing has really changed,\" said Fred Logue, a privacy lawyer in Dublin who has filed multiple cases on behalf of clients with Ireland's privacy watchdog, adding that months would go by without hearing from officials. \"When you deal with them, you don't get the sense that they are there to vindicate data protection rights.\"\n\nThe agency's restructuring was the latest headache for the regulator two years after Europe's landmark privacy overhaul, known as the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, came into force in late May 2018.\n\nOver that time, Helen Dixon, the agency's head, and her staff of more than 140 regulators have yet to complete any of their investigations into Big Tech. Europe's new laws allow officials to impose fines of up to 4 percent of a company's global revenue, or potentially billions of euros, for failures to protect people's personal information. They've become the de facto global standard from Colombia to Japan, an achievement Brussels is eager to promote.\n\nYet discussions with both advocates and critics of Dublin's oversight reveal a picture of an agency struggling to come to terms with a powerful new regulatory weapon, with little experience or training about how to wield it. Last year, the agency received more than 7,000 data protection complaints, a record high. It's working through a backlog of cases as EU agencies are still trying to figure out how best to enforce the rules.\n\n\"We're dealing with a new framework,\" Dixon told POLITICO at the agency's Georgian townhouse headquarters in central Dublin, just a stone's throw from the country's parliament, in early March. She rejected claims her agency had been slow to act. \u201cWe are now on a pathway where we are going to resolve, one by one, as fast as we can with as many resources as we can, these very entrenched issues.\u201d\n\nPressure on Ireland\n\nWith the two-year anniversary of Europe's privacy standards coming next Monday, Dixon is under mounting pressure to show that her agency can act.\n\nSignificant fines and orders for change against both Facebook and Twitter are still expected by early summer, almost a year after the enforcement actions were originally expected.\n\nIt will be a make-or-break moment for the privacy regulator \u2014 and for Europe's boasts that it's the global trendsetter on privacy.\n\nFor the agency defenders, its slow pace in taking on cases, putting together bulletproof investigations and figuring out how to enforce Europe's new data protection laws is a sign that Dixon and her team are taking their beefed-up role seriously. The bloc's revamped privacy regime, advocates insist, does not give enough detail on how to implement the rules, particularly for policing multinational tech giants, It has been left mostly to the Irish to fill in the gaps.\n\n\"It's ten times more complicated, and regulators aren't ten times as big,\" said Eduardo Ustaran, global co-head of the privacy and cybersecurity practice at Hogan Lovells, a law firm, in London. \"Nothing really could have prepared them for the size of GDPR.\"\n\nOthers disagree. They point to multiple delays in even straightforward cases, including probes into publicly-disclosed misuse of social media data, as a sign that Dublin is not taking its role seriously.\n\nPrivacy advocates and some EU regulators grumble that despite Ireland's backlog of complaints, it is still dragging its feet on investigations that stretch back years, giving companies too much leeway in enforcing the rules and fostering a too close relationship with those it oversees.\n\n\"If a train never gets moving, less locomotives don't cause further delays,\" said Max Schrems, an Austrian privacy campaigner who has become the Irish regulator's quasi-b\u00eate noire after pushing them to take action, mostly against Facebook, since the early 2010s.\n\nStruggling to keep up\n\nIn discussions with Irish regulators, European counterparts and others involved in Europe's new privacy regime, POLITICO pieced together how Dublin struggled to cope with its expanded role.\n\nA major stumbling block has been creating watertight legal cases needed to levy hefty fines because, under the bloc's previous privacy regime that dated back to the mid-1990s, Dublin did not have the authority to issue financial penalties for wrongdoing. Under Irish law, it did gain lengthy litigation experience around privacy violations. But without a track record of financial enforcement, regulators have been racing to get up to speed just as pressure to act becomes ever more acute.\n\nThat left some within the agency anxious to avoid procedural mistakes \u2014 particularly when dealing with untested, new privacy standards \u2014 that could be unpicked in eventual appeals. Irish law provided little breathing space for such legal missteps, according to several local privacy experts.\n\nFor outsiders, the delays proved frustrating.\n\n\"You don't hear anything about cases transferred to Ireland,\" said Johannes Caspar, head of Hamburg's data protection regulator, whose agency is the first port of call for privacy complaints about almost all U.S. tech firms in Germany. \"What goes on, what type of information was exchanged, we don't get any of that. We're here just standing and waiting.\"\n\nGraham Doyle, a spokesman for the Irish authority, said other regulators could ask Dublin for updates on the ongoing cases during monthly meetings of EU privacy agencies.\n\nDifficulties began soon after Europe's new privacy rules began in May 2018.\n\nDays into the new regime, the regulator was flooded with requests, both from locals and people abroad who wanted to take advantage of the new privacy protections to land major complaints.\n\nSome, like those lodged by Schrems, garnered international attention and focused on Big Tech's data collection practices. Currently, Dublin has 23 open cases into the likes of Microsoft, Apple and Facebook, which is under investigation for everything from mundane data breaches to complex probes into how the company makes money from Europeans' personal information. The social networking giant declined to comment for this article.\n\nThe influx of work represented a challenge for a staff that had grown from just 29 when Dixon took over in 2014 (when the agency was mostly based over a small convenience store in a Portarlington, a small town in central Ireland) to a team of roughly 175 by the end of this year, spread over three different locations. Some complaints took months to garner responses, as different units divvied up tasks and regulators juggled to keep people in the loop on how investigations were proceeding, according to those involved in the some of ongoing cases.\n\nLast year, amid a record number of complaints, the agency said it had sent people's cases for enforcement, or closed others' complaints, in just over 80 percent of the 6,904 cases it had received last year, according the DPC's annual report. Roughly 4,500 were concluded without specific enforcement, while 1,100 are now waiting potential fines and other remedies.\n\nCurrently, the watchdog has just under 2,500 open complaints filed since Europe's new privacy rules came into effect in 2018. Dixon, the Irish regulator, said that many cases had been resolved before reaching the need for a formal investigation, and that her team was in regular contact with those who had submitted complaints.\n\nYet Daragh O'Brien, an Irish data protection consultant who filed multiple complaints on behalf of himself and mostly domestic clients, said that months would go by before receiving confirmation the agency had received his requests. Case workers would be replaced by someone new, often without explanation, and few, if any updates, would be sent out to those who had submitted cases. Schrems also said he had yet to receive an update from Dublin on his cases against WhatsApp and Instagram since he filed them almost two years ago. The regulator sent its initial findings to him in those cases earlier this week.\n\n\"When the spotlight is on you, you have to be seen to act,\" said O'Brien.\n\nIreland pushes back\n\nJust as Dublin was plowing through the increased regulatory work, European counterparts piled on the pressure.\n\nAt regular monthly gatherings of the region's privacy agencies, officials would ask for updates on the high-profile cases involving Facebook and other tech giants, and urged Dixon and her colleagues to move faster on enforcement, according to several officials involved in the meetings. Some, including French and German regulators, moved against these companies on their own, with Paris fining Google \u20ac50 million \u2014 a then-record penalty \u2014 in early 2019 for privacy violations. The search giant is appealing that decision.\n\nOfficials at several EU data protection authorities told POLITICO that cases they had sent to Ireland for investigation sat in an internal IT system for Europe's data protection agencies for months with few, if any, updates to the case work. Some, including Hamburg's Caspar, felt they had been left in the dark over how cases involving their citizens were unfolding, despite monthly calls between Ireland and French and German regulators. Ireland recently joined forces with Spain as part of its investigation into Verizon Media.\n\nThose inside the Irish watchdog pushed back against those claims. Officials said they would go months without receiving the necessary information from other EU agencies to push investigations forward despite other regulators chiding Dublin for not moving fast enough. At the regular meetings of the bloc's privacy authorities to update on its case load, the Irish would ask others to lend a hand \u2014 requests that often went unmet.\n\nIrish officials also questioned others' intentions in criticizing their work. They pointed out that few, if any, EU watchdogs had successfully brought enforcement actions against international companies, like banks and other global financial institutions, which fell under other countries' own jurisdictions.\n\nIreland's data protection watchdog \"will eventually come out with a few big decisions and everyone will calm down,\" said Johnny Ryan, chief privacy officer at Brave, a mobile browser, who filed a complaint against Google with the agency, but has yet to receive an update on his case. \"But they're taking more than enough time.\"\n\nInternal changes\n\nAmid this political wrangling, the restructuring of Ireland's privacy watchdog was well underway, with several senior managers leaving the organization late in 2019 just as Dublin was preparing its first blockbuster enforcement action against Facebook.\n\nOfficials like Donna Creaven, former head of supervision and engagement with multinational tech companies, took senior roles in other public sector bodies, according to data from LinkedIn. As part of a recruitment push, the agency said it would hire several senior lawyers and data protection experts for its ongoing investigations. But the benefits package \u2014 maximum salaries for positions posted earlier this year topped out at \u20ac83,740 \u2014 has put off possible candidates, according to four local privacy experts who had considered applying. In response, an Irish official told POLITICO they had been inundated with applications.\n\nJust as the watchdog's revamp was winding down in late 2019, Helen Dixon got some bad news.\n\nPOLITICO NEWSLETTERS Morning Tech Technology news from Washington and Silicon Valley \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox.

The request was both to hire investigators and create new internal structures to reduce the agency's reliance on the justice ministry for back-office functions like IT and human resources support. All EU privacy agencies have been pleading for more resources to handle the increased workload under the region's new rules.\n\nBut the answer was no.\n\nIn October, Irish lawmakers instead doled out an additional \u20ac1.6 million, an 11 percent annual rise, for the agency\u2019s war chest. It was enough to hire up to 40 more employees, but remained well below what many inside had hoped for.\n\n\u201cGovernments all signed up to this law,\u201d Dixon told POLITICO, adding that she was satisfied with the budget increase her agency was given. \u201cIf you want to meet those expectations, additional staff are going to be required.\u201d\n\nThe budget decision came at a delicate time.\n\nIreland's regulators had expected to announce their first major decision against Facebook by the end of 2019. It would be the culmination of years of work and a symbol that Dublin was able to fulfill its role as the West's first line of defense against data protection abuses.\n\nBut amid legal delays, the decision \u2014 linked to how Facebook failed to explain to users how their data would be shared between WhatsApp and the social network, the internet messenger's parent company \u2014 stalled. An announcement was postponed well into 2020.\n\nFor Dublin's supporters, the delay was unavoidable. Better to wait and build cases that would hold up in court, they insist. \"We want to create sustainable solutions to problems that have been around in data protection for a long time,\" Dixon said when asked about why no enforcement action against tech companies had yet to be published. She did not comment on any specific case.\n\nBut for those already losing patience with Ireland, the country's inability to bring Silicon Valley to heel almost two years after Europe's new privacy regime began had started to wear thin.\n\n\"I won't say they did a good job,\" said Caspar, the German regulator, in reference to the Irish privacy watchdog. \"To do a good job, they would need to issue draft (enforcement) decisions.\"\n\nVincent Manancourt contributed reporting from Brussels, Elisa Braun contributed reporting from Paris.", "link": "https://www.politico.com/news/2020/05/21/europe-data-protection-agency-ireland-272889", "published": "2020-05-21T00:00:00", "author": ["Nicholas Vinocur"]}, {"title": "Pompeo blasts Beijing\u2019s national security bill as \u2018death knell\u2019 for Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy", "text": "Previous efforts to bring Hong Kong more closely under Beijing\u2019s control have been met with mass protests in the city, which was a British colony until 1997 when it was handed over to the Chinese.

But \u2014 for now at least \u2014 the Trump team\u2019s tactics also have been restrained enough to keep tensions from spiraling out of control.\n\nThe Trump administration\u2019s approach to Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen\u2019s Wednesday inauguration in illustrative of its broader strategy toward an authoritarian government in Beijing that it views as a long-term threat to U.S. dominance: Push Chinese Communist Party leaders hard, but not to the point of diplomatic rupture or open warfare.\n\nIt is a tactic that has been pursued with added vigor in recent months as the coronavirus pandemic has hardened differences between U.S. and China, while giving Taiwan \u2014 which has seen just seven deaths since the outbreak began \u2014 something to boast about. For better or worse, Taiwan \u2014 whose democracy the Trump administration openly supports, but whose independence it does not \u2014 has become a useful cudgel for the United States.\n\n\u201cNo Taiwan official is going to turn down some expression of help that\u2019s offered on a silver platter from the United States,\u201d said Daniel Russel, a former senior Asia hand in the Obama administration. He added, however, that Taiwan\u2019s leaders have \u201cvery mixed feelings. Without a doubt, they harbor a great fear of being used as a pawn or a chip.\u201d\n\nThe relationship between Washington and Beijing has been on a downward slope for years, and it has grown increasingly ugly under Trump because of a tariff-driven trade war he launched over his belief that China was taking advantage of America on the economic front.\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic emerged in China late last year, and Taiwan, thanks to its past experiences with infectious diseases in the region, recognized the danger early. Its technocrat-driven response has severely limited the outbreak on its soil, and it has since touted its success as a counterpoint to Chinese stumbles. Taiwan has, among other moves, sent face masks to other countries, including the U.S. \u2014 part of a \u201cmask diplomacy\u201d strategy that Beijing also has used.\n\nThe U.S. has seized on Taiwan\u2019s success as a hammer with which to hit China.\n\nThe Trump administration recently called on the World Health Organization to allow Taiwan to participate in meetings of the World Health Assembly, its main decision-making body, under observer status. The assembly met this past week, without the Taiwanese being permitted a role amid Chinese resistance. And America\u2019s push for Taiwan\u2019s inclusion was somewhat ironic given Trump\u2019s own recent threats to quit the World Health Organization.\n\nStill, the Trump administration clearly thought the effort was worth it to put Beijing on the spot.\n\n\u201cThe [People\u2019s Republic of China\u2019s] spiteful action to silence Taiwan exposes the emptiness of its claims to want transparency and international cooperation to fight the pandemic, and makes the difference between China and Taiwan ever more stark,\u201d Pompeo said in a statement.\n\n\u201cTaiwan is a model world citizen,\u201d he added, \u201cwhile the PRC continues to withhold vital information about the virus and its origins.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration is also using Taiwan as a weapon in its battle with China over 5G wireless technology.\n\nEarlier this week, American officials heralded an announcement by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, one of the world\u2019s leading computer chip makers, that it would build a factory in Arizona. The next day, the Commerce Department announced a rule change that could bar Chinese tech giant Huawei from doing business with TSMC and other global chip manufacturers.\n\nThe U.S. and Taiwan do not have formal diplomatic relations, and officially the U.S. has a One China policy that recognizes the regime in Beijing as the government of China. But the U.S. and Taiwan maintain strong unofficial relations, as well as robust economic ties, and it is U.S. policy to help Taiwan defend itself against Beijing.\n\nIn the transition period before he took office, Trump agreed to speak to the Taiwanese president, a deviation from diplomatic norms that, while probably not part of a calculated strategy on Trump\u2019s part, stunned Asia watchers. That incident aside, Trump aides have long seen bolstering Taiwan as critical to their pressure campaign on China\u2019s communist leaders.\n\nPerhaps nowhere has the effort to strengthen ties been clearer than in the military-to-military realm.\n\nLast year, the Trump administration greenlit a controversial F-16 fighter jet sale and a $2.2 billion package of M1A2T Abrams tanks and portable Stinger anti-aircraft missiles that infuriated Beijing.\n\nIn keeping with the increased push for weapons sales to Taiwan, the State Department on Wednesday approved a possible sale of 18 submarine-launched torpedoes for $180 million. The proposed sale will serve as a \u201cdeterrent to regional threats,\u201d the department said.\n\nAs China aggressively builds up its military capability, even signaling an increased willingness to attack Taiwan, U.S. officials are now pushing to normalize weapons sales, sell more advanced equipment and even potentially begin conducting joint naval exercises with the island \u2014 all moves sure to further enrage Beijing.\n\nSome of the moves have been fueled by the coronavirus pandemic, which has \u201cclarified\u201d the competition with China in the public sphere, said Elbridge Colby, a former deputy assistant secretary of Defense. \u201cCovid has made it clear that we are in a situation of competition \u2026 to the American people,\u201d he said.\n\nRandall Schriver, who served as assistant secretary of Defense for Indo-Pacific affairs until January, predicted that Washington will seek to help Taipei further modernize its military, potentially with additional sales of coastal missile defenses, spy drones and other intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities.\n\n\u201cThis was the trajectory that was already planned,\u201d Schriver said. \u201cThe recent experience with coronavirus is an accelerant to some of those plans.\u201d\n\nOfficials have also considered enhanced training, including possible joint naval exercises, as a counter to the growing threat from Beijing, Schriver said. Aside from training associated with major foreign military sales such as the F-16 deal, historically, the U.S. military has refrained from exercising with Taiwan because of China\u2019s sensitivities.\n\nOutside the military realm, Taipei is pressing Washington for additional support. For example, Taiwanese officials are pushing for some kind of bilateral trade deal, Schriver noted. Taiwan is already a major U.S. trading partner.\n\nTaiwan\u2019s leaders have repeatedly expressed gratitude for Trump\u2019s support over the years. For instance, Taiwan was one of a few foreign entities to offer aid to the United States \u2014 $800,000 worth \u2014 as Hurricane Harvey wreaked havoc in 2017, a symbolic move more than anything else.\n\nThis week, amid the inaugural festivities, Tsai\u2019s government expressed its pleasure over receiving the various messages of congratulations from U.S. officials. In particular, it highlighted the video messages sent from Assistant Secretary of State David Stilwell and White House deputy national security adviser Matt Pottinger.\n\nBoth men made subtle digs at China in their comments.\n\nStilwell said \u201cthe world owes Taiwan a debt for ringing the alarm\u201d about the coronavirus crisis early on. Pottinger, speaking in fluent Mandarin, hit a similar point, indirectly tweaking Beijing by reminding it that the illness began on its soil \u2014 a point China has at times sought to dispute through some of its messaging.\n\n\u201cTaiwan learned critical lessons from the 2003 SARS epidemic,\u201d Pottinger said, according to a translation shared on Tsai\u2019s Twitter account, \u201cand applied them in advance of the outbreak of the mysterious disease the Chinese state-controlled media called \u2018Wuhan pneumonia.\u2019\u201d\n\nPompeo did not go so far as to send a video message or engage in a phone call with Tsai, and Trump has kept silent, at least as far as has been publicly acknowledged. Serious direct engagement by a U.S. president or even his chief diplomat could have enraged Beijing well beyond its usual anger at U.S.-Taiwan overtures, analysts said.\n\nBut Pompeo\u2019s issuance of a written congratulatory statement \u2014 which called Taiwan a \u201cforce for good in the world,\u201d referred to Tsai as \u201cTaiwan\u2019s president\u201d and was read aloud during Tsai\u2019s inauguration ceremony \u2014 was a highly unusual, likely unprecedented, move.\n\nThe secretary of State further praised Taiwan during a press conference on Wednesday. However, Pompeo sidestepped a question on whether the U.S. should consider formalizing its relationship with Taipei, instead using the moment to criticize what he said was Beijing\u2019s handling of the pandemic.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re beginning to work to make sure we get America First, that we get this foreign policy right, and that we respond to these risks that the Chinese Communist Party presents to the United States in an appropriate way,\u201d Pompeo said.\n\nChina\u2019s government reacted in harsh but predictable terms to the American expressions of support for Taiwan this week, saying it threatens the bilateral relationship between Beijing and Washington.\n\n\u201cChina will take necessary measures in response to the U.S. erroneous practices, and the consequences will be borne by the U.S. side,\u201d Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said Wednesday.\n\nPeople close to Taiwanese leaders say they are, for the most part, thrilled with the Trump administration\u2019s pro-Taipei bent so far, but there are some lingering disappointments, some centered on diplomatic protocols.\n\nThe fact that no senior U.S. official visits Taiwan, despite U.S. legislation that encourages such travel, is one sore point. Another is the restrictions around the types of meetings Taiwanese representatives get with U.S. diplomats. Taiwan doesn\u2019t have an embassy in Washington; its interests are instead represented by what\u2019s known as the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office.\n\nTaiwanese officials are careful in how they speak about the all-important relationship with the U.S., mindful of Beijing\u2019s red lines. A TECRO representative said that Taiwan was \u201cgrateful for the support from our diplomatic allies, as well as the United States, Japan, and many other like-minded countries on the issue of Taiwan's participation in the World Health Assembly.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the little things,\u201d said one person close to TECRO officials. Trump aides \u201call say, \u2018I love Taiwan, it\u2019s wonderful, it\u2019s the greatest democracy in East Asia.\u2019 But the Taiwanese can\u2019t meet in the State Department. They have to meet in a restaurant.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s also the always unnerving questions about how reliable Trump himself truly is, given his vacillation toward China over the years and his occasional broadsides against longstanding allies.\n\nWhile Trump campaigned for office on an anti-China message, he has generally tried to maintain a good relationship with Chinese leader Xi Jinping. He even praised Xi\u2019s early response to the pandemic, possibly to protect an early-phase trade deal between the two countries and hopes of a bigger deal later.\n\nIn the same vein, Trump has kept to a minimum his comments on China\u2019s human rights abuses in places like Hong Kong, where a pro-democracy movement has been met with crackdowns.\n\nBut Trump also has questioned the One China policy. Just days ago, he floated the idea of ending ties to Beijing, claiming, \u201cYou\u2019d save $500 billion if you cut off the whole relationship.\u201d\n\nPOLITICO NEWSLETTERS Global Translations A newsletter from POLITICO that unpacks essential global news, trends, and decisions.

He\u2019d trade away Taiwan in a heartbeat if he thought it would get him his trade deal with China.\u201d\n\nThere are limits to how far the Trump administration is willing to go for Taiwan.\n\nThe administration appears to have no immediate plans to formally recognize Taiwan\u2019s government, a measure viewed as extreme given Beijing\u2019s longstanding demand that Taipei reunify with China under the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d proposal, Schriver said.\n\nAnd, despite the opportunity posed by the unusually tense relations between the U.S. and China, there\u2019s no discussion of supporting a Taiwanese bid for formal independence from Beijing. Such a move would be so provocative toward China that one senior Trump administration official said the sky \u201cwould fall.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo one has ever talked about independence,\u201d the official said. \u201cEven the hard-core Taiwan lobby in D.C. doesn\u2019t seriously say that.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s probably fine with Taiwan\u2019s current leadership. On the island\u2019s complicated political spectrum it is often cast as pro-independence, but it is also cognizant that declaring all-out independence anytime soon could prompt far more than just tough talk from Beijing.\n\nThe Taiwanese are \u201cpainfully aware of the fact that, while China may have limited options to punish the U.S., it has more options for punishing Taiwan,\u201d Russel said.", "link": "https://www.politico.com/news/2020/05/21/trump-cudgel-china-taiwan-274160", "published": "2020-05-21T00:00:00", "author": ["Adam Behsudi", "Marc Caputo", "Owen Churchill", "South China Morning Post", "Stuart Lau", "Jun Mai", "Wendy Wu"]}, {"title": "Europe learning the dangers of going back to school after coronavirus", "text": "It\u2019s \u201cone of the most difficult things\u201d for policymakers, said Russell Viner, president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health. \u201cIt\u2019s an impossible balancing task.\"\n\nWith no easy answers, Europe hasn\u2019t been able to settle on a consistent approach. Germany began reopening schools in April, with older students returning first. In England, it's the opposite, with primary schools poised to begin reopening in June.\n\nIn Belgium this week, those in the final years of primary and secondary school began to return to school. Italy and Spain, on the other hand, are treading much more cautiously and only reopening schools in September.\n\nTo complicate matters, parents aren\u2019t always on board with their government\u2019s plans. Over 500,000 Britons have signed a petition calling for the right to opt out of sending their children back to school. In Denmark, when schools began to reopen in April, some parents kept their children at home, saying they didn't want them to be \u201cguinea pigs,\u201d Reuters reported.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just the children who need to be considered.\n\n\u201cWe need to think about the risks of both opening schools and keeping them closed to children, parents, teachers and support staff,\u201d said Martin McKee, professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.\n\nWhat all governments are scrutinizing is the science, which they hope will tell them whether it's safe to reopen schools.\n\nWhen the coronavirus first emerged, it quickly became clear that children were relatively unscathed.\n\n\u201cIn every major country, children have been very little affected by Covid-19 if you looked at the overall picture,\u201d said Viner, speaking at a press briefing on May 13. In China, the U.S., Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and the U.K, only around 1 to 2 percent of total coronavirus cases have been in those aged under 18, he noted.\n\nBut in late April, as many governments planned their school reopening schedules, there was a new twist: a rare inflammatory disease affecting some children.\n\nThe emergence of the syndrome, described as Kawasaki-like, prompted the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare an \u201curgent need\u201d for more data on the illness. The WHO also said it's \u201ctemporarily\u201d linking the syndrome to Covid-19, \u201cbased on initial laboratory testing showing positive serology in a majority of patients.\u201d\n\nBut to experts such as Viner and Liz Whittaker, clinical lecturer in pediatric infectious diseases and immunology at Imperial College London, the fact that the syndrome is so rare should mean that it shouldn't influence decisions to keep children at home.\n\n\u201cThe risk of getting severe COVID-19 in young children remains extremely low, despite this serious condition, which will affect very few,\u201d said Whittaker at the same May 13 briefing. \u201cIt shouldn't be a factor ... when decisions are made about when and how to reopen schools.\u201d\n\nPolicymakers aren\u2019t just considering whether children get the virus, but how easily they may spread it \u2014 a reasonable fear given previous evidence of children being super-spreaders of illnesses such as influenza and measles.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s my biggest fear,\u201d Michael Hoelscher, head of infectious diseases and tropical medicine at Munich University Hospital, told the New York Times.\n\nBut the (limited) evidence doesn\u2019t support this.\n\nIreland\u2019s Health Information and Quality Authority has reviewed the data and found that from the small number of studies identified, \u201cchildren are not, to date, substantially contributing to the household transmission of SARS-CoV-2.\u201d\n\nThe one study that analyzed transmission in schools also showed very low spread, although the review admits that the \u201cevidence remains limited.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe WHO\u2019s chief scientist, Soumya Swaminathan, told the BBC's \"Andrew Marr Show\" on May 17 that it seemed that \u201cchildren are less capable of spreading it even if they get the infection.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s this lack of evidence that was cited by the British Medical Association, the U.K.\u2019s doctors' union, when it supported the country\u2019s National Education Union in its opposition to reopening schools before it deemed it safe to do so, reported the Guardian.\n\nMcKee, at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, thinks it is \"premature\" to reopen schools in the U.K. as the country's testing system is \u201cproblematic\u201d and its contact-tracing system \u201cuntested.\u201d\n\nAnd some U.K. local authorities are ready to take matters into their own hands and refusing to reopen their schools, just as some mayors in France did earlier in May.\n\nDevi Sridhar, professor and chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh, believes that local-level data on levels of transmission and daily new cases is needed to inform these decisions.\n\n\u201cThis puts information directly into [the] hands of key members of the educational community,\u201d she wrote on Twitter. \u201cLarge national decisions [are] not optimal in these situations given variance within a country.\u201d\n\nWhen to reopen the schools has been the \u201cmost delicate\u201d issue, said Marius Gilbert, head of the Spatial Epidemiology Laboratory at Universit\u00e9 Libre de Bruxelles and part of the group advising the Belgian government.\n\nIt\u2019s not just the risk of transmission increasing, Gilbert told L\u2019Echo. He warned of another danger \u2013 that of children being cut off from all social life and being deprived of the structure that school gives them.\n\nHarry Quilter-Pinner, senior research fellow at the Institute for Public Policy Research, agreed, calling this \u201cprobably one of the biggest disruptions we\u2019ve faced in the last 100 years in terms of education and schooling.\u201d\n\nFor Quilter-Pinner, the key concern is the widening of the attainment gap, which is the concept that children in deprived areas do worse than their wealthier counterparts.\n\nIndeed, data on England from the Institute for Fiscal Studies finds that during the outbreak, students from wealthier families have been spending more time on home learning and have better access to individualized resources such as private tutoring. Their parents also feel better able to support them.\n\nBut the problems don\u2019t stop when schools reopen.\n\n\u201cThe challenge of reintroduction is not just how do you get people back into classrooms,\u201d said Quilter-Pinner. \u201cIt\u2019s how do you build on what was normal to recover and get back to where we were before.\u201d\n\nReturning to school will require significant logistical challenges, with the need to maintain social distancing and have fewer children in a class, he noted.\n\n\u201cAs a society, we have choices to make,\u201d said Quilter-Pinner, such as addressing how big the risk of reopening schools is and whether we are willing to take that risk.\n\nAlastair Sutcliffe, professor of general pediatrics at University College London, said these decisions are based on considerations of \u201cvarious known risks.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne of the few positive things to come out of COVID is that it very rarely kills children, especially very young children, especially healthy young children,\u201d he said, adding that in reopening schools, we need to consider this very low risk versus other potential risks to children from not returning to school.\n\nWith no clear end to the pandemic in sight, schools will have to be reopened at some point, say experts like Gilbert at Universit\u00e9 Libre de Bruxelles: \u201cIn any case, you will have to learn to live with the virus.\u201d\n\nJames Randerson and Carmen Paun contributed reporting.\n\nThis article is part of POLITICO\u2019s premium policy service: Pro Health Care.

China, on the other hand, is pledging $2 billion to fight the virus.\n\nIt now falls to the WHO secretariat to initiate the independent inquiry \"at the earliest appropriate moment.\"\n\nWhile the U.S. government was the first to call for a pandemic inquiry, Tuesday\u2019s resolution happened largely in spite of the Trump administration, not because of it. The U.S. has annoyed allies by shopping disputed intelligence on the origins of the coronavirus to them and by undercutting global pandemic coordination from the U.N. Security Council through to the G-7. In the end, it was the European Union\u2019s diplomacy that pushed the inquiry resolution toward the finish line.\n\nThe EU\u2019s chief diplomat, Josep Borrell, called on Monday for the rest of the world to step back \u201cfrom the battlefield between China and the United States, who blame each other.\u201d\n\nThe tit-for-tat between the U.S. and China this week is about much more than whether the WHO deserves a billion dollars, more, or less, in efforts to deal with the coronavirus pandemic. They\u2019re sparring over who\u2019s to blame for coronavirus becoming a global mess, while drawing battle lines in longer-term disputes about global economic and political leadership.\n\nChina is no longer subtle or strategic about its global rise, tossing out trade threats and policy bribes on a daily basis. While China won most of the global headlines Monday by offering a $2 billion donation to the global Covid-19 response, it\u2019s also bullying smaller countries that dare to challenge it. Within hours of its donation, China imposed an 80 percent tariff on Australian barley exports to China to retaliate for Australia\u2019s monthlong effort to promote the global pandemic inquiry. Australia was the second country, after the United States, to call for the inquiry.\n\nThe U.S., for its part, has made clear it no longer places the same value on international institutions \u2014 from the U.N. to NATO to the G-7 \u2014 that it helped establish and has used to project its power since World War II. Under Trump, those institutions are expected to align with U.S. interests or lose American support.\n\nPOLITICO NEWSLETTERS China Watcher What\u2019s next in U.S.-China relations.

The WHO stands to lose $400 million, around one-sixth of its total budget, if the U.S. goes ahead next month with the permanent funding cut Trump threatened. And 11 other U.N. agencies depend on U.S. funds even more than the WHO \u2014 the U.S. gives six times that level of WHO funding to the World Food Programme, for example.\n\nThe new U.S. position on the WHO represents a significant reversal from just a year ago. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar praised the \u201cdedicated personal leadership \u201d of the WHO chief and his commitment to WHO reform at the 2019 World Health Assembly.\n\nThe substance of Trump\u2019s WHO criticisms is also in dispute. The Lancet, a prestigious British medical journal, today said Trump\u2019s citation of the journal in the opening paragraphs of his letter to Dr. Adhanom was factually inaccurate .\n\nTrump\u2019s letter complained that the WHO did not publicly support the administration\u2019s partial restrictions on travelers arriving from China, designed as a coronavirus containment measure.\n\nThe WHO said several times through January and February that such travel restrictions would likely be ineffective, and could only be effective if also backed by other measures including \u201cactive surveillance, early detection, isolation and case management, contact tracing and prevention of onward spread.\u201d The U.S. did not implement these measures.\n\nTrump\u2019s letter did not specify which reforms it expected the WHO to make in the next 30 days.\n\nThe potential funding cut won\u2019t necessarily affect the organization\u2019s pandemic work. U.S. funding for the WHO in recent years has been channeled towards polio eradication, tuberculosis and HIV. The Trump administration has already released a first tranche of funds to the WHO in 2020.\n\nThe U.S. government has plenty of options aside from the WHO for supporting the global pandemic response. The World Food Programme, headed by David Beasley, a South Carolina Republican, is looking to raise an extra $965 million to cover the extra logistics costs of feeding 30 million hungry people during the pandemic.", "link": "https://www.politico.com/news/2020/05/19/who-summit-us-china-proxy-battle-268298", "published": "2020-05-19T00:00:00", "author": []}, {"title": "Rep. Jayapal: Trump\u2019s coronavirus response is like \u2018The Hunger Games\u2019", "text": "Particularly frustrating to Jayapal is the continued shortage of medical supplies like personal protective equipment for frontline workers and the long-necked swabs needed for coronavirus tests.\n\n\u201cStates have sort of been left to play out \u2018The Hunger Games\u2019 on procuring swabs,\u201d said Jayapal. \u201cLiterally, we have governors \u2014 my governor included \u2014 calling random people in China to try to get swabs off the back of a truck somewhere and get them here, only to find out then that perhaps they're not validated; they're not good for use. Same thing with PPE.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is no question in my mind that if the president had taken a very different approach to this from the beginning \u2014 invoked the Defense Production Act immediately to push manufacturing of PPE, test supplies, all of those things that were desperately needed early on so that we weren't competing in a global marketplace for those same products \u2014 that we would be in a very different place,\u201d said Jayapal.\n\nNow, even as many states begin the process of reopening their economies, Jayapal remains concerned about the U.S.\u2019s lagging response \u2014 and the double-standard she sees between the working conditions most Americans will face and the way the White House is approaching the virus when it comes to its own employees.\n\n\u201cWhile people want to get back to work \u2026 the reality is we're not ready yet,\u201d said Jayapal. \u201cWe don't have the extensive testing, contact tracing and isolation in place. And you look at the White House and Donald Trump \u2014 they're testing everybody. They're doing contact tracing and isolating. Well, if the White House is doing that for their folks, they should make sure that everybody in the country has that. And that is not the case right now.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, Jayapal spoke with POLITICO\u2019s Anna Palmer. What follows are excerpts of that interview, edited for length and readability. For more, listen to the interview on the newest episode of Women Rule .\n\nAnna Palmer: Before we get started on everything happening in Congress \u2014 and there's a lot to cover \u2014 I wanted to see if we could get a quick update on what's happening in your district, which is in the Seattle region and was one of the earliest hit by the coronavirus.\n\nRep. Pramila Jayapal: Our first case was the first case in the country, and it was diagnosed on January 21st. So, in many ways, our state has been at the forefront of leading the response, and a lot of other places have looked to us. We were able to flatten the curve significantly by restrictions early on. We just, however, passed our 1,000th fatality, and we are still struggling with all the things that many other states are struggling with. We have flattened the curve, but the problem is we're still seeing hundreds of cases every day and we don't have the testing/treatment/isolation capacity in place that we need to have even as we start to reopen slowly.\n\nFor my constituents, what I hear every day is they're devastated. They're incredibly anxious. There are a lot of frontline workers who are still working without safety. A lot of people who still have not received a stimulus check. Our employment system is, I think, excellent. But the reality is there are too many people on unemployment. And so the unemployment insurance system is creaking and groaning under the weight of just too much too quickly. There are a lot of people who still haven't received their unemployment claims, even though we are better than other states. So people are saying to me, 'I'm getting kicked out of my home, I haven't received my unemployment, the stimulus check is not enough, even if I have gotten it. And I don't know what I don't know how to think about life.' And that anxiety is palpable from the hundreds of calls I get every day.\n\nPalmer: There's spent a lot of criticism about the fits and starts of how this administration has approached not only in getting PPE, but testing and its advice for reopening the country. Yesterday, the president made a lot of news over the fact that he said he was taking an untested drug that a lot of experts have said is unsafe. He's still not wearing a mask. How impactful do you think it is that the president is kind of on a different page than a lot of his health experts and what a lot of the experts around the country are saying about how to approach this crisis?\n\nJayapal: It's enormous. This president has been intransigent about how he has approached this crisis, this pandemic. Everything from false information \u2014 whether it's about drugs, disinfectants, vaccines \u2014 you know, completely ignoring public health, railing on the CDC, which is our friend in this moment and needs all the backup possible.\n\nThere is no question in my mind that if the president had taken a very different approach to this from the beginning \u2014 invoked the Defense Production Act immediately to push manufacturing of PPE, test supplies, all of those things that were desperately needed early on so that we weren't competing in a global marketplace for those same products \u2014 that we would be in a very different place. We would have expanded testing significantly. We would have had the PPE for frontline workers. States would have followed the lead and guidance of the federal government, which is exactly what the federal government should be doing: providing the leadership and the guidance to states so that they know what they should be doing and how they should go about both shuttering their economies and reopening when safe. None of that has happened. None of that.\n\nIt has been incredibly frustrating to watch because states have sort of been left to play out \u201cThe Hunger Games\u201d on procuring swabs. I mean, literally, we have governors, my governor included, calling random people in China to try to get swabs off the back of a truck somewhere and get them here, only to find out then that perhaps they're not validated; they're not good for use. Same thing with PPE. I just think that the president has sort of come to this place where he's willing to sacrifice people's lives. And that's all that I see happening.\n\nSo the evaluation that has come from the Institute of Health Metrics, which is right here in my district \u2014 it's the evaluation models for fatalities that the White House touted early on. They have now increased their number of deaths, projected fatalities to a median of 132,000, I think it is, with a high of 233,000. So just imagine potentially looking at a quarter-million deaths. We have already long surpassed the [American death toll from the] Vietnam War. We may get to a place where we quickly surpass World War I deaths of American lives. And so I just think that this administration is intransigent and cruel in how its approached this pandemic.\n\nPalmer: There's been a ton of questions about whether the Capitol is prepared to safely reopen. Is that something you're concerned about? Have you taken any extra precautions just based on what you are seeing and best practices that maybe aren't being forced upon you, but that you want to take to keep people safe?\n\nJayapal: Yeah, absolutely. I mean, we have taken a lot of precautions. We're still telling everybody to telework, to work from home. I don't think we're safe yet to go back to work. And I think that that's true in the Capitol; it's true in workplaces across the country. At this point, it's not mandated that you wear a mask on the floor [of the House]. And there were mostly Republicans who were not wearing masks when they walked into the elevator, when they came onto the floor. The reality here is that while people want to get back to work and I think we should talk about why that is, because I think there are a few different reasons and some of them we can mitigate. The reality is we're not ready yet. We don't have the extensive testing, contact tracing and isolation in place. And you look at the White House and Donald Trump, you know, they're testing everybody. They're doing contact tracing and isolating. Well, if the White House is doing that for their folks, they should make sure that everybody in the country has that. And that is not the case right now. That is not the case in the Capitol, but it's also not the case in workplaces across the country. We're sending workers back when it's completely unsafe with no regard to their safety.\n\nPalmer: I want to take a step back a bit. You've been through a lot of firsts. You were the first Indian-American woman to serve in the U.S. House, the first woman to represent your district and the first Asian-American to represent Washington state in Congress \u2014\n\nJayapal: And the first person of color the Democrats have ever sent to Congress [from Washington state], actually.\n\nPalmer: Talk about that just in terms of the historic nature of all of those \u201cfirsts.\u201d Did you feel extra pressure?\n\nJayapal: I've always sort of been in that position. You know, I came to the United States when I was 16 by myself as an immigrant. My parents have never lived on the same continent as me since that time. And so, yes, there's always been real pressure to succeed, because when your parents make that kind of a sacrifice \u2014 and they were not wealthy, they had about $5,000 in their bank account; they used all of it to send me here \u2014 I think you do feel that additional pressure to always succeed. Mostly, that's a good thing. And sometimes, you know, it's a self-flagellating thing. But yes, I think I've often been in that situation: the only person of color, the only woman of color.\n\nI ran for the state Senate and served there for two years before coming to Congress. I was the only woman of color in the state Senate. And that's in what's thought of as a relatively liberal state. I take pride in that only because I think it provides a different way for other people to see their futures. Of course, I'm proud of it for myself. But the real benefit is that I never want to be the last. And so how do I use this opportunity to help change that dynamic for other people? And I think so many people tell me that they see their futures differently because I am here. And that, to me, is a source of great pride.\n\nPalmer: It must have been lonely, I imagine, in some cases to be kind of the first.\n\nJayapal: It is lonely, yes. It is lonely. But I think that a lot of leadership is lonely. If you are really providing true leadership, it often means that you're there before other people are there. I think that's true of some of the most important policies that I push.\n\nPalmer: Something that comes up in Women Rule conversations a lot is facing sexism in the workplace. You've talked about it in regards to Congress. Can you give us a little bit of the backstory there?\n\nJayapal: Yes, definitely. I definitely have to deal with it. For sure. As you know, it's it's sort of baked into our structures. You know, it's baked into the way people see us. But I think I think that, you know, you can't let that stop you. And the question is, really, do you engage with every incident of sexism or do you try to be a little bit more strategic? I pity the poor men who are so afraid of our talents as women, because most of the time it's because of their insecurity and not because of anything that we have done. You know, if only they could, you know, we could all be as big as we really are able to be without people feeling like they get small because we are big.\n\nPalmer: I want to talk to you about the Heroes Act, the $3 trillion bill House Democrats voted on last week. There's obviously been a lot of criticism about it from the more progressive wing that it didn't go far enough; criticism from moderates that taking the vote could hurt them in the election; Republicans just critical of the bill in general \u2014 that it wasn't a serious bill to go to war with next coronavirus relief package. You helped negotiate parts of that bill, but then voted against it. Can you kind of walk us through your thinking?\n\nJayapal: Absolutely. So a couple of things. One, it is absolutely urgent for us to respond. There is deep devastation. And Congress not acting is really not an option. So that's the first thing. The second thing is there were some good things in the package, and I'm grateful to the people who negotiated for those things \u2014 and some of them included things that were my priorities as well. But this takes me to my third point: I really believe that a proposal that originates in the Democratic House should have a very clear focus on the things that we can do that are really going to solve or make a huge impact in the crisis that's facing us, and that the scale has to be big enough. It's not the amount of money, by the way; I think the amount of money was fine; I could have spent more. The issue is what solutions are we offering? We needed a solution around jobs, recovering paychecks and putting money consistently in people's pockets and protecting small businesses.\n\nI had been pushing for my Paycheck Guarantee Act, which is now called the Paycheck Recovery Act. We just introduced it [on Tuesday morning] with 92 co-sponsors, including many, many moderates, because we Democrats should be the party of keeping workers in their jobs and not sending them off onto unemployment. If you do that, the second part of the solution is you can target the assistance that you need \u2014 whether it's rental assistance, stimulus checks, etc. \u2014 to the people who need it the most, because most people now hopefully will be getting paychecks and that will take care of rent, that will take care food on the table, that will provide some consistency for them and certainty around what they can do with their lives going forward. Then you target the other assistance to the people that need it the most.\n\nTo me, the package should have included solutions that would have ensured health care for everyone. And I'm not talking about Medicare for All; I'm talking about all kinds of other ways you can do that. And also would have ensured that people could keep their jobs and that we could end mass unemployment or at least dramatically reduce it. That's what most countries around the world have done. And that's certainly what the United States of America should do.\n\nWe now have 36 million Americans who have filed for unemployment in just the last eight weeks. And if we don't do something, we will be at 40 and 50 percent unemployment and it will be incredibly difficult for the economy to recover. And frankly, all of the structural inequities around race and gender will be so baked in, because those are the people that have the hardest time coming out of unemployment and finding a job because of the discrimination in the system. So I genuinely felt I couldn't vote for it.\n\nPalmer: There's been some likening of the progressive wing of the House Democrats to the Freedom Caucus, the conservative group of Republicans. The Freedom Caucus started to kill bills or stop legislative process in order to enact their will on the chamber. Is there a time in the future where you, as a leader of the progressives, feel like you are going to take more of those strong-arm tactics, or is that just not the style of politics that's within the Democratic Party?\n\nJayapal: I always resist comparisons to the Freedom Caucus, because I think the Freedom Caucus was a party of \"no\" and the Progressive Caucus as a party of \"yes.\" But is it true that we need to be willing to flex our muscles, if you will? I mean, we've done it a few times with some success. When Nancy Pelosi was being elected speaker of the House, we negotiated some very important things. Not everybody understands how important they were, but you wouldn't see Katie Porter on the Financial Services Committee or Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on the Financial Services Committee if we hadn't negotiated to get freshmen onto those committees and to get a certain number of progressives onto all of these committees. And so we have done that effectively. We did it around a budget fight, as well.\n\nI think that we just need to get a little bit more comfortable in two things. [One is] really being united around one specific ask. I don't think we do that very well because progressives care about a lot of things and so it becomes difficult to say, well, this is the one thing that if it's not in the bill, we won't vote for it. And I think the second issue is we do have to get comfortable with recognizing that power never concedes anything without a demand, as Frederick Douglass said. There is no reason to change the way things are if you don't actually give a challenge to it. And it doesn't mean that you're taking on leadership in a negative way. That's not how I think about it.\n\nI think of Nancy Pelosi as being a master negotiator, and she thinks in terms of her votes, she is incredibly hard working. She never sleeps. She's quite brilliant in any number of things, and one of them is the art of negotiation. She understands power very well; she used it on her own as a young legislator coming to Congress and standing up against leadership on AIDS funding. People have to understand that it isn't a slap in the face to leadership to take something on and to try to make it better; sometimes they may even be looking for that every once in a while, though, they'll never say it.\n\nTo hear more, listen to the full podcast episode here.

Andrew Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio deflected blame Thursday in the wake of a bombshell study confirming that New York\u2019s elected leaders stalled when it was time to take action on battling the spread of the coronavirus.\n\nAn analysis by Columbia University released Wednesday night concluded that if New York acted even one week earlier in ordering people to stay home and mandating social distancing, it would have spared more than 17,000 lives in the New York metro area.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe study evaluated how the entire country would have fared had it taken faster action and determined that roughly 36,000 fewer people would have died from the fast-spreading virus had people been forced to keep their distance from one another one week earlier in March.\n\nThe findings, first reported by The New York Times, revealed what many New Yorkers have come to believe over the past two months: Cuomo and de Blasio, two Democrats who have been unable to even present the same death count amid long-standing bickering, dragged their feet during the most dire crisis either has faced in their careers and as a result, thousands of New Yorkers died.\n\nBut both leaders on Thursday insisted they didn\u2019t know the extent or source of the spread, expressing regret for their ignorance but not the timing of their decisions.\n\nCuomo, who tends to dismiss retrospective analysis as \u201cMonday morning quarterbacking,\u201d has repeatedly referred questions about his responses to the data by which he says he makes his decisions.\n\nNo one reported that the virus was moving to Europe from China late last year, he said Thursday, and if the true extent of the spread was known, travel bans from both regions would have been appropriate as early as Dec. 31.\n\n\u201cWho should have known?,\u201d he told reporters at his briefing in Manhattan. \u201cIt\u2019s above my paygrade as the governor of one state, but what federal agency? What international health organization? I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s not what I do; it\u2019s not my responsibility. But someone has to answer that question.\u201d\n\nDe Blasio likewise placed blame on the novelty of the disease and the fact that no one had a playbook for its response.\n\n\u201cI wish we had known so much more in January, February, the beginning of March. I wish we had the testing that would have told us what was going on,\u201d de Blasio told reporters Thursday. \u201cIt\u2019s very painful to think about, if we had had the testing we needed, everything we could have done differently. Or if we had known then the things we know now, what we would have been able to do for people. It\u2019s horrible.\u201d\n\nThe first confirmed case of coronavirus was reported in the city on March 1, but experts now believe the virus was spreading in New York much earlier.\n\n\u201cAs we got information, we acted on it,\u201d de Blasio said Thursday. \u201cBut of course it\u2019s painful, and of course I look at that and I say, I wish we had known more, because we would have been able to do more.\u201d\n\nThe mayor said the findings would now inform a slow, cautious approach to easing restrictions in the city, which is expected to begin sometime in June.\n\n\u201cOur approach will be one that\u2019s cautious and careful and health and safety focused,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we\u2019re going to look at everything we can in terms of new research that tells us about what happened previously. It can inform our next steps.\u201d\n\nBut even when de Blasio and Cuomo were working off the same information, they struggled to coordinate a coherent response.\n\nThe mayor and governor delayed closing schools and nearly 80 city school employees have now died. De Blasio warned a shelter-in-place order would be needed after a lockdown was ordered in San Francisco and was derided by the governor, who said such orders cause unnecessary panic. Cuomo instituted one on March 22, albeit with a different name.\n\nDe Blasio declared schools would have to stay closed through the year \u2014 Cuomo said it was not the mayor\u2019s decision to make before ultimately closing schools for the year.\n\nExactly when de Blasio learned of the potential ravages of the virus is rooted in a tale of infighting between him and his public health department that triggered a near revolution among agency staffers. As of this week, he and his chosen health commissioner, Oxiris Barbot, seemed to have settled their feud, at least for the cameras, as she rejoined his daily press briefings after being iced out.\n\nBut behind the scenes the tension between de Blasio and the city's Department of Health and Mental Hygiene has been brewing for years and helps explain why New York was so delayed in enforcing safety measures, such as school and business closures, a shelter-in-place order and social distancing.\n\nIt was a recipe for disaster: A mayor who distrusts subject matter experts, an agency he felt created more political problems than it solved and a commissioner who was competing for his ear with the head of the city\u2019s public hospital system, Dr. Mitch Katz, who insisted in early March that closing schools was an overreaction.\n\nNew York on March 1 reported its first coronavirus case, a medical worker returning from Iran who was believed to have contracted the virus overseas. It is now widely believed that the novel virus was quietly spreading throughout the city earlier than that.\n\nNevertheless by March 6, the city had yet to figure out an action plan.\n\nCuomo had begun publicly discussing the virus\u2019 spread in New York in February, saying a positive case was not an \u201cif\u201d but \u201cwhen.\u201d But when the first cases were confirmed, his ensuing actions focused on minimizing panic, and emphasizing statistics that suggested the disease would largely spare the young and healthy; that 80 percent of those infected would easily recover at home.\n\nA stay-at-home order, he said as late as March 18, wasn\u2019t warranted. \u201cThe fear, the panic, is a bigger problem than the virus,\u201d he told The Daily podcast.\n\nDe Blasio first began seeking more testing capacity from the federal government as early as January, but he too downplayed the threat of the disease, encouraging New Yorkers to go to restaurants and use the subways in early March.\n\n\u201cFrom what we do understand, you cannot contract it through casual contact so the subway is not the issue,\u201d de Blasio said at the time.\n\nSince then, the virus has killed more than 23,000 people in New York, and the state, where more than 350,000 have tested positive, remains the national epicenter of the pandemic. On March 8, when the state had confirmed just 105 positive coronavirus cases and zero known deaths, Cuomo projected confidence in the experts tracking the virus and informing his decisions.\n\n\u201cThere is more fear, more anxiety, than the facts would justify,\u201d he said during his briefing then. \u201cThis is not the Ebola virus, this is not the SARS virus, this is a virus that we have a lot of information on.\u201d\n\nThat information has changed dramatically since then.\n\n\u201cThey keep changing the facts on us,\u201d Cuomo said Thursday.\n\nCORRECTION: Due to an editing error, a previous version of this story mischaracterized New York leaders' approach to school closures.", "link": "https://www.politico.com/states/new-york/city-hall/story/2020/05/21/cuomo-de-blasio-blame-ignorance-but-not-themselves-in-wake-of-damning-report-1285383", "published": "2020-05-21T00:00:00", "author": ["Anna Gronewold", "Sally Goldenberg", "Erin Durkin"]}, {"title": "Supreme Court stalls House access to entire Mueller report", "text": "In July, the Democratic-led House Judiciary Committee asked a judge for access to information the Justice Department withheld when it made most of Mueller\u2019s report public.

The decision also showed Trump\u2019s penchant for bucking the establishment \u2014 in this case, an alarmed medical community that has been skeptical about hydroxychloroquine\u2019s effectiveness in helping combat coronavirus.\n\n\u201cI think that most people kind of expected he was on this or some other kind of prophylactic from the beginning,\u201d said Jason Miller, a senior communications adviser for Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign and co-host of the podcast \u201cWar Room.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ve got people in the White House who have got it, he\u2019s shaking a number of hands, you look at someone like [British Prime Minister] Boris Johnson having it, and the fact that the president has been so healthy through this, people probably suspected he was on something.\u201d\n\nMany of the key questions about the president\u2019s use of hydroxychloroquine remained unanswered Tuesday: How much he\u2019s taking, how long he planned to take it and how it would interact with his existing heart medication. Trump's physician said only that he and the president had made the decision together.\n\nInstead, throughout the day, Trump simply defended his use of the drug, saying he believed hydroxychloroquine \u201cgives you an additional level of safety\u201d and \u201cdoesn\u2019t hurt people,\u201d and said \u201cpeople are going to have to make up their own mind\u201d regarding the drug\u2019s efficacy.

And there are only limited results from studies on whether hydroxychloroquine could be effective as a prophylactic measure. More extensive studies are currently in the works.\n\nStill, Trump has promoted the drug for weeks, encouraging Americans to take it. His proselytizing has led to a hydroxychloroquine shortage, which has had serious ramifications for people who have long used the drug to treat lupus, rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune diseases.", "link": "https://www.politico.com/news/2020/05/19/trumps-coronavirus-drug-white-house-reaction-269556", "published": "2020-05-19T00:00:00", "author": ["David Lim", "Zachary Brennan"]}, {"title": "How coronavirus is changing access to abortion", "text": "Since the outbreak, 94 percent of IPPF EN members responding to the survey \"reported a decrease in the number and frequency of services and outreach activities,\" according to the report.\n\nIt also takes to task governments, such as those in Poland and Romania, that have used the outbreak \"to undermine women\u2019s health and safety just when this most needs to be protected.\"\n\nThe EPF and IPPF EN are among the many groups calling on governments to recognize sexual and reproductive health care services as \"essential, life-saving and often time-sensitive services.\"\n\nAdvocates and practitioners stress the time-sensitive nature of abortion, whereby barriers can increase health risks either by necessitating surgical procedures or barring access altogether.\n\nOne key factor is that supply chain delays have affected operations, according to Chris Purdy, CEO of DKT International, a non-profit that operates in 60 countries outside Europe and distributes contraception and abortion services and technology.\n\n\u201cPretty much every single link of the supply chain is being affected by the strain connected to coronavirus,\" he said.\n\nDelays can start with manufacturers, who depend on raw material suppliers, as they experience \u201cslow-downs, shut-downs [and] closures of their factories\u201d due to the virus, he said. These suppliers would ordinarily be the providers of everything from active pharmaceutical ingredients to packaging, he added.\n\nThese delays continue as export opportunities shrink; quarantines of products on arrival lengthen; and internal supply chains are disrupted.\n\nUNFPA Supplies reported at the end of March that European \"suppliers are manufacturing at full capacity at this time, although they expect increased prices and challenges sourcing packaging and APIs [active pharmaceutical ingredients] if the crisis persists.\"\n\nThat report, which is the most recent accounting, also includes a projection for coming months.\n\n\"Mindful of anticipated challenges, suppliers are seeking 'free carrier' contract arrangements under which UNFPA would arrange transportation for deliveries in the third and fourth quarters of 2020,\" the report said.\n\nWhile supply issues in Europe don't look too dire for now, \u201cthere will be a greater demand for women who are interested in limiting, or controlling or terminating their pregnancies, because usually that's what happens at times of uncertainty,\u201d Purdy noted.\n\n\n\nIn a climate in which people are confined to their homes and apprehensive about visiting medical staff, difficulties in maintaining access to reproductive health care services and products extend beyond supply chains.\n\n\u201cYou're trying to move toward tele-health visits and really encouraging self-care as much as possible where that is feasible,\u201d said Daniel Grossman, an ob-gyn and professor at the University of California San Francisco.\n\n\"Contraception is one area ... where it would be safe and effective to make these methods available without a prescription,\" he said. \"This crisis is a good argument for expanding that kind of access, at least during the pandemic.\"\n\nIn March, France implemented temporary measures allowing women to use expired scripts to renew their oral contraceptive prescriptions. In neighboring Belgium, the government pushed ahead with existing plans to make the morning-after pill free, as well as other forms of contraception for those aged 18 to 25.\n\nThat measure \"will be key to continue ensuring access to contraception given the social and economic impact the crisis will have on women,\" the EPF and IPPF EN report said.\n\n\n\nBut the group also noted that its members in Albania, Austria, Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Denmark, Germany, Ireland, North Macedonia, Portugal and Spain \"have reported that they have been forced to scale back contraceptive care.\"\n\nReduced attendance at medical clinics \"due to fear of contracting Covid-19\" and hindered access to long-acting reversible contraception, such as contraceptive injections, implants or intrauterine devices, are among the barriers to reproductive health imposed by the pandemic, the report noted.\n\nTele-health is also a huge topic in the abortion sector.\n\nOn March 30, the British government introduced temporary measures that allow women to take abortion pills for early medical termination at home, provided that they follow a tele-health or physical consultation with a registered medical practitioner.\n\n\n\nPrior to that decision, the U.K. allowed medical abortions \u2014 which involve the administration of the drugs mifepristone and misoprostol, or surgical abortions \u2014 generally only up to 24 weeks of pregnancy.\n\nIreland has implemented similar provisions, allowing remote consultations in most cases for women seeking early medical abortions, while France has extended access to home medical abortions for women up to nine weeks pregnant, up from seven weeks as previously allowed.\n\nBy contrast, in the Netherlands, the Court of the Hague rejected an application to allow access to medical abortions without visiting an abortion clinic.\n\nMeanwhile, Germany, which requires mandatory counseling before abortions, has allowed this preliminary step to take place over the phone or by video, following pressure from pro-choice groups.\n\nBut Christiane von Rauch, a member of Doctors for Choice Germany, said this measure still leaves some access problems unaddressed, including shortages of personal protective gear in surgeries and clinics.\n\n\"Lack of PPE is a major issue cited by almost all respondents,\" agreed the EPF and IPPF EN report.\n\nThe immediate challenge aside, the lasting impact of Covid-19 on global access to abortions could be mixed, experts say.\n\n\u201cThe anti-abortion movement, at least in the U.S., is really trying to capitalize on the pandemic to essentially make abortion illegal in several states,\u201d Grossman said, referring to moves by Texas and some other Republican-governed states to issue bans on abortions during the outbreak on grounds they're non-essential medical procedures.\n\n\"They've used the restrictions on what kind of businesses can continue to operate to say that abortion services are not essential health care and services need to stop,\" he added.\n\nIn Europe, advocates continue to call on governments to improve access, raising particular concern around countries such as Poland, where restrictive abortion laws have been compounded by border closures \u2014 a major hurdle given that Polish women used to go to Slovakia or Germany for the procedure.\n\nNow, women are not just cut off from travel; they also can\u2019t count on Polish facilities, as they lack both doctors and necessary equipment.\n\nAnother country noted in the report is Romania, where the EPF and IPPF EN noted that \"the decision to suspend non-emergency procedures is in practice hindering women\u2019s reproductive freedom.\"\n\nIn response to criticism, Romanian Health Minister Nelu T\u0103taru has said he takes women\u2019s rights issues seriously and that each case had to be analyzed by the doctor, according to local media. It's not clear, however, if the situation has improved in the meantime, as the country continues to be under a state of emergency until May 14.\n\nOn the other side, the introduction of emergency measures means there's also a potential \"switch\" moment for reproductive health care in Western European countries such as the U.K., Purdy says.\n\n\"It's hard to roll that back once that door is open,\" he said. \"And if they allow it there, then you can imagine it might start to happen in other places.\"\n\n\"The advent of medical abortion [and] abortion pills is changing how women look at their options in a major way,\" he added. \"Keeping women fully informed of how those pills can be used is going to change a lot in the abortion space.\"\n\nCarmen Paun and Zosia Wanat contributed reporting.", "link": "https://www.politico.com/news/2020/05/21/how-coronavirus-is-changing-access-to-abortion-273193", "published": "2020-05-21T00:00:00", "author": []}, {"title": "NOAA sees busy hurricane season, as pandemic strains emergency services", "text": "If 2020 does meet that forecast, it would mark a new record of five consecutive above-normal Atlantic hurricane seasons, surpassing a previous record of four seasons during 1998 to 2001, Gerry Bell, the lead forecaster with the Climate Prediction Center, told reporters.\n\nNOAA's Climate Prediction Center predicted a 60 percent chance of an above-normal 2020 Atlantic hurricane season, with a 30 percent chance of a near-normal season.

It's advised communities to secure \"non-congregate\" shelters for evacuees, such as hotels and dormitories, and ensure search-and-rescue teams and volunteers have proper protective equipment to prevent the spread of Covid-19.\n\nCarlos Castillo, acting deputy administrator for resilience at FEMA, told reporters that the agency has responded to more than one large disaster at the same time before, such as in 2018, when the agency responded to two major hurricanes on the East Coast and wildfires in California.\n\n\"I want to reassure the nation that FEMA continues to take deliberate and proactive steps, working closely with our state, local, tribal, territorial, federal, nonprofit and private sector partners to safeguard our ability to respond and recover from future disasters that may arise during this pandemic,\" Castillo said.\n\nIn a hurricane preparation guidance released Wednesday, FEMA said it will \u201cgenerally minimize\u201d deployments to disaster-hit areas, an acknowledgment of both strained capacity and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines to limit unnecessary person-to-person contact to curb the coronavirus. Instead, FEMA will rely more on virtual coordination.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re in a situation where you\u2019ve got a declaration or where a storm has hit, yeah, we are looking at ways to scale back,\u201d FEMA spokesperson Lea Crager told POLITICO.\n\nSocial distancing measures also have complicated evacuation plans for areas that lie in a storm's path. FEMA has discouraged use of gymnasiums, arenas and convention centers that traditionally double as shelters. FEMA instead emphasized \u201cnon-congregate\u201d shelters such as hotels and dormitories, and suggested people consider staying home even under conditions like power outages.\n\nAs a result, overall shelter capacity will likely be diminished this year, Crager said, meaning communities will have to \u201cthink outside the box\u201d \u2014 though she acknowledged people might be afraid to go to shelters anyway given potential for viral infection. FEMA has tried to smooth the process for emergency planners by signaling to them early that it will reimburse a portion \u2014 typically at least 75 percent \u2014 of expenses for securing those types of non-congregate shelters.\n\nThe long-standing emergency plans that communities dust off every hurricane season tend to rely on massive shelters, so changing their procedures will present challenges, said Daniel Kaniewski, the former FEMA deputy administrator who left the agency in February.\n\n\u201cYou want to get this nailed down with as much advance notice as possible so states can plan based on that policy,\u201d said Kaniewski, who is now managing director at insurance firm Marsh & McLennan. \u201cHonestly, when these policies change, it takes a lot of coordination and planning and even exercising of that new policy. You can\u2019t just flip a switch.\u201d\n\nBut some towns don\u2019t have enough hotels or motels to meet local needs, said Colin Wellenkamp, executive director of the Mississippi River Cities and Towns Initiative, which works with local governments along the nation\u2019s largest river.\n\nEven coping with the simplest preparations that FEMA has outlined is a struggle, he said, and many local governments will struggle to pay for rooms even if they have them, or to cover the costs for personal protective equipment and acquire tests needed to handle potential evacuees.\n\n\u201cWhat cities are telling me is they don\u2019t have enough money right now to handle a pandemic and a major disaster at the same time,\u201d Wellenkamp said. \u201cWe\u2019ve spent so much money on the pandemic and our revenues have taken such a hit because of the closures and unemployment.\"\n\nEven if the federal government promises to reimburse localities, that \"doesn\u2019t help you if you don\u2019t have the cash to make the purchases in the first place,\u201d Wellenkamp added.\n\nThe twin pandemic and hurricane efforts are also stretching nonprofit organizations that help locate shelter sites, staff evacuation centers and bring in necessary supplies and food, said Gregory Forrester, CEO of National Voluntary Organizations Active in Disaster, a coalition of nonprofit groups.\n\nMany volunteers are elderly and will be vulnerable to Covid-19, he said, which, combined with the imperative to keep the virus from spreading to new areas, means trying to find additional local personnel without underlying medical conditions. Many nonprofits also haven\u2019t been able to fundraise for the hurricane season while they respond to the coronavirus.\n\n\u201cThe cost factors are higher but you plan for a certain degree and hope for the best,\u201d Forrester said. \u201cBut it\u2019s like any other hurricane season \u2014 nobody could have ever predicted a Harvey and Maria within six weeks of each other\u201d in 2017.", "link": "https://www.politico.com/news/2020/05/21/2020-hurricane-season-coronavirus-273508", "published": "2020-05-21T00:00:00", "author": []}, {"title": "Trump\u2019s reopening troubles play out in his White House", "text": "Publicly, Trump has not fully acknowledged how close the threat of the coronavirus came into the West Wing and his orbit.

The White House cases are a reminder we have to be diligent but you can continue to work safely by following health precautions,\u201d a third White House official said. \u201cWhile many were concerned the two positive cases in the West Wing would lead to an outbreak of many cases, the White House followed the Guidelines for Reopening American Again and were able to contain the cases with no additional positives.

How much worse will it get?", "text": "Here are some of the Q&As below, edited slightly for brevity and clarity.\n\nWhere do you think our current situation will rank among the Great Depression and the Great Recession?\n\nIn terms of depth, I think it will be as deep as even the Great Depression, way more than the Great Recession. But in my definition, the thing that makes it a depression is the collapse of the financial system and the extended/can't escape nature of it. And for that, a virus recession hopefully will not have to follow the normal rules and [the economy] can come back at least much of the way back much more quickly.\n\n\u2014 Austan Goolsbee, economist, professor and former chair of the Council of Economic Advisers.\n\nHow long will it take the U.S. economy to recover?\n\nIt's going to take some time to get back to under 10 percent unemployment. Like at least a few months. And perhaps longer. It took a decade to fully recover from the Great Recession of 2008-09 and we've essentially wiped out all those job gains in a matter of two months.\n\n\u2014 Ben White, chief economic correspondent and author of our \u201cMorning Money\u201d newsletter.\n\nWill an extended economic downturn spill over into housing markets? Or will the protections put in place after 2008 blunt the effects on housing prices?\n\nThe expectation would be that housing prices will go down \u2014 millions are out of work and the ones who could afford it don\u2019t want to do open houses or are hunkering down. A bigger question is whether there might be structural problems in the housing market. My colleague Katy O\u2019Donnell has written extensively about how the companies that collect mortgage payments are increasingly not banks and so they have a much more fragile business model (because they don\u2019t take deposits). That\u2019s been a concern because with some mortgage borrowers getting the ability to put off payments, those nonbank \u201cservicers\u201d are getting squeezed. If a bunch of those companies start to fail, it could cause a huge problem. Here\u2019s some context on that.\n\n\u2014 Victoria Guida, financial services reporter.\n\nWhy continue to tie health insurance to employment when a public health crisis exposes how precarious employment is?\n\nI think the pandemic and huge job losses will definitely make some people question the logic of tying health insurance to employment \u2014 and that will certainly help progressives and liberal leaders like Sen. Bernie Sanders argue health care should come from the government, not particular jobs. That said, I am still not sure the pandemic will result in the creation of a single-payer, government-run health care system (even if Joe Biden wins the election in November 2020). Not all Democrats are in favor of it, and there are powerful special interests in Washington who oppose the idea, pandemic or no pandemic.\n\n\u2014 Nancy Cook, White House reporter\n\nWhy does there seem to be little appetite among Senate Republicans for further stimulus, particularly when any boost to the economy would seemingly improve their chances of keeping the White House and Senate in November?\n\nSenate Republicans are worried that they have approved packages worth trillions of dollars in such a short period of time and are worried about continuing to spend \"like Democrats,\" as they would call it.\n\nThey want to slow walk the next stimulus package to see if it is necessary to continue to spend so much money, but they also want to make sure the next package includes things like no liability for companies who bring back workers who get sick. So part of the delay is to try to gain leverage over the Dems.\n\nThere is also disagreement among the two parties over the need to bail out state and local governments. If state tax revenue continues to decrease (as we've seen in places like California), then states will have to lay off workers \u2014 just as the Trump administration has basically left the coronavirus response to the states.\n\n\u2014 Nancy Cook, White House reporter.\n\nSome unemployment recipients are earning more on unemployment than they did working. Will this cause major incentive issues as employees are called back to work?\n\nThe extra UI payments are only short-lived and job vacancies are at unprecedented lows. The problem is that tens of millions of people lost their jobs (hopefully temporarily) and we wanted to send them relief. The argument that people are paid a replacement rate higher than what they earned before for a couple of months is a red herring. When employers are expanding, then we want to think about the hiring incentives, and yes, it would cause problems if we stayed at the levels we have now. In a moment of free fall, though, we need to get money to people quickly and this was a way to do it.\n\n\u2014 Austan Goolsbee, economist, professor and former chair of the Council of Economic Advisers.\n\nWhat are economists modeling in unemployment for the different tiers of the labor market?\n\nLayoffs so far have been concentrated among lower-paid workers; job losses have now hit 40 percent of low-income homes. And this summer, as Americans continue to hunker down, I expect we'll continue to see hurt in workers employed by the airlines and tourism industry.\n\nPeople who fared OK, so far, are white collar workers who can easily do their jobs from home. But if the economic downturn continues, I'd argue few people will be immune from the economic hardship. Law firms, lobbying shops, corporations will have a hard time keeping their business going indefinitely and at the same profit margins if everything remains pretty closed down and no vaccine seems imminent.\n\n\u2014 Nancy Cook, White House reporter.", "link": "https://www.politico.com/news/2020/05/21/coronavirus-economy-qa-273985", "published": "2020-05-21T00:00:00", "author": []}, {"title": "Colleges dump online SAT and ACT, fueling anti-testing movement", "text": "UC joins some 80 colleges and universities that have announced just this year they will not require standardized test scores this fall, either permanently or temporarily, as the testmakers prepare for online exams if high schools remain closed. Cornell University suspended its test requirement for fall 2021 and so have all public universities in Oregon, and colleges including Washington and Lee University, Davidson College, Fordham University, Vassar College and Tufts University. Altogether, more than 1,200 schools say applicants can skip the tests, including those who made the move before the pandemic.\n\nThe shift away from standardized tests has produced fierce pushback from the testmakers, who hold a multimillion-dollar dominance in the admissions process, and pleas to colleges to hang on to the exams. It means more colleges could base admissions on students' GPA, high school courses and personal essays, and ease what advocates see as longtime barriers for low-income and first-generation applicants. But the heads of the ACT and SAT warn an emphasis on GPAs could lead to grade inflation in well-to-do high schools, where parents can lobby teachers for better marks.\n\nTestmakers insist online exams will be secure, but colleges and counselors fear widespread cheating, a year after the \"Varsity Blues\" scandal revealed wealthy parents paid to boost their kids' scores. Technical glitches plagued some online Advanced Placement exams last week and parents and students have sued challenging the results.\n\nThe National Association for College Admissions Counseling has emerged as a prominent critic of the push for online ACT and SAT tests. \u201cIt was the last straw,\u201d said Jayne Fonash, president of the group of counselors who advise college applicants.\n\n\u201cMany of us have had concerns about this testing for a long time, but we don't seem to be making any progress,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat precipitated doing this right now, is it was another example of students being disadvantaged in access to higher education.\u201d Counselors are worried about students without high-speed internet access at home trying to take the tests, and how to make the tests available for students with disabilities.\n\nFonash said her organization has encouraged college officials who are among its more than 15,000 members to reassess their admission criteria for students applying for the 2020-21 academic year, especially standardized test scores. The counselors' group says it felt \u201cblindsided\u201d by the testmakers\u2019 decisions this spring to put the tests online and charged that details regarding security, content, scoring or validity have not been adequately addressed.\n\nCheating is also a potential issue, and could be exacerbated by the online at-home exams. A 2019 POLITICO review found that the College Board and ACT have virtually no oversight of many individuals proctoring the exams.\n\nBefore the coronavirus upended the traditional college admissions process that includes deadlines and standardized tests, institutions had long stayed faithful in using the SAT and ACT as indicators of first-year college success. Their trust continued despite bruises inflicted by the admissions scandal and a civil rights lawsuit filed against the UC system over its use of the exams in admissions decisions.\n\nThe College Board, which administers the SAT and AP, brings in more than $1 billion a year in revenue, according to 2018 tax documents. The ACT, founded in 1959, brought in about $349 million that year.\n\nBoth The College Board and ACT dispute that the digital delivery of the exams is a new, untested concept. The ACT has offered online exams overseas for prospective international students, and had planned to further roll out online testing in the U.S. this year.\n\nThe testmakers say they are moving the tests online as a way to ensure students have access to the high stakes admissions exams. They also say they\u2019ve been working with colleges and have been relying on their guidance during the development of the new options.\n\n\u201cWe would much prefer the schools reopened,\u201d College Board CEO David Coleman said on a call with reporters. \u201cBut we are ready to innovate and deliver in the unlikely case we need to.\u201d\n\nThe testmakers resist the possibility of cheating and College Board President Jeremy Singer described what the remote proctoring for the SAT could look like when a student sits in front of a computer to take the exam.\n\n\u201cThe software locks down everything else on their computer so they can't open any other program, other than the proctoring software which would also have the testing software,\u201d Singer told reporters. \u201cThen their camera and microphone are on, so you can detect any movement in the room. There's all these mechanisms, and again, I think has been quite standard.\u201d\n\nThe ACT said in a statement that it respects colleges' decisions on their admissions policies, especially in the middle of a crisis, but defended the test's value as consistent across districts and states, and predictive of a student's college success.\n\nIf exams are de-emphasized, grade inflation will ensue, \"particularly in wealthy districts and private schools where college counselors are provided, custom learning resources are offered, and assertive parents are willing to negotiate with teachers,\" Marten Roorda, the head of the ACT, wrote in a letter to the University of California system.\n\nBut if the Advanced Placement exams taken last week by high school students for college credit are any indication of what fall online testing could look like, it\u2019s fair to say online ACTs and SATs will not go off without a hitch.\n\nBrittanie Davis, a counselor at Kokomo High School in Indiana, said some of her students faced technical glitches while trying to submit their AP exams, and the experience shook their confidence for the rest of the exam period, let alone the SAT or ACT in the fall.\n\n\u201cThey've never seen the new format, they don't know what it's like,\u201d Davis said. \u201cTo ask them at the beginning of their senior year \u2014 when they're supposed to be submitting their college applications \u2014 to try to take a test online with technology that is new to them and a test that is new to them when they already have access issues is really concerning.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe thing about moving tests online is that it should be an option,\" Davis said, \"not the only choice.\u201d\n\nThe College Board has said about 3.4 million students are registered to take AP Exams this year, and that less than 1 percent of the first more than 1 million students who tested encountered technical difficulties. But students along with test opponents are suing The College Board, claiming it rolled out the \u201cuntested\u201d online exams to pad its pockets amid hundreds of thousands canceled spring SAT administrations. Peter Schwartz, College Board chief risk officer and general counsel, called the suit \"wrong factually and baseless legally.\"\n\nAs for this fall, the testmakers have tried to assure colleges that the online tests will be \"secure and fair; accessible to all; and valid for use in college admissions,\u201d according to The College Board.\n\n\u201cThe facts are that we've been working with digital testing on the SAT for approximately five years,\u201d Coleman said. \u201cSo, as a question of science and psychometric validity, we can absolutely do an apples-to-apples comparison between the at home test, and the digital test and those taken within a school.\u201d\n\nYet colleges remain skeptical and that has encouraged longtime test opponents.\n\n\u201cThis cancellation of tests this spring and all the other disruptions in the admissions process has been a catalyst for more schools to go test-optional,\u201d said Bob Schaeffer, interim executive director at FairTest: National Center for Fair & Open Testing, which has led the test-optional admissions movement since the late 1980s.\n\nPOLITICO NEWSLETTERS Morning Education A daily dose of education policy news \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox.

Others are doing away with the requirement indefinitely. \u201cWhat we've seen is that once schools go test-optional, they very rarely go back to requiring tests,\" Schaeffer said.\n\nClaremont McKenna College in California is one institution that has said it would not use scores from the fall tests as a replacement for the traditional SAT or ACT exams. \"Although both the College Board and the ACT have introduced the concept of an at-home version of the exams, details regarding security, content, scoring, or validity have not been addressed,\" the college said in a statement.\n\nFonash said there's just not been enough preparation for an online shift. \u201cThere are several layers of not only inequity, but lack of information to make decisions about counseling students or awarding credits to students,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIt's no one's fault that the test could not be administered in person this year,\u201d she added. \u201cBut their solution was to roll out an online platform without significant beta testing, significant input from stakeholders or some conversations from professional groups about a plan. There could have been a much more responsible way to look at this.\u201d\n\nThe UC system made its decision after President Janet Napolitano advocated to push testing requirements off until 2024 and asked her Board of Regents to create a new admissions exam for California students. The regents cited the coronavirus upheaval as an opportunity to implement the new policy.\n\nThe change didn't come easily, though. Earlier this year, the UC faculty task force recommended the system should retain its SAT or ACT admissions requirement, despite pressure to get rid of it.\n\nMany have viewed this as a potential turning point for whether standardized tests will continue to play a role in admissions, saying if the UC, one of the largest public university systems in the country, decides to go test-optional, more will follow suit.\n\n\"Regardless of what happens with such policies, our mission remains the same: to give all students, and especially low-income and first generation students, opportunities to show their strength,\" The College Board said in a statement. \"We must also address the disparities in coursework and classrooms that the evidence shows most drive inequity in California.\"\n\nYet even test opponents admit that while the coronavirus may have thrown some punches with the sudden upheaval of the school year, it won\u2019t be the complete end of the test, Schaeffer said.\n\n\u201cThere will always be a few schools for whatever reason that will continue having testing requirements \u2014 both hyper selective institutions, like the Ivy Leagues and many public universities,\u201d he said. \u201cFairTest is about giving kids choices, not telling them what they have to do or not.\u201d", "link": "https://www.politico.com/news/2020/05/21/colleges-dump-online-sat-and-act-fueling-anti-testing-movement-274284", "published": "2020-05-21T00:00:00", "author": ["Bianca Quilantan"]}, {"title": "McConnell's GOP takes Trump's election-year cues", "text": "It\u2019s all part of the last stage of the GOP\u2019s evolution during Trump\u2019s first term: an apparent end to public disagreements for the next six months until the party is past the election.\n\n\u201cI just think that everybody realizes that our fortunes sort of rise or fall together,\u201d said Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.), the party whip. \u201cOne thing we have to do is to make sure that we are united on our agenda and make sure that there\u2019s not separation between the White House and Republicans in Congress.\u201d\n\nTwo hours after McConnell\u2019s floor speech, Senate Republicans hosted Trump for their first party lunch in two months. The gathering was largely an opportunity for the president to present poll numbers, talk about his re-election campaign and tout his handling of the coronavirus crisis, which has ravaged the economy and infected more than a million people.\n\nBut Trump also urged Republicans to stick together as the election approaches \u2014 and act a little bit more like the opposition party he loathes.\n\n\u201cHe very frequently reminds us that we\u2019re not as tough as [Democrats] are, that they play more for keeps, that they stick together better,\u201d said Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.). \u201cPart of what makes us conservative is our independence, so that is our strength philosophically but sometimes it can be a weakness.\u201d\n\nThere was no real agenda for the meeting, but the takeaway was clear to attendees. Trump told senators that \u201cwe need to be a team,\u201d said Sen. Jerry Moran (R-Kan.). When asked whether Trump encouraged senators to hammer home on the investigative front, Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) replied: \u201cHe didn\u2019t need to.\u201d\n\nThe moment reflected a new level of political synergy between Trump and the Senate Republicans who once blanched at his Twitter insults, his erratic governing style and his unorthodox economic, immigration and diplomatic policies. These days the Senate GOP majority has become an extended arm of Trumpism, with occasional complaints by a scattered few senators but mostly toothless dissent.\n\nTrump has been on a tear as he seeks retribution against his political enemies, whether it\u2019s on the origins of the Russia investigation, the FBI\u2019s case against former national security adviser Michael Flynn, or Hunter Biden\u2019s Ukraine work \u2014 and Republicans seem eager to play along. McConnell is defending his majority this fall in increasingly difficult conditions, and the GOP has decided the only way to win is to stick by Trump as closely as possible.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not crazy or a conspiracy theorist if you see a pattern of institutional unfairness toward this president,\u201d McConnell said earlier on Tuesday. \u201cYou would have to be blind not to see one.\u201d\n\nMcConnell also used his floor remarks to take a rare public jab at a federal judge for trying to slow the Justice Department\u2019s move to drop the case against Flynn.\n\nWhen asked whether he spoke with Trump after the president issued a direct appeal to him on Twitter over the weekend, McConnell sidestepped the question and said that Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) will have \u201call control on reviewing\u201d the 2016-era investigations. \u201cHe has a pretty expansive plan to look into all of that,\u201d McConnell added.\n\nTrump did not directly answer a reporter over whether he was satisfied with how Republican senators were handling the matter. Instead, he reiterated his litany of grievances against the Obama administration.\n\nPresident Donald Trump speaks with reporters after meeting with Senate Republicans at their weekly luncheon on Capitol Hill. | AP Photo/Patrick Semansky\n\nSince Friday, Trump fired the State Department\u2019s inspector general, went after McConnell on Twitter and revealed he was taking hydroxychloroquine, an anti-malarial drug with uncertain benefits for coronavirus according to officials. Meanwhile the U.S. death toll for the pandemic has shot past 90,000 and the unemployment rate is spiking.\n\nRepublicans have largely shrugged at Trump\u2019s self-medication and defended his coronavirus response. They\u2019ve also largely backed down as Trump continues his purge of government watchdogs in the aftermath of his acquittal in the Senate\u2019s impeachment trial, sending stern letters to Trump that have been ignored so far.\n\nAnd when they had the president in front of him on Tuesday, senators decided it was not the venue to demand the explanation for the ousted inspectors general that they say they want.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t ask him about it because I\u2019m tracking down my own questions and trying to be able to work through the process,\u201d said Sen. James Lankford (R-Okla.). \u201cI\u2019ve already started my own follow-up, privately.\u201d\n\nAt the beginning of 2019, Republicans grimaced at Trump\u2019s government shutdown and a bipartisan majority voted against his national emergency to build a border wall. GOP senators decried Trump\u2019s tariffs for years and even conceded some tweets targeting progressive women in the House were racist.\n\nBut after everyone except Utah Sen. Mitt Romney banded around Trump during the impeachment trial, the party turned the page.\n\n\u201cThe impeachment thing clearly brought people together,\u201d said Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.).\n\nAnd Republicans are about to dig in even further behind Trump. On Wednesday, the Senate Homeland Security Committee will vote on a subpoena as part of the panel\u2019s GOP-run investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s son, Hunter.\n\nAfter Graham rebuffed Trump\u2019s calls for the Judiciary Committee to haul in President Barack Obama and question him about the Flynn case, Graham now plans to approve a broad subpoena to compel documents and testimony from a slew of former Obama administration officials.\n\nGraham told reporters he hoped to have his report out before the election and insisted that the subpoenas had nothing to do with Trump\u2019s calls for him to call in Obama.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been planning this for a long time,\u201d Graham said.\n\nLike Graham, McConnell had declined to endorse Trump\u2019s push to haul Obama and Biden before the Senate, saying only in a Fox News interview last week that the public deserves to know more about how the 2016-era probes began. That response set off a flurry of criticism from Trump's allies in the conservative media, which led to Trump\u2019s direct appeal to McConnell on Saturday to \u201cget tough and move quickly.\u201d\n\nThe new subpoena action also comes a week after two key Republicans senators released a list of Obama administration officials who might have been involved in efforts that \u201cunmasked\u201d Flynn, who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI but whose criminal case was dropped earlier this month. Biden\u2019s name was on the list, which was compiled by Acting Director of National Intelligence Richard Grenell.\n\nThese efforts by Republican senators are likely to give Trump a boost with his political base. The president\u2019s reelection campaign unleashed a torrent of criticism against Biden after the \u201cunmasking\u201d list was released.\n\nPOLITICO NEWSLETTERS Huddle A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.

Mike Braun (R-Ind.) has said he wants his party to multi-task and also make headway on climate change policy and health care.

They were interspersed throughout frequent life updates that included pictures of Howze and his family celebrating holidays and attending sporting events.\n\nIn the recently uncovered posts, Howze accused the Clintons of leaving \u201ca trail of bodies as long as the Mississippi River behind them.\u201d He compared recipients of the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program to pedophiles: \u201cSurely they understand that pedophiles are \u2018dreamers\u2019 too.\u201d Addressing the Black Lives Matter movement in a post, he wrote: \u201cAs a culture 95% percent of you vote in lock step for the same political party who held you as physical slaves and now wish to keep you as political slaves unable to effect any real change for the better.\u201d\n\nHe also asserted that Muslims cannot be good American citizens, and in a Facebook post signed \"Ted Howze American citizen,\" he said the 2016 mass shooting at Orlando\u2019s Pulse nightclub occurred because \"the FBI was ordered by the Obama administration to lay off Muslims.\u201d\n\nThe Howze campaign declined to comment when provided screenshots of the posts. \"It's the policy of the campaign to not comment on fake news or redundant stories by the same insider online blog,\u201d the campaign said in a statement.\n\nHowze, a large-animal veterinarian and former Turlock city councilman, won a March primary to challenge freshman Democratic Rep. Josh Harder in a northern Central Valley battleground that Democrats flipped in 2018. House Republicans need to net 17 seats to reclaim the majority.\n\nClinton narrowly won the district in 2016, and Harder ousted Republican Rep. Jeff Denham by 5 points two years later. It is not currently in the top tier of the GOP\u2019s 2020 targets, but some party operatives believe it could become competitive later on, particularly if Howze decides to self-fund in the general election as he did in the primary.\n\nHowze is in the second tier of the NRCC\u2019s \u201cYoung Guns\u201d program for promising House campaigns.\n\nWhen presented earlier this month with similar writings from his account that pushed conspiracy theories and belittled Muslims and immigrants, Howze claimed he was not the author. He suggested that other people had obtained his password, and that when he discovered this he had blocked their access.\n\nBut he would not elaborate on who posted on his account and why the posts remained publicly accessible until shortly before he launched a 2018 campaign for the same seat.\n\nA review of posts on his personal Facebook account conducted by POLITICO found a trove of comments disparaging Islam throughout 2016. Howze largely presented these comments as own words \u2014 without citations or quotations \u2014 but some appear to have been copied from other internet sources.\n\nOn June 16, 2016, he shared a meme of a gun salesman addressing an unseen customer. The text overlaying the photo suggested breaking an Islamic dietary law should be a litmus test for purchasing it: \u201cYes sir, your background check came back fine. But I gotta see you eat some bacon or its no sale!\u201d\n\nOn June 18, 2016, he said President Barack Obama should be arrested for treason because he \"puts the welfare of foreign Muslims ahead [of] his own citizens.\" He signed this post.\n\nThree days later, he wrote that Sharia law \u201cDiscriminates against and punishes women regularly! Puts gay & lesbian people to death without remorse! Routinely beats, jails and murders Christians!\u201d\n\nIn September 2016, he speculated on why Obama was admitting more \"muslim 'refugees'\u201d: \u201cCould it be because Obama's father is Muslim? Or that his step father Lolo Soetoro is Muslim? Could it be that during his time living in Indonesia, which doesn't allow dual citizenships, that Obama's school records identify him as Barry Soetoro, an Indonesian citizen of Muslim faith!\u201d\n\nOne day later, he posed \u201ca question of the day\u201d on his Facebook account: \"Can a Muslim ever truly be a good American citizen?\"\n\nThe answer, Howze wrote, was no. Among his reasoning in his 318-word post: Socially, a Muslim's \u201callegiance to Islam forbids him to make friends with Christians or Jews\"; Domestically, a Muslim is \u201cinstructed to marry four Women and beat his wife when she disobeys him\"; and, spiritually, \u201cwhen Americans declare ourselves \u2018one nation under God.\u2019 we are referring to the Christian\u2019s God and not Allah.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Western world and Christian Nations,\u201d he concludes, \u201cshould all be very suspicious of ALL MUSLIMS!\u201d\n\nNeither the NRCC nor McCarthy disavowed Howze when POLITICO first reported the language on his social media accounts, a silence on which Democrats have seized. McCarthy's office and the NRCC did not respond to requests for comment on Tuesday evening.\n\n\u201cHouse Republicans, including Minority Leader McCarthy, who have lined up behind Howze should have to answer for his racist rhetoric and hateful bigotry,\u201d DCCC spokesperson Andy Orellana said in a statement. \u201cIf Howze is the type of candidate the NRCC is touting as their path to the majority, I\u2019m confident they\u2019ll fall woefully short.\u201d", "link": "https://www.politico.com/news/2020/05/20/howze-social-media-muslims-dreamers-270469", "published": "2020-05-20T00:00:00", "author": []}, {"title": "Warner asks intel chief to fork over underlying 'unmasking' intel on Michael Flynn", "text": "As the committee\u2019s top Democrat, Warner has no power to compel Grenell to comply. It\u2019s not clear whether Republicans will endorse any aspects of Warner\u2019s request, though the Senate intel panel has operated on a more bipartisan basis than its more raucous House counterpart. The incoming chairman, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), recently replaced Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.), who stepped aside amid a probe of his financial dealings.\n\nCritics have seized on the declassified list, which includes former Vice President Joe Biden, as evidence that Flynn was spied on by the Obama administration, which picked up Flynn speaking with the former Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak during routine surveillance of foreign officials. Flynn suggested in the calls that the sanctions imposed by the Obama administration to punish Russian election interference might be overturned by Trump and urged the Russians not to retaliate, FBI officials have said.\n\nMichael Flynn. | Manuel Balce Ceneta/AP Photo\n\nBut the declassified list, which was provided by the National Security Agency, appears to have nothing to do with the Flynn-Kislyak calls, which were discovered by the FBI. According to The Washington Post, Flynn\u2019s name was not masked \u2014 or \u201cminimized,\u201d in FBI parlance \u2014 in those records.\n\nNational security experts and former officials have also noted that the \u201cunmaskers\u201d wouldn\u2019t have known whom they were trying to get more information about \u2014 and that the frequency with which Flynn\u2019s name showed up in intercepted calls with foreign officials before entering the administration, and the corresponding swell of unmasking requests, is evidence only that the Obama administration was alarmed by the content of the conversations and sought to find out more.\n\n\u201cThere are thousands of such requests each year, each subject to the same process before it is approved,\u201d Warner wrote of unmasking requests, noting that under the Trump administration the number of unmasked identities jumped from 9,529 in 2017 to 16,721 in 2018.\n\nGrenell has been on a declassification tear in recent days as he prepares to hand the office over to his successor. In the past week he has declassified not only the list of Obama administration officials involved in the unmasking, but also an email that former national security adviser Susan Rice sent herself in January 2017 memorializing a meeting with Obama, former FBI Director James Comey and others in which concerns were expressed over Flynn\u2019s calls with Kisylak.\n\nNow, Warner is asking that Grenell \u201cdeclassify and make publicly available any intelligence report concerning conversations between Lt. Gen. Flynn (ret.) and Russian Ambassador to the United States, Sergey Kislyak,\u201d in order \u201cto more fully and properly inform the American people of the events surrounding the unmasking of\u201d Flynn.\n\n\u201cThese calls have been the topic of the multiple investigations, trials, and plea agreements concerning General Flynn and merit being in the public domain,\u201d Warner wrote, citing a 2009 executive order governing classified national security information that calls for information to be declassified \u201cin some exceptional cases, [where] the need to protect such information may be outweighed by the public interest in disclosure of the information.\u201d\n\nGrenell is on the verge of being replaced by Rep. John Ratcliffe (R-Texas), who was just cleared as the permanent director of national intelligence by the Senate Intelligence Committee and is expected to pass the final hurdle \u2014 a full Senate vote \u2014 later this week.\n\nBut pressure is mounting on the Office of the Director of National Intelligence to declassify more information about the Flynn-Kislyak calls, including the transcripts of the calls themselves. The Justice Department recently moved to dismiss the case against Flynn, who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about the content of those calls in January 2017.\n\nOn Tuesday, Rice also called for the DNI to release the unredacted transcripts.\n\n\u201cIn the interest of transparency, Ambassador Rice again calls upon the Director of National Intelligence to release the unredacted transcripts of all Kislyak-Flynn calls,\u201d Rice\u2019s spokesperson said in a statement. \u201cThe American people deserve the full transcripts so they can judge for themselves Michael Flynn\u2019s conduct.\u201d\n\nAndrew Desiderio contributed to this report.", "link": "https://www.politico.com/news/2020/05/20/warner-michael-flynn-271354", "published": "2020-05-20T00:00:00", "author": []}, {"title": "Reopening tension pits state, local officials against each other in sign of what\u2019s to come", "text": "POLITICO Dispatch: May 20 Schools will look very different when the doors open again. The CDC releases detailed reopening guidance. McConnell cries foul on the Michael Flynn case.\n\nTension that began with governors versus the federal government has now trickled down, pitting officials within their own states against each other in ways that have direct implications for the fight against the virus and have already landed in the courts. Future disputes could complicate plans to respond to a resurgence, tie up urgent policy issues in legal wrangling and even risk lives.\n\nWith cases increasing in some places and falling in others \u2014 and with a second wave predicted in the fall \u2014 the new pandemic battlegrounds will be increasingly localized.\n\n\u201cCities can't wait for the federal and state government for guidance,\u201d said Charleston Mayor Amy Shuler Goodwin, who has continued to clash with West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice, including last week over his decision to add tanning beds to the list of essential businesses. \u201cThere is not one single mayor that doesn't want all the lights back on and all the doors back open, but we need to be really careful about doing that.\u201d\n\nExperts say a one-size-fits-all approach for reopening is not an option \u2014 not when the number of new daily cases is changing at vastly different rates from city to city and state to state. Across many states that have started to reopen, governors have indeed prescribed economic restart plans based on regional metrics, not statewide figures. As that continues \u2014 and if the virus resurges \u2014 there could be even more openings for such disagreements.\n\n\u201cWe have to be making decisions that are hyper local. This is not one big epidemic, it\u2019s multiple, small epidemics,\u201c said Caroline Buckee, an epidemiologist at Harvard University, during a Brookings Institution discussion on reopening plans. \u201cAnd the decisions we make have to reflect the inequalities in the location in question and how reopening is going to impact the relationships between different neighborhoods.\u201d\n\nIn California, Gov. Gavin Newsom has faced backlash from coastal mayors over cracking down on beach use, and the Democratic governor has allowed more than 20 of the state's 58 counties to move faster than his original plan in the face of increasing pressure \u2014 and lawsuits \u2014 from those anxious to reopen.\n\nThings escalated in Texas last week after Attorney General Ken Paxton sent letters to counties that include metropolitan hubs Dallas, Austin and San Antonio, chastising them for stricter local requirements on masks and mass gatherings that conflict with state efforts to loosen restrictions.\n\n\u201cInsofar as your order conflicts with the governor\u2019s order, it is unenforceable,\u201d Paxton\u2019s office said in a letter to Dallas County\u2019s top executive, Judge Clay Jenkins.\n\nRepublican Gov. Greg Abbott and other Texas officials have repeatedly clashed with the state\u2019s large Democratic-controlled cities and counties since the start of the pandemic and continue to do so, even as the death toll continues to grow.\n\n\u201cWe never dreamed that the governor was not serious about wanting people to follow his guidelines,\u201d Jenkins said in an interview. \u201cThey didn\u2019t give me a heads up on any concerns before this letter, but that\u2019s the political nature of how things are running in Austin.\u201d\n\nIn West Virginia, the dissonance between the governor and the mayor of the state\u2019s largest city has been clear for some time, with Charleston declaring a state of emergency and activating its emergency operations center before the rest of the state did.\n\nShuler Goodwin, the mayor, said she has talked with mayors across the country facing the same disconnect who have felt like they\u2019ve had to take matters into their own hands. On some issues, she said, it\u2019s obvious where to draw the line.\n\n\u201cDo I think tanning beds are essential services? No. Of course I don't,\u201d Shuler Goodwin said.\n\nIn Iowa, Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds made big moves to reopen her state last week, greenlighting salons, barbershops, tattoo and massage businesses. Her latest proclamation also extends partial reopenings of restaurants, libraries and fitness centers.\n\nReynolds had already eased restrictions in some counties, saying she \u201cshouldn\u2019t punish\u201d the majority of the state because of high infection rates in certain areas. But as she was pushing people forward last week, Sioux City Mayor Bob Scott was urging his residents to remain cautious.\n\n\u201cI think a lot of our citizens realize that there's still a potential to have this thing expand \u2026 at this stage, it becomes an individual choice,\u201d Scott said. \u201cI know personally I'm not going to run right out and go shopping or do that type of activity.\u201d\n\nScott said he\u2019s had conversations with Reynolds about his concerns, and that she\u2019s \u201cvery open\u201d to discussions, but \u201cI'm not sure I'll change her mind on anything.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s still the governor,\u201d he said.\n\nPublic officials aren\u2019t the only ones showing discontent with state responses. A POLITICO/Morning Consult poll conducted last week found a third of Americans rated their governor\u2018s handling of the virus either \u201cjust fair\u201c or \u201cpoor.\u201d\n\nAs the virus slows its spread, and the public grows more antsy, partisan divisions could further shape the public health debate about the pandemic \u2014 and the debate about local politics.\n\n\u201cThe pointy end of the stick here, the leading edge of reopening, is going to be at the county level and in the cities,\u201d said David McCuan, an American politics professor at Sonoma State University in California who has been closely watching these disputes. \u201cCounty supervisors, mayors and those local politicians are going to be the ones really deciding what reopening looks like. They\u2019re going to be much more responsive to the sentiment of the population.\u201d\n\nMcCuan predicts a wave of recall elections from voters dissatisfied with how their local officials handled the pandemic.\n\n\u201cThe easy part for politicians is over,\u201d he said. \u201cThe next stage of this thing is a free for all.\u201d\n\nRenuka Rayasam contributed to this report.", "link": "https://www.politico.com/states/california/story/2020/05/20/reopening-tension-pits-state-local-officials-against-each-other-in-sign-of-whats-to-come-1284317", "published": "2020-05-20T00:00:00", "author": ["Mackenzie Mays", "Myah Ward"]}, {"title": "What good are national polls if that's not how we pick presidents?", "text": "", "link": "https://www.politico.com/video/2020/05/20/national-polls-president-2020-trump-biden-075949", "published": "2020-05-20T00:00:00", "author": ["Eugene Daniels"]}, {"title": "PUNCHLINES: TikTokers, comedians and cartoonists roast Trump's use of hydroxychloroquine", "text": "", "link": "https://www.politico.com/video/2020/05/21/punchlines-tiktokers-comedians-and-cartoonists-roast-trumps-use-of-hydroxychloroquine-075965", "published": "2020-05-21T00:00:00", "author": ["Matt Wuerker"]}, {"title": "Hydroxychloroquine, Debit Cards and other highlights from the White House Cabinet meeting", "text": "", "link": "https://www.politico.com/video/2020/05/19/hydroxychloroquine-debit-cards-and-other-highlights-from-the-white-house-cabinet-meeting-075832", "published": "2020-05-19T00:00:00", "author": []}, {"title": "Whitmer responds to Trump's tweets on mail-in ballots", "text": "", "link": "https://www.politico.com/video/2020/05/20/whitmer-responds-to-trumps-tweets-on-mail-in-ballots-075891", "published": "2020-05-20T00:00:00", "author": []}, {"title": "How I got my first pandemic haircut", "text": "", "link": "https://www.politico.com/video/2020/05/15/how-i-got-my-first-pandemic-haircut-075599", "published": "2020-05-15T00:00:00", "author": ["Renuka Rayasam"]}, {"title": "May 2020", "text": "May 2020\n\nPolitical cartoons from the desk of Matt Wuerker.", "link": "https://www.politico.com/gallery/2020/05/04/matt-wuerker-cartoons-may-2020-003696", "published": "2020-05-04T00:00:00", "author": ["Matt Wuerker"]}, {"title": "Trump tries on MAGA 2.0 for a pandemic era", "text": "Trump aides and allies have told the president privately he has no choice but to focus his campaign on rebuilding the economy, according to three people familiar with the discussions.\n\nThe president\u2019s political advisers also say there\u2019s reason to believe it\u2019s a winning message. Recent campaign and public polling show Trump slightly outperforming likely Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden on handling of the economy even as the president finds himself on shaky ground nationally and in battleground states less than six months before the election. On a conference call last week with surrogates, the Trump campaign cited new internal polling that showed Trump with a 15-percentage point advantage over Biden on the economy in 17 states the campaign is targeting in November, according to a person familiar with the call.\n\n\u201cThe one issue Trump really clobbers Biden on is the economy, and so he\u2019s got to stick with that message,\u201d said Stephen Moore, a conservative economist who serves as an outside adviser to Trump. \u201cHe has to persuade people that his policies will work to get American businesses and jobs back.\u201d\n\nBut Make America Great Again 2.0 may be a tough sell. Calvin Coolidge was the last president to win as an incumbent during a recession \u2014 and that was in 1924.\n\nHistory is full of those who lost. President Herbert Hoover ran on the slogan \"prosperity is just around the corner\" in 1932 during the Great Depression, but lost in a landslide to Franklin D. Roosevelt. Ronald Reagan beat President Jimmy Carter in 1980 after asking voters: \"Are you better off than you were four years ago?\" And Bill Clinton used \u201cIt\u2019s the economy, stupid\u201d to push President George H.W. Bush out of office after a single term.\n\n\u201cFrom the days of Theodore Roosevelt to Barack Obama, you don\u2019t get reelected if there\u2019s a recession,\u201c presidential historian Douglas Brinkley said. \u201cTrump would be shattering precedent if he could win reelection when the economy is taking this sort of downturn on his watch.\u201d\n\nAnd despite Trump\u2019s claims of a swift economic rebound starting midyear, his hopes could be dashed if the virus returns in the coming months of reopening or spikes again in the fall as many public health officials predict.\n\nTrump had expected to campaign on a list of what he claimed were his accomplishments, including a booming stock market, rising wages and job growth. He switched his slogan to Keep America Great. But the president\u2019s campaign was transformed as the pandemic spread. Trump faced criticism that he downplayed the outbreak and failed to quickly get tests and medical supplies to states.\n\nInstead, Trump began to focus on restoring the economy, pushing governors to reopen nonessential business even though most states had not yet met the White House benchmarks for easing social-distancing guidelines.\n\nIn online events, social media and interviews, the Trump campaign, the Republican National Committee and White House aides boasted that the businessman-turned-president had once overseen the \u201cgreatest economy in the history of the world.\u201d\n\n\u201cPresident Trump\u2019s record of building the American economy to unprecedented heights before it was artificially interrupted is even more salient now,\u201d said Sarah Matthews, a Trump campaign spokeswoman, in a statement. \u201cHe has been the jobs president and Americans will look to him and his proven success to restore the economy to greatness.\u201d\n\nWhile the campaign continues to attacks Biden on a variety of issues \u2014 his mental acuity, his stance toward economic rival China, alleged hypocrisy amid a sexual assault allegation \u2014 it has added criticism about the economy, too.\n\n\u201cIf the election is a referendum on Trump\u2019s response to the pandemic, he will lose,\u201d said William Galston, an adviser to Clinton during the \u201992 election who now serves as a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. \u201cIf the central question is the prospect for economic recovery looking forward to \u201921 and \u201922, his chances are better.\u201d\n\nThe Trump campaign\u2019s main economic attack on Biden is that as vice president to President Barack Obama, he oversaw the slowest economic recovery since World War II after the 2008 financial crisis. The campaign also accuses him of wanting to raise taxes and implement regulations it claims would hurt American businesses.\n\nThe Biden campaign says Trump badly misrepresents the former vice president\u2019s record.

About 40 years ago, Congress set the taxable earnings cap to cover about 90 percent of all wages, with increases annually to reflect average wage growth. But in 2017, the cap only covered 83 percent of earnings, thanks to rising wage inequality and growing health care costs.\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden has said he would levy the 12.4 percent tax on wages above $400,000 in order to push the program toward solvency.\n\nEven with swift action once the pandemic ends, reforms could take years to implement, Auerbach noted.

POLITICO also reviewed dozens of public records, including court documents, divorce filings and Reade\u2019s 2012 bankruptcy records.\n\nThe accounts paint a picture of Reade\u2019s life in the years leading up to her allegations, in which she spoke often of her connection to Biden but also of troubles in her personal life and a need for money. Sexual abuse victims sometimes offer contradictory information about their alleged abusers, so her comments do not necessarily refute her claims against the former vice president. But they add weight to the evidence that she spoke positively about him in the years before she accused him of digitally penetrating her in the early \u201990s.\n\nReached by phone, Reade declined to answer specific questions and referred the matter to her attorney, Douglas Wigdor.\n\nWigdor argued that Reade\u2019s favorable comments about Biden are no different than how some of Hollywood film producer Harvey Weinstein\u2019s accusers continued to have contact with him even after they said he abused them.\n\n\u201cSort of like some of the late victims of Harvey Weinstein,\u201d said Wigdor, who has represented several Weinstein accusers. \u201cThat is not uncommon.\u201d\n\nBut many of those who knew her well in recent years said she frequently lied or sought to manipulate them, in many instances taking advantage of their desire to help a person they felt was down on her luck.\n\n\u201cYou can use these words: manipulative, deceitful, user,\u201d said Kelly Klett, an attorney who rented Reade a room in her home in 2018. \u201cLooking back at it all now, that is exactly how I view her and how I feel about her.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe has a problem,\u201d said Lynn Hummer, who owns a horse sanctuary where Reade volunteered for two years, beginning in 2014.\n\nShe described Reade as \u201cvery clever, manipulative. ... I do think she\u2019s a liar.\u201d\n\nHummer provided an email from an exchange in which, within weeks of starting at the ranch, Reade asked whether she could bring her car on Hummer\u2019s property to hide it from \u201cthe repo man.\u201d Hummer declined.\n\nIn another instance, Reade came by the ranch desperately seeking $200 to pay the rent, Hummer said. On the way to Reade\u2019s house, Hummer said she didn\u2019t notice that Reade texted her and upped her request from $200 to $350.\n\nHummer also alleged Reade called a veterinarian to the ranch to service her personal horse, leaving Hummer to pay a $1,400 bill.\n\nHummer has publicly leveled that charge and others since Reade\u2019s accusations against Biden have gone public. On social media last month, Reade denied them.\n\n\u201cA lawyer will be in contact with you for defaming me,\u201d Reade said over Twitter . \u201cYou may not continue to spread false information regarding my life.\u201d\n\nIn a brief conversation, Reade said she hoped POLITICO was doing its own reporting and not relying on a March post published on Medium that she said was false.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been getting friends calling me and crying and saying \u2018I never said that,\u2019\u201d Reade said.\n\nWigdor took issue with the premise of this article, saying such scrutiny discourages victims of sexual violence from coming forward.\n\n\u201cIf the assertion is that someone who has lied to their landlord because they don\u2019t have the money to pay rent so then they lied about a sexual assault, I don\u2019t think that is fair journalism,\u201d Wigdor said in an interview.\n\nLike Wrye, Austin Chung, a Monterey-area real estate investor who rented Reade a house from 2008-10, learned of Reade\u2019s charges against Biden from television.\n\n\u201cLook,\u201d he told his wife when he first saw Reade on the screen, \u201cshe has gone big time. She\u2019s going after the big fish now.\u201d\n\nChung said Reade, who went by Alexandra McCabe at the time, claimed that she was on the run from domestic violence and trying to start over.\n\nIn 1996, a judge in San Luis Obispo Superior Court authorized a temporary restraining order against Reade\u2019s then-husband. At the time, the couple had a young daughter together. They later divorced.\n\nHer former husband has denied her claims.", "link": "https://www.politico.com/news/2020/05/15/tara-reade-left-trail-of-aggrieved-acquaintances-260771", "published": "2020-05-15T00:00:00", "author": ["Quint Forgey", "Austin Chung", "Harriet Wrye"]}, {"title": "How Merkel caved to Macron", "text": "Angela Merkel has finally caved to France\u2019s Emmanuel Macron | Guido Bergmann//Bundesregierung via Getty Images Opinion How Merkel caved to Macron Redistribution will not cure Europe\u2019s ailments.\n\nJosef Joffe serves on the Editorial Council of Die Zeit in Hamburg. He is also distinguished fellow of Stanford\u2019s Hoover Institution.\n\nHAMBURG \u2014 Once the uncrowned empress of Europe, Angela Merkel has finally caved to France\u2019s Emmanuel Macron.\n\nEver since Macron captured the Elys\u00e9e in 2017, the German and French leaders have been locked in silent combat over Europe. Merkel stood for reformist vigor and fiscal virtue: no bail-outs, no eurobonds and keep your hand out of our coffers. Macron preached spending, redistribution and centralization.\n\nNow it seems the coronavirus crisis has delivered victory to Paris. Macron and Merkel\u2019s joint unveiling of a European recovery fund worth half-a-trillion euros to bail out the sinking EU economy will remake the bloc in France\u2019s image, turning Europe into a continent-sized welfare state.\n\nThe new recovery fund signals an unprecedented power shift from 27 sovereign nations to the European Commission. This unelected body will borrow hundreds of billions and, in the name of \u201cEuropean solidarity,\u201d hand them over as gifts, not loans.\n\nHow will the mammoth debt be repaid? We\u2019ll worry about that later. Who would feed at the trough? A large part will go to the usual suspects, known as \u201cClub Med\u201d or the \u201cOlive Belt\u201d led by France \u2014 a pre-destined beneficiary of the coming cash bonanza \u2014 and running from Lisbon to Madrid, Rome and Athens.\n\nAs Hamilton, so Macron: The idea is to spread the wealth and fatten the center.\n\nThis power shift recalls America\u2019s fabled \u201cAlexander Hamilton moment\u201d of 1790 when the Feds assumed states\u2019 debts piled up during the Revolutionary War. The first Treasury chief\u2019s generous gesture came with hardball politics, laying out the road to ever-more power for Washington.\n\nAs Hamilton, so Macron: The idea is to spread the wealth and fatten the center. Add Merkel who muses: \u201cAlone, the nation-state has no future.\u201d Onwards and upwards for the United States of Europe.\n\nThere are good reasons however, why such a move has been resisted until now.\n\nAs ostensibly compelling it may be, the U.S.-EU analogy falls flat. The differences are glaring. Unlike the 13 ex-colonies, the EU-27 cannot rely on a common history, language and culture. They\u2019ve been around, as separate identities, since the Roman empire. After crystalizing into nation-states circa 1500, they have fought to the death whoever tried to unify Europe under his knout, from Habsburg to Hitler.\n\nToday, war may be out, but sovereignty is still in. France will not cede the scepter to Germany, and vice versa. The rest will not defer to the duo, nor to Brussels. Since the start of the pandemic, in fact, the nation-state has reasserted itself, as countries close borders and coddle sickly national industries.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the harmful incentives the recovery fund creates, given the eurozone\u2019s current composition (and the varying willingness to reform among its members).\n\nJaundiced economists warned from day one that a common currency requires a real state based on nationhood and obligation. Absent such overriding attachment, how could Brussels take from Peter in Berlin to give to Paolo in Rome?\n\nUnder the euro, capitals must part with sovereignty over economic policy, a pillar of the nation-state. The price is cruel. States can no longer devalue to stay competitive, for francs and liras are gone. Instead, they\u2019re told to stop splurging and borrowing to buy off powerful domestic interests like public-sector unions. They have to get their house in order with painful market reforms that replace short-lived relief with solid growth.\n\nFrance and Italy, No. 2 and No. 3 respectively in the EU\u2019s GDP ranking, have not swallowed the bitter medicine. Instead, they have continued to rack up debt along with the rest of the Olive Belt. After all, why swallow it when you know you no longer have to pay a hefty devaluation premium under the solid-gold euro? Pocket the cheap money instead.\n\nAs deficits and debts soared, the logical next step was a \u201ctransfer union.\u201d Eager to get into the EU kitty, they preferred the dole to more debt.\n\nMeanwhile, Austria, Holland, and the Scandinavians gathered around the German CFO to insist on reform-minded fiscal discipline. The result has been a 20-year power struggle, in which communal virtue kept grinding up against national egotism.\n\nNow, suddenly, Merkel has openly broken ranks, sacrificing Teutonic rigor to Macron\u2019s Gallic ambitions. But if you look to the euro\u2019s tortured history, this is not all that surprising: For years, profligacy has trumped prudence.\n\nEver since European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi famously vowed in 2012 \u201cto do whatever it takes to preserve the euro,\u201d the ECB has dodged the treaty constraints. And behold: At each point, those brutal, arrogant Germans fussed and fumed \u2014 and then paid up.\n\nThe \u201cClub Med\u201d countries got the message: Berlin, which profits most from integration, will not let the project sink.\n\nMerkel\u2019s new tune is not as revolutionary as it sounds; it just formalizes routine practice. Sure, the so-called frugals are not amused, but they will be bought off. The recovery fund will kick in, as have all the other rescue mechanisms since Greece went bankrupt.\n\nThe harsh truth is that a mountain of free cash will not be enough to cure Europe\u2019s ailments.\n\nSo, let\u2019s hold the applause for the Franco-German \u201cengine.\u201d Its recovery fund is where short-term relief trumps Europe\u2019s long-term needs. Why will national governments go up against entrenched interests and pay a murderous political price at home to clean up their economies if they can haul in hundreds of billions for free?\n\nThe harsh truth is that a mountain of free cash will not be enough to cure Europe\u2019s ailments. Those predate the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nFor Europe to rise again, it will have to do more than transfer riches from north to south. The cure is not redistribution, but restarting the engine of growth.\n\nDon't count on Macron, who has been foundering against the armies of the status quo since he took office.

The vast majority traces the border between the city and the surrounding state of Brandenburg via forests, fields, lakes and sleepy suburbia.\n\nIn the three decades since the Wall fell (longer than it stood in place), most of the structure itself has disappeared, memorial rock chipped away chunk by chunk. Instead, there\u2019s the route of a former patrol path through the reforested death strip encircling the western perimeter of Berlin. It's maintained as the so-called Mauerweg for cyclists, and sometimes serves as overflow parkland for those living on the edge of the city.\n\nI started at the old Sonnenallee border crossing (which bears no resemblance to the Wall-era setting of the popular 1999 German comedy film of the same name) walking alone, clockwise, under Berlin's southern belly, equipped with a camera phone and a cycling guide by Michael Cramer, a former Green MEP who made the Mauerweg his legacy in local politics during the 1990s.\n\nWalking the Wall would be a stopgap until the pandemic passed, I thought.\n\nBut just as I reached the waterworld that is Berlin\u2019s upscale, lake-filled southwestern suburbs, Chancellor Angela Merkel appeared on national TV, outlining new restrictions to daily life on March 22. That put a monthlong pause on roaming any further than the supermarket.\n\nFast-forward two months: As I completed the route, the German capital reopened its restaurants and beer gardens, though the socially-distanced economy is still very much in a trial phase. Without anyone there to take a selfie, the plasticky views of Checkpoint Charlie and the East Side Gallery make them feel more like flimsy film sets than sites of profound historical importance.\n\nWalking the whole route in 2020 is apt, as it is mostly based on local administrative borders dating back to 1920, when the Greater Berlin Act expanded the city's boundaries.\n\nThe Wall left multiple exclaves of West Berlin stranded in East Germany, along with various loopbacks and a \u201cduck's beak\u201d of the East inexplicably jutting into the West. Kladow, already on the western shore of the Wannsee lake, was in West Berlin, but Gro\u00df Glienicke, with which it shares another lake, was not.\n\nAlthough the Wall itself is gone, the stories of the 140 lives lost directly as a result of its terror punctuate the route. But there are also more colorful tales, of train driver Harry Deterling who accelerated his passenger service to escape into West Berlin (with commuters on board) in 1961; of Erwin Shabe, a boy who got an armed escort to school after falsely claiming East German soldiers were obstructing his route from the tiny exclave of Eiskeller; and of farmer Helmut Qualitz, who smashed a hole in the Wall with his tractor in 1990 to restore an old link between two communities.\n\nIn the present day, there remain local disagreements over efforts to restore lost infrastructure links. The expansion of the old Dresden railway to offer express airport trains is controversial for locals in the south of the city who have grown comfortable with unobtrusive local services that don't rattle their windows. Up north, plans to reroute the old Heidekrautbahn line have sparked a three-way fight over station-naming rights between suburbs. By my count, the entire Mauerweg route passes more than 10 rail tracks (plus one or two ghost lines) radiating out of the city like spokes on a bicycle wheel.\n\nEven with division long gone, the work to reweave Berlin's urban fabric still isn't finished.", "link": "https://www.politico.eu/article/in-pictures-walking-the-berlin-wall-tracing-a-socially-distant-path/", "published": "2020-05-25T02:00:04+00:00", "author": ["Joshua Posaner", "Michele A.

The coronavirus was happening somewhere else, in Europe and Asia and the United States, but not here in Russia. The country had reacted promptly to potential danger, closing the border with China on January 30, then screening incoming passengers and finally halting all incoming air traffic to keep the invading viral army out. Hospitals were refitted, doctors retrained, and protective gear and equipment sent to every hospital in the country.

The death rate remains low, with only 2,722 deaths so far, although there are doubts about that number too: Recent media reports have shown how Russian methodology for assigning cause of death has lowered the COVID morbidity numbers, perhaps by more than 50 percent. (This was disputed by Deputy Prime Minister Tatyana Golikova.) I don\u2019t know anyone who thinks the statistics are accurate, if only because people were dying from COVID in Russia before anyone was testing for it.\n\nThis was supposed to be a triumphant spring for Putin. Under his stewardship, the country had amassed a huge reserve fund, had confidently started a price war with Saudi Arabia over oil and was arranging a spectacular international event to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the end of World War II. It was planned to be a lavish celebration, where hundreds of foreign leaders and dignitaries, including French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Chinese President Xi Jinping and possibly Donald Trump would stand on the viewing platform above Lenin\u2019s mausoleum and watch a military parade. Millions would march in \u201cImmortal Regiment\u201d parades, honoring relatives who fought in the war; the day would end with banquets, grand concerts and the best fireworks display of the decade.\n\nOrdinary Russians are not worried about big business. They\u2019re worried about themselves.\n\nPutin had also carefully laid the groundwork for a series of political and constitutional moves that would allow him, effectively, to remain in power for the foreseeable future, maybe even for life. In March, the Russian Parliament approved an amendment to the constitution that would limit presidential terms but would also reset Putin\u2019s presidential terms to zero, paving the way for him to stay head of state until 2036, the year he will turn 84. All that remained to seal the deal was a general vote on the constitutional amendments, which was supposed to be held in April.\n\nBecause of the coronavirus, the vote was not held and has not yet been scheduled. The 75th anniversary celebration has been postponed indefinitely. On May 9, when Russia celebrated Victory Day, Putin made a short speech and laid a wreath on the grave of the unknown soldier with little fanfare. A military flyover of 75 planes and helicopters was announced, but I watched it \u2014 they fly directly over my house, rattling the windows and setting off car alarms \u2014 and it looked like barely two dozen. And since no one was supposed to go out in the evening, the only people who saw the fireworks were those who lived near the launch point and had a balcony facing the right direction. The holiday, envisioned as a kind of coronation for Putin\u2019s presidential \u201creset\u201d and the triumphant return of Russia as a world power, went by almost unmarked.\n\nNow, instead of consolidating public support, Putin appears to be losing it. In early May, the Levada Center, Russia\u2019s sole independent polling agency, found that Putin\u2019s approval rating was down to 59 percent. That might sound enviable to Western politicians, but it\u2019s the lowest rating he has had in 20 years. Thirty-three percent of those polled said they did not approve of his performance. Putin\u2019s hold on power doesn\u2019t look as strong as it did a few months ago. His hands-off response to coronavirus might have something to do with it.\n\nOn a morning talk show in early March, I watched the deputy director of the research institute under Russia\u2019s consumer watchdog agency say the situation in the country was \u201cterrific \u2014 we\u2019ve been living for almost three months along a huge border with China and have only five cases, so all the measures we\u2019re taking are clearly effective.\u201d\n\nOn other talk shows, where conspiracy theories reign, hosts and guests floated the notion that the virus didn\u2019t exist. It was a hoax invented by the United States to destroy the Chinese economy, or it was made in an American laboratory and planted in China, or Bill Gates invented it so he could then make money on the vaccine. It was just a version of SARS, which in the end turned out to be less dangerous than everyone feared. Besides, 60,000 people die every year from the flu, and no one cares. What\u2019s the big deal?\n\nSo many people seemed to believe this, or wanted to believe this, that they ignored the increasingly stringent lockdown measures instituted in Moscow beginning March 25 They didn\u2019t practice social distancing, traveled all over the city, used services that were supposed to be closed, got together with friends, sniffed, sneezed, coughed and even spit in public. In stores, unmasked and barehanded, they squeezed every tomato in a bin before moving on to examine broccoli, then pushed and hovered at the cash register despite social distancing marks on the floor.\n\nOn television and social media, we all watched Italians singing on balconies and saw Parisians printing out forms every time they left their apartments. COVID was clearly bad outside Russia. But inside Russia? It was hard to figure out.\n\nFor example, on news shows I saw Russian airports with teams in hazmat suits, checking arriving passengers\u2019 temperatures before releasing them. Some passengers were carefully screened. Then three of my friends flew into Moscow in March, two from Italy and one from Tunisia. I asked them about it. None underwent medical checks at the airport, although they all left contact information for public health authorities. One was never called, the second was called the day after arrival and told to quarantine herself for two weeks, and the third answered the door five days after his arrival to find a guy in a mask, handing him a back-dated, signed sick-leave form and telling him he should have been in quarantine for 14 days since his arrival. No one asked him where he\u2019d been for the past week.\n\nThe worst situation came on April 15, when the city instituted mandatory digital passes for everyone using public or private transportation. Using a cellphone app or a computer, we all had to get QR passes for every trip out of the house, except for walks to the closest pharmacy or grocery store. For some reason \u2014 perhaps to show that the city was serious \u2014 on the first morning the passes went into effect, police stood at the entrances to the metro stations and checked each pass manually, so passengers ended up being tightly packed together for hours in the station halls and underground corridors.\n\nWhen Moscow experienced an 11-day spike in infections two weeks later, in early May, we were wondering if there was a connection.\n\nOf course, in some ways the coronavirus pandemic is playing out in Russia the same way it is everywhere else. Some people are cautious and follow the rules. People who can do their jobs from home do. Schools are closed, and internet memes like dressing as famous works of art have helped occupy the time in lockdown. Zoom has been turned into a Russian verb, and men on bicycles with candy-colored square backpacks speed along the streets delivering food and groceries.\n\nBut in other ways, the pandemic is not playing out in Russia like it has in other countries. Since March 25, Putin has been giving addresses to the nation almost every week promising a safe deliverance from COVID and aid for those who need it, but he is leaving the day-to-day decisions to local leaders and has barely left his residence outside Moscow. Meanwhile, his prime minister, three ministers and press spokesman have tested positive for the virus. Petty crime and scams are on the rise as people who are unemployed run out of money. And as time goes on, the Russian approach of finger-pointing, erratically implemented quarantine measures and little economic aid to those in need seems to be increasingly risky.\n\nEconomically, Putin has taken a different approach to the economic crisis from other world leaders. In other countries, governments have made trillions of dollars available to businesses and ordinary workers to keep them afloat until the economy can restart. But Russia, despite having a rainy day fund worth about $143 billion at the beginning of April (9.8 percent of the country\u2019s gross domestic product), has pledged only about 2.8 percent of GDP to aid primarily small- and medium-size businesses. The American bailout, by contrast, is close to 10 percent of GDP so far. Russia is actually making less than 1 percent of the GDP available in direct payments, with the rest in loan guarantees and tax deferments.\n\nThe Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, the main association for large business interests, has been lobbying for some of the same benefits to be extended to big business, too, and so far has gotten an agreement for loan guarantees of 100 billion rubles ($1.4 billion) from the State Investment Bank. On May 10, the government also agreed to recognize 1,151 companies as \u201csystemically important\u201d \u2014 the Russian version of \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d \u2014 and said it will make preferential loans and other benefits available to them.\n\nIn all of Putin\u2019s six addresses to the nation, he has never once mentioned support of big state enterprises. Konstantin Sonin, an economist and professor at the University of Chicago Harris School of Public Policy, says this was for a simple reason: There\u2019s no need. \u201cThe entire Russian system is based on supporting Russian big state business. All the tools already exist: You go to the president or cabinet to ask for something, like preferential loans, at any time. These companies already have so many opportunities to do this that there is no need to come up with any new procedures.\u201d\n\nOne of my friends put it another way: \u201cHave you filled up your car with gas lately?\u201d I had, at exactly the same price I paid six weeks ago \u2014 maybe even more. Russia has a \u201cshock absorber\u201d system in place that guarantees that the price of filling up your tank never decreases \u2014 even when the cost of Russia\u2019s benchmark crude dropped from $56 a barrel in February to $8.48 a barrel in April.\n\nSo, ordinary Russians are not worried about big business. They\u2019re worried about themselves.\n\nTwice a day I meet up with a group of dog walkers in my local Moscow park for an hourlong stroll, along with news, gossip and complaints about the weather. Some of us have become close friends, the kind who celebrate birthdays together, borrow sugar or money, and spend time at each other\u2019s dachas. I\u2019ve lived in my apartment for more than 25 years; many of the others have known each other since childhood.\n\nDespite the official assurances, by mid-March our only topic was coronavirus. Should we be worried or not? Some were cavalier. \u201cIt\u2019s a bunch of nonsense,\u201d said Masha, the owner of a big friendly mutt. Others were worried, especially if they had health problems or, like one neighbor, a newborn grandchild at home. And we were all worried about the dozen or so small businesses that had appeared on our block in the past couple years \u2014 especially because some of the owners were our neighbors.\n\nAlexander, the owner of a big white boxer, has a nail salon in the building next to us. He was worried. The ruble had already tumbled against the dollar and euro. To be on the safe side, he had borrowed some money from a friend and bought a large stockpile of imported materials. And then he waited. But not for long. Just about a week later, Sobyanin, the Moscow mayor, ordered all nonessential stores and services to close, including Alexander\u2019s nail salon.\n\nIn other countries, salons might have closed immediately. But Alexander was worried about his staff. He called them in to discuss their options, and they decided to take the opposite approach, to keep the salon open late every night until the cutoff date, March 28, so that they could earn enough money to hold them over for a week or so. That was almost two months ago. The salon has been closed since.\n\nAlexander and his wife have other jobs that provide basic income. He thinks some of his staff are earning money doing house calls, and others are just waiting it out. Even when he can reopen, he doesn\u2019t really know how to reopen. \u201cIt\u2019s a question of safety for the staff and customers. I can figure out how to keep two meters between customers, but when will people feel safe and confident enough to come in?\u201d He thinks it may be a year or more before he can recoup losses and pay off the debt in rent he is running up.\n\nAnother neighbor and dog owner Sergei runs a specialty shop. He used to get 35 to 50 orders a day; now it\u2019s two or three. \u201cMy landlord lowered the rent by 40 percent, but that doesn\u2019t help much when income has fallen by 90 percent,\u201d he told me.\n\nI asked Nikolai Petrov, a senior research fellow on the Russia and Eurasia Program at Chatham House in London and professor in the political science department at the Higher School of Economics in Moscow, why he thought Putin was willing to risk alienating voters like Alexander and Sergei.\n\nPetrov said Putin didn\u2019t need their support. \u201cAuthoritarian regimes rely on important people who are key to stability and staying in power,\u201d he said. \u201cPutin\u2019s political base is the big companies, banks and state companies. He doesn\u2019t depend on citizens, so he doesn\u2019t see or hear those 10 or 15 or 20 percent of the population who are really suffering today from the measures to fight COVID.\u201d\n\nOn May 11, Putin announced that the \u201cnational vacation\u201d that had begun in March would end the next day, but that each regional leader would determine how and when to open up businesses. In Moscow, Sobyanin announced that the lockdown would continue until at least the end of the month and now include mandatory gloves and masks in public places, but that several categories of business could open. People shook their heads: Is the situation more dangerous or safer?\n\nAnd there was a new joke making the rounds: \u201cWhen we had 1,000 new infections every day, we were put on lockdown. Now that we have over 10,000 new infections every day, they\u2019re sending us back to work.\u201d\n\nThe problem is that not everyone is going back to work or working at home on salary. Small shops, businesses and services are still closed. In our neighborhood, one beauty salon \u2014 a branch of a citywide chain \u2014 closed and moved out within the first week of the lockdown. Three other shops have closed and might not reopen.\n\nWith the economic pressure mounting, Putin announced in his May address that he would increase aid to the population, mostly through direct payments to families with children, but including tax and insurance write-offs for sole proprietors and even reimbursement of income taxes paid in 2019. I asked my friends if this would help; they laughed. The first round of aid consisted mostly of benefits such as partial debt forgiveness, salary reimbursements if companies continued to pay their staff, and some tax deferments \u2014 none of which they qualified for or needed \u2014 and the current aid package wasn\u2019t enough to make up for their catastrophic loss of income and continued rent payments.\n\nBut neither Alexander nor Sergei had expected state aid. \u201cWe never thought we\u2019d get any support,\u201d Sergei said. \u201cBut that\u2019s the deal. Either you\u2019re free and are totally on your own, or you work for the state and get a salary and aid, but you also have to do what they say, go to political rallies, whatever. Better to be free.\u201d\n\nLooking ahead, it\u2019s clear that millions of small-business people, gig economy workers, waiters, salespeople, actors, dancers, musicians, museum curators, nannies, cleaners, fitness instructors and all those Russians working off the books \u2014 a large portion of the population \u2014 could come out of this with nothing. If they hold on to their businesses, they will probably have a huge debt to pay off. Many thousands, if not millions, of them could lose everything.\n\nTo some extent, given the nature of the crisis, economic pain is inevitable. Sonin says, \u201cThe crisis is unprecedented, and because the government didn\u2019t move quickly and the measures aren\u2019t, to my mind, sufficient, the downturn will be greater. But getting out of this crisis would have been difficult regardless of what Russia did.\u201d\n\nThe government\u2019s approach isn\u2019t going to improve its popularity ratings, Sonin says, but adds, \u201cI don\u2019t think there is a risk of great discontent. In 2008 and 2009, the GDP fell by 9 percent, and the majority of households were cutting back on basic necessities. But the public didn\u2019t rebel then, and I think it will be about the same this time.\u201d\n\nNor does he think this crisis, however difficult, will spur Russian leadership to change: \u201cThere is no discussion of reconsidering priorities, like cutting back on defense spending, security, or propaganda, or repealing the countersanctions, which in my view would have been the first thing to do. There is no discussion of any of that. That\u2019s not being done because they think the way things are is the way the things ought to be.\u201d\n\nPetrov is less sanguine about Russian patience. \u201cPutin zeroed out everything,\u201d Petrov says. \u201cHe wanted to zero out his presidential terms and start over, and he did that. But COVID has zeroed out all his achievements. His rating is low. Today, people don\u2019t care what happened 10 or 20 years ago. He\u2019ll be a leader if he shows himself a leader in the battle with COVID now. So far, he hasn\u2019t achieved anything, and it doesn\u2019t look as if he will.\u201d\n\nMy neighbors are exasperated but resigned \u2014 which is pretty much a default Russian state of mind. Most of them don\u2019t think the government has done a good job of organizing and communicating the response to the coronavirus, but they also think that, for whatever reason, Russia has done better than some other countries. No one knows when and how \u201clife\u201d will begin again, and everyone is looking bleakly ahead to a summer without travel or any sense of normality. \u201cThe thing is,\u201d one friend said, \u201cthe worst may be yet to come.\u201d", "link": "https://www.politico.eu/article/how-russias-coronavirus-crisis-got-so-bad-vladimir-putin-covid19/", "published": "2020-05-24T05:00:39+00:00", "author": ["Michele A.

It's a question of doing the right thing. It's not about what you guys think,\" he said.\n\nThe Scottish National Party and the Liberal Democrats have called on Cummings to resign, while the main opposition Labour Party has written to the U.K.'s most senior civil servant, Cabinet Secretary Mark Sedwill, demanding an \"urgent inquiry\" into the matter.\n\n\"The British people have made important and painful sacrifices to support the national effort, including being away from family in times of need,\" Shadow Cabinet Office Minister Rachel Reeves said in the letter. \"It is therefore vital that the Government can reassure the public that its most senior figures have been adhering to the same rules as everyone else.\"\n\nFielding repeated questions about Cummings' decision to travel and whether it could undermine public adherence to coronavirus guidance, Shapps said: \"Mr. Cummings is in the public eye, but the reality of the matter is that a four-year old child's welfare is the important thing.\"\n\n\"Parents will ask themselves what they would do if they had no other support around and eventually you'd either have to turn to external support, not from your family, or try and be close enough to your family to provide that care, which is what happened in this case.\"\n\nHowever, he said he did not know what other support networks Cummings might have had in London that could have avoided the lengthy trip.\n\nCummings developed coronavirus symptoms shortly after this wife, Mary Wakefield, according to her own account of the family's experience, which does not mention the journey to Durham. Cummings went on to suffer severe symptoms, but Downing Street did not disclose that he had self-isolated in Durham, until reports in the Guardian and the Mirror on Friday evening.\n\nThe papers reported that police from Durham Constabulary had spoken to the Cummings family about the matter \u2014 something Downing Street's own statement contradicted.\n\n\"Owing to his wife being infected with suspected coronavirus and the high likelihood that he would himself become unwell, it was essential for Dominic Cummings to ensure his young child could be properly cared for,\" a No. 10 spokesperson said.\n\n\"His sister and nieces had volunteered to help so he went to a house near to but separate from his extended family in case their help was needed.

Russia\u2019s ongoing selective implementation of its obligations under the Open Skies Treaty has undermined the contribution of this important Treaty to security and stability in the Euro-Atlantic region,\" he said.\n\n\"Russia\u2019s return to compliance is the best way to preserve the benefits of the Treaty,\" Stoltenberg said.\n\nThe treaty is the third building block in international arms control structures that Trump has withdrawn from since taking office, following on from the Iran nuclear deal in 2018 and the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty in 2019.\n\nEuropean officials have also expressed fears over the renewal of the New Start treaty, the last agreement limiting U.S. and Russian strategic nuclear weapons, which is due to expire next February.\n\nCalling the Open Skies Treaty \"crucial,\" the 10 countries that signed Friday's joint statement said they would continue implementing the pact and that it \"remains functional and useful.\"\n\n\"We will continue implementing the Open Skies Treaty which has an obvious added value for our conventional arms control architecture and our shared security,\" the statement said.\n\nThe Europeans also said they would \"continue talking with Russia as previously decided among NATO Allies and other European partners in order to settle the outstanding issues such as the unwarranted restrictions imposed on flights over Kaliningrad,\" and called on Russia to lift them.\n\nRussia reacted on Friday through its Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov, who said the U.S. withdrawal undermines international security, and that Washington had not provided evidence that Moscow is violating the treaty's provisions, according to Reuters.\n\nThis article has been updated with comments from NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg.", "link": "https://www.politico.eu/article/europeans-regret-us-plan-to-withdraw-from-open-skies-treaty/", "published": "2020-05-22T14:45:28+00:00", "author": ["Rym Momtaz", "Bryan Bender"]}, {"title": "France sets date for second round of local elections", "text": "French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe announced the second round of French local elections for June 28 | Benoit Tessier/AFP via Getty Images France sets date for second round of local elections \u2018After weighing the pros and cons, we think that democratic life too should resume,\u2019 says PM.\n\nPARIS \u2014 France will hold the second round of local elections on June 28, coronavirus permitting, Prime Minister Edouard Philippe said Friday.\n\nWhile there is \"no consensus\" among political parties on holding the vote at the end of June, Philippe said the government's \"careful, progressive and reversible\" lockdown exit plan would allow it to be held in a safe way, just as economic and social life are slowly getting back to normal.\n\n\"After weighing the pros and cons, we think that democratic life too should resume,\" Philippe said at a press conference.\n\nHowever, he pointed out that the decision to hold the election is \"reversible\" depending on whether there is a resurgence of the epidemic.\n\nBeyond health considerations, holding the election in June instead of postponing it until later in the year would allow President Emmanuel Macron to turn the page on an election in which his La R\u00e9publique en Marche movement performed poorly in the first round, as he looks to reset his mandate post-coronavirus.\n\nPhilippe, who is in a run-off to be mayor of Havre in the north of the country, also benefits from holding the second round sooner rather than later. His approval ratings are currently among the highest they've been since the beginning of his tenure. If he wins the mayoral race, it would also give him a dignified landing place if the rumors about Macron wanting to sack him turn out to be true.\n\nThe vote was originally meant to be held on March 22, but had to be postponed because of the epidemic. Macron controversially insisted the first round of the election take place on March 15, even though he imposed a nationwide lockdown a day later.\n\nWorries about voter turnout and the election's credibility persist. Voter turnout during the first round was historically low at 45.5 percent, compared with 63.5 percent in the 2014 local elections.\n\nOn Tuesday, Macron spoke with two dozen, mostly opposition, mayors of some of the biggest cities in France and they were almost all in favor of holding the vote on June 28.\n\nPostponing the election beyond the summer would legally require canceling the results of the first round and starting over. The majority of mayors across the country were elected in the first round but most mayors of big cities, including Paris, are in a second round run-off.\n\nNevertheless, Richard Ferrand, the speaker of the lower house of parliament and an LREM heavyweight close to Macron, voiced his opposition to holding the vote at the end of June, arguing that health conditions were suboptimal for proper campaigning.\n\n\"Democracy isn't just voting. It's campaigns that allow debates and [they] can't be held, because gathering of more than 10 people are not allowed, and one can't go door-to-door with a mask on,\" Ferrand said, referring to current health guidelines.\n\nSpeaking alongside Philippe, Interior Minister Christophe Castaner pointed out that while campaigning will have to be adapted to respect health guidelines, candidates would have a month to campaign, which is considerably longer than the usual five days between the two rounds.\n\nThe scientific council advising the government through the epidemic said in a written opinion on Monday that for the second round to be held, strict health guidelines needed to be enforced, including social distancing while queueing to vote, making masks and face shields compulsory for polling station staff and recommending voters wear masks.\n\nReintroducing postal ballots and allowing multiple proxy votes are some of the measures being considered by the government to ensure that vulnerable voters can still take part.", "link": "https://www.politico.eu/article/france-elections-philippe-macron-coronavirus/", "published": "2020-05-22T13:29:00+00:00", "author": ["Rym Momtaz"]}, {"title": "This isn\u2019t Europe\u2019s \u2018Hamilton\u2019 moment", "text": "Sony Kapoor is managing director of Re-Define, an international think tank.\n\nOSLO \u2014 The Franco-German plan for a \u20ac500 billion \u201crecovery fund\u201d has been welcomed with superlatives such as \u201cHamiltonian,\u201d \u201cstunning,\u201d \u201ca game changer\u201d and the somewhat slightly less hagiographic \u201csurprisingly ambitious.\u201d In actual fact, it is just a damp squib.\n\nThe appropriate criteria by which to judge such a proposal are 1) Is it big enough? 2) Is it timely? 3) Does it set a powerful new precedent? 4) How does it fare in the context of the times? and the 5) What is its long-term impact? Sadly, the recovery fund falls far short of even \u201cadequate\u201d on all five.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the fund\u2019s size. The coronavirus has trigged a global economic crisis in which the economies of some EU countries could shrink by between 10 percent and 20 percent. The recovery fund\u2019s \u20ac500 billion amounts to a mere 3.5 percent of EU GDP to be distributed over three to four years. That\u2019s not a game-changer.\n\nNor are the countries that were hardest hit by the crisis likely to get the most money. Resistance from Northern and Eastern Europe make it highly unlikely that hard-it southern countries such as Italy or Spain will get more than twice their quota of about 1 percent of GDP per year. Is a 2 percent of GDP grant to Spain and Italy helpful? Yes. Is it macroeconomically significant? No.\n\nIn truth, the idea that this is the first step in the creation of a \u201cfiscal union\u201d is nothing but hyperbole.\n\nThe fund also fails the test of timeliness with disbursements unlikely to reach countries before next year. To offset the permanent economic damage being done by lockdowns, governments need money now.\n\nWhile Germany has been able to act decisively with more domestic economic support than all the other EU countries put together, Italy and Spain have been more hesitant to act, because of their heavy debt burdens. Further delays in getting aid will leave even deeper scars in their economies that could have been prevented.\n\nThe picture is no better when it comes to setting a precedent. Even commentators who acknowledge the fund is far too small have waxed lyrical about how it \u201ccrosses the Rubicon,\u201d \u201cbreaks taboos\u201d or change the game the way the U.S. Revolutionary War hero Alexander Hamilton did when he federalized the debts of the various U.S. states in 1790.\n\nIn truth, the idea that this is the first step in the creation of a \u201cfiscal union\u201d is nothing but hyperbole.\n\nFirst of all, there\u2019s little here that\u2019s actually new. The European Commission already has \u20ac52 billion of bonds outstanding, and cohesion and structural funds already entail transfers between EU countries. The European Stability Mechanism and the European Financial Stability Facility already saw EU governments band together to borrow to aid troubled members, albeit in the form of loans, not grants.\n\nWhat the recovery fund does not do is make provisions for a permanent increase in the EU\u2019s meager budget or give the Commission the ability to raise its own funds. Nor will existing debt be subsumed into a fiscal union as Hamilton did. Not even the responsibility for the new debt being created will be shared jointly among all EU countries, as the now-abandoned initiative for \"coronabonds\" proposed. The recovery fund is a step toward a dead end, not a fiscal union.\n\nPut in the context of the time, the recovery fund looks even worse. The initiative can be seen as the German establishment\u2019s attempt to make up for the sins of its Constitutional Court, which threw a Molotov cocktail into the EU\u2019s legal and economic order in early May by challenging the actions of the European Central Bank and the Court of Justice of the European Union.\n\nHowever the German court\u2019s decision finally plays out, its immediate impact is to put a de facto political constraint on the size and asymmetry of the ECB\u2019s quantitative easing programs, thereby limiting the ability of the most effective institution in the eurozone to respond to a crisis with appropriate size and timeliness. Italy and Spain would have been better off with an unconstrained ECB and no recovery fund.\n\nThe longer-term consequences of the fund itself may also prove to be negative. It has killed any genuine prospect of a true, much-needed eurobond for good, leaving any \u201cHamiltonian moment\u201d for future, potentially weaker, leaders. Even worse, absent future political agreements, the need to repay the debt incurred by the recovery fund will hollow out the already scarce EU budget.\n\nEU politics is becoming more, not less contentious. If we can\u2019t set aside our petty, parochial politics amid a global pandemic to move toward a fiscal union now, we never will.", "link": "https://www.politico.eu/article/this-isnt-europes-hamilton-moment/", "published": "2020-05-22T11:20:28+00:00", "author": ["Sony Kapoor", "Matthew Karnitschnig", "Rym Momtaz"]}, {"title": "Trump seizes a new cudgel to bash China: Taiwan", "text": "U.S. President Donald Trump | Alex Wong/Getty Images Trump seizes a new cudgel to bash China: Taiwan But even the Trump administration is willing to upgrade ties only so far, fearing Beijing\u2019s wrath.\n\nAs Taiwan\u2019s president was inaugurated for a second term this week, Trump administration officials had some choices to make: How do they congratulate her? Which U.S. official does what?\n\nAnd, above all, how much do they stick it to the Beijing government in the process?\n\nThey ultimately went with a mix: A State Department official and a top White House aide sent video messages for the event, while Secretary of State Mike Pompeo opted for a written statement in advance and some public remarks afterward. The U.S. also announced a potential deal to sell torpedoes to the island, whose disputed political status has long been a fraught subject of U.S.-China relations.\n\nBut U.S. President Donald Trump himself has yet to publicly weigh in.\n\nSo far, the maneuvering has appeared to be aggressive enough to inspire both Taiwanese gratitude and Chinese rhetorical backlash; Beijing has threatened \u201cnecessary measures in response\u201d to America\u2019s expressions of congratulations. But \u2014 for now at least \u2014 the Trump team\u2019s tactics also have been restrained enough to keep tensions from spiraling out of control.\n\nThe U.S. has seized on Taiwan\u2019s success as a hammer with which to hit China.\n\nThe Trump administration\u2019s approach to Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen\u2019s Wednesday inauguration in illustrative of its broader strategy toward an authoritarian government in Beijing that it views as a long-term threat to U.S. dominance: Push Chinese Communist Party leaders hard, but not to the point of diplomatic rupture or open warfare.\n\nIt is a tactic that has been pursued with added vigor in recent months as the coronavirus pandemic has hardened differences between U.S. and China, while giving Taiwan \u2014 which has seen just seven deaths since the outbreak began \u2014 something to boast about. For better or worse, Taiwan \u2014 whose democracy the Trump administration openly supports, but whose independence it does not \u2014 has become a useful cudgel for the United States.\n\n\u201cNo Taiwan official is going to turn down some expression of help that\u2019s offered on a silver platter from the United States,\u201d said Daniel Russel, a former senior Asia hand in the Obama administration. He added, however, that Taiwan\u2019s leaders have \u201cvery mixed feelings. Without a doubt, they harbor a great fear of being used as a pawn or a chip.\u201d\n\nThe relationship between Washington and Beijing has been on a downward slope for years, and it has grown increasingly ugly under Trump because of a tariff-driven trade war he launched over his belief that China was taking advantage of America on the economic front.\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic emerged in China late last year, and Taiwan, thanks to its past experiences with infectious diseases in the region, recognized the danger early. Its technocrat-driven response has severely limited the outbreak on its soil, and it has since touted its success as a counterpoint to Chinese stumbles. Taiwan has, among other moves, sent face masks to other countries, including the U.S. \u2014 part of a \u201cmask diplomacy\u201d strategy that Beijing also has used.\n\nThe U.S. has seized on Taiwan\u2019s success as a hammer with which to hit China.\n\nThe Trump administration recently called on the World Health Organization to allow Taiwan to participate in meetings of the World Health Assembly, its main decision-making body, under observer status. The assembly met this past week, without the Taiwanese being permitted a role amid Chinese resistance. And America\u2019s push for Taiwan\u2019s inclusion was somewhat ironic given Trump\u2019s own recent threats to quit the World Health Organization.\n\nStill, the Trump administration clearly thought the effort was worth it to put Beijing on the spot.\n\n\u201cThe [People\u2019s Republic of China\u2019s] spiteful action to silence Taiwan exposes the emptiness of its claims to want transparency and international cooperation to fight the pandemic, and makes the difference between China and Taiwan ever more stark,\u201d Pompeo said in a statement.\n\n\u201cTaiwan is a model world citizen,\u201d he added, \u201cwhile the PRC continues to withhold vital information about the virus and its origins.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration is also using Taiwan as a weapon in its battle with China over 5G wireless technology.\n\nEarlier this week, American officials heralded an announcement by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, one of the world\u2019s leading computer chip makers, that it would build a factory in Arizona. The next day, the Commerce Department announced a rule change that could bar Chinese tech giant Huawei from doing business with TSMC and other global chip manufacturers.\n\nThe U.S. and Taiwan do not have formal diplomatic relations, and officially the U.S. has a One China policy that recognizes the regime in Beijing as the government of China. But the U.S. and Taiwan maintain strong unofficial relations, as well as robust economic ties, and it is U.S. policy to help Taiwan defend itself against Beijing.\n\nIn the transition period before he took office, Trump agreed to speak to the Taiwanese president, a deviation from diplomatic norms that, while probably not part of a calculated strategy on Trump\u2019s part, stunned Asia watchers. That incident aside, Trump aides have long seen bolstering Taiwan as critical to their pressure campaign on China\u2019s communist leaders.\n\nPerhaps nowhere has the effort to strengthen ties been clearer than in the military-to-military realm.\n\nLast year, the Trump administration greenlit a controversial F-16 fighter jet sale and a $2.2 billion package of M1A2T Abrams tanks and portable Stinger anti-aircraft missiles that infuriated Beijing.\n\nIn keeping with the increased push for weapons sales to Taiwan, the State Department on Wednesday approved a possible sale of 18 submarine-launched torpedoes for $180 million. The proposed sale will serve as a \u201cdeterrent to regional threats,\u201d the department said.\n\nAs China aggressively builds up its military capability, even signaling an increased willingness to attack Taiwan, U.S. officials are now pushing to normalize weapons sales, sell more advanced equipment and even potentially begin conducting joint naval exercises with the island \u2014 all moves sure to further enrage Beijing.\n\nSome of the moves have been fueled by the coronavirus pandemic, which has \u201cclarified\u201d the competition with China in the public sphere, said Elbridge Colby, a former deputy assistant secretary of Defense. \u201cCovid has made it clear that we are in a situation of competition \u2026 to the American people,\u201d he said.\n\nRandall Schriver, who served as assistant secretary of Defense for Indo-Pacific affairs until January, predicted that Washington will seek to help Taipei further modernize its military, potentially with additional sales of coastal missile defenses, spy drones and other intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities.\n\n\u201cThis was the trajectory that was already planned,\u201d Schriver said. \u201cThe recent experience with coronavirus is an accelerant to some of those plans.\u201d\n\nOfficials have also considered enhanced training, including possible joint naval exercises, as a counter to the growing threat from Beijing, Schriver said. Aside from training associated with major foreign military sales such as the F-16 deal, historically, the U.S. military has refrained from exercising with Taiwan because of China\u2019s sensitivities.\n\nOutside the military realm, Taipei is pressing Washington for additional support. For example, Taiwanese officials are pushing for some kind of bilateral trade deal, Schriver noted. Taiwan is already a major U.S. trading partner.\n\nTaiwan\u2019s leaders have repeatedly expressed gratitude for Trump\u2019s support over the years. For instance, Taiwan was one of a few foreign entities to offer aid to the United States \u2014 $800,000 worth \u2014 as Hurricane Harvey wreaked havoc in 2017, a symbolic move more than anything else.\n\nThis week, amid the inaugural festivities, Tsai\u2019s government expressed its pleasure over receiving the various messages of congratulations from U.S. officials. In particular, it highlighted the video messages sent from Assistant Secretary of State David Stilwell and White House deputy national security adviser Matt Pottinger.\n\nBoth men made subtle digs at China in their comments.\n\nStilwell said \u201cthe world owes Taiwan a debt for ringing the alarm\u201d about the coronavirus crisis early on. Pottinger, speaking in fluent Mandarin, hit a similar point, indirectly tweaking Beijing by reminding it that the illness began on its soil \u2014 a point China has at times sought to dispute through some of its messaging.\n\n\u201cTaiwan learned critical lessons from the 2003 SARS epidemic,\u201d Pottinger said, according to a translation shared on Tsai\u2019s Twitter account, \u201cand applied them in advance of the outbreak of the mysterious disease the Chinese state-controlled media called \u2018Wuhan pneumonia.\u2019\u201d\n\nPompeo did not go so far as to send a video message or engage in a phone call with Tsai, and Trump has kept silent, at least as far as has been publicly acknowledged. Serious direct engagement by a U.S. president or even his chief diplomat could have enraged Beijing well beyond its usual anger at U.S.-Taiwan overtures, analysts said.\n\nBut Pompeo\u2019s issuance of a written congratulatory statement \u2014 which called Taiwan a \u201cforce for good in the world,\u201d referred to Tsai as \u201cTaiwan\u2019s president\u201d and was read aloud during Tsai\u2019s inauguration ceremony \u2014 was a highly unusual, likely unprecedented, move.\n\nThe secretary of State further praised Taiwan during a press conference on Wednesday. However, Pompeo sidestepped a question on whether the U.S. should consider formalizing its relationship with Taipei, instead using the moment to criticize what he said was Beijing\u2019s handling of the pandemic.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re beginning to work to make sure we get America First, that we get this foreign policy right, and that we respond to these risks that the Chinese Communist Party presents to the United States in an appropriate way,\u201d Pompeo said.\n\nTaiwanese officials are careful in how they speak about the all-important relationship with the U.S., mindful of Beijing\u2019s red lines.\n\nChina\u2019s government reacted in harsh but predictable terms to the American expressions of support for Taiwan this week, saying it threatens the bilateral relationship between Beijing and Washington.\n\n\u201cChina will take necessary measures in response to the U.S. erroneous practices, and the consequences will be borne by the U.S. side,\u201d Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said Wednesday.\n\nPeople close to Taiwanese leaders say they are, for the most part, thrilled with the Trump administration\u2019s pro-Taipei bent so far, but there are some lingering disappointments, some centered on diplomatic protocols.\n\nThe fact that no senior U.S. official visits Taiwan, despite U.S. legislation that encourages such travel, is one sore point. Another is the restrictions around the types of meetings Taiwanese representatives get with U.S. diplomats. Taiwan doesn\u2019t have an embassy in Washington; its interests are instead represented by what\u2019s known as the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office.\n\nTaiwanese officials are careful in how they speak about the all-important relationship with the U.S., mindful of Beijing\u2019s red lines. A TECRO representative said that Taiwan was \u201cgrateful for the support from our diplomatic allies, as well as the United States, Japan, and many other like-minded countries on the issue of Taiwan's participation in the World Health Assembly.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the little things,\u201d said one person close to TECRO officials. Trump aides \u201call say, \u2018I love Taiwan, it\u2019s wonderful, it\u2019s the greatest democracy in East Asia.\u2019 But the Taiwanese can\u2019t meet in the State Department. They have to meet in a restaurant.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s also the always unnerving questions about how reliable Trump himself truly is, given his vacillation toward China over the years and his occasional broadsides against longstanding allies.\n\nWhile Trump campaigned for office on an anti-China message, he has generally tried to maintain a good relationship with Chinese leader Xi Jinping. He even praised Xi\u2019s early response to the pandemic, possibly to protect an early-phase trade deal between the two countries and hopes of a bigger deal later.\n\nIn the same vein, Trump has kept to a minimum his comments on China\u2019s human rights abuses in places like Hong Kong, where a pro-democracy movement has been met with crackdowns.\n\nBut Trump also has questioned the One China policy. Just days ago, he floated the idea of ending ties to Beijing, claiming, \u201cYou\u2019d save $500 billion if you cut off the whole relationship.\u201d\n\nHe also recently jabbed at Xi, saying the Chinese leader was behind a \u201cdisinformation and propaganda attack on the United States and Europe.\u201d China bashing also is a main theme of Trump\u2019s ongoing reelection campaign.\n\nUltimately, \u201cthere is a tremendous amount of ambivalence in Taiwan and worry,\u201d said Russel, whose positions in the Obama administration included serving as senior director for Asian Affairs at the National Security Council. \u201cAnd there\u2019s reason to worry that Trump will lose interest in Taiwan. He\u2019d trade away Taiwan in a heartbeat if he thought it would get him his trade deal with China.\u201d\n\nThere are limits to how far the Trump administration is willing to go for Taiwan.\n\nThe administration appears to have no immediate plans to formally recognize Taiwan\u2019s government, a measure viewed as extreme given Beijing\u2019s longstanding demand that Taipei reunify with China under the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d proposal, Schriver said.\n\nAnd, despite the opportunity posed by the unusually tense relations between the U.S. and China, there\u2019s no discussion of supporting a Taiwanese bid for formal independence from Beijing. Such a move would be so provocative toward China that one senior Trump administration official said the sky \u201cwould fall.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo one has ever talked about independence,\u201d the official said. \u201cEven the hard-core Taiwan lobby in D.C. doesn\u2019t seriously say that.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s probably fine with Taiwan\u2019s current leadership. On the island\u2019s complicated political spectrum it is often cast as pro-independence, but it is also cognizant that declaring all-out independence anytime soon could prompt far more than just tough talk from Beijing.\n\nThe Taiwanese are \u201cpainfully aware of the fact that, while China may have limited options to punish the U.S., it has more options for punishing Taiwan,\u201d Russel said.", "link": "https://www.politico.eu/article/trump-seizes-a-new-cudgel-to-bash-china-taiwan/", "published": "2020-05-22T05:36:57+00:00", "author": ["Nahal Toosi", "Lara Seligman", "Bryan Bender", "Michael Kruse"]}, {"title": "China flexes its trade muscles", "text": "Charles Dunst is an associate at LSE IDEAS, the London School of Economics\u2019 foreign policy think tank.\n\nNo matter how you look at it, China\u2019s treatment of Australia during the coronavirus crisis is a cautionary tale.\n\nAfter incompetently letting the coronavirus loose on the world, Beijing slapped tariffs on Australian barley this week in an unmistakable show of muscle after Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said last month that he wanted an independent inquiry into the COVID-19 outbreak.\n\nFor the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), the move is obviously intended as a warning for other leaders considering standing up to Beijing. For European countries like Germany, the Netherlands and Italy , which export billions of dollars worth of goods to China every year, it should serve as a wake-up call about what it means to be dependent on Chinese trade.\n\nBeijing has said the tariffs are a response to what it considers \u201cdumping\u201d by Australian barley producers. But it comes just weeks after the Chinese ambassador to Australia threatened a Chinese boycott in response to Morrison\u2019s comments: \u201cWhy should we drink Australian wine? Why eat Australian beef?\u201d\n\nThe fact that China, itself a trade surplus country, is willing to use punitive trade actions as a first-resort response should indeed alarm Beijing\u2019s European partners.\n\nThe editor-in-chief of the state-run Global Times newspaper then described Australia as \u201cchewing gum stuck on the sole of China\u2019s shoes\u201d (an attack that is particularly aggressive in Asia), adding: \u201csometimes you have to find a stone to rub it off.\u201d\n\nWhen Canberra pressed forward with its calls for an inquiry, Beijing suspended imports from Australia\u2019s top meat processing facilities and imposed the tariffs on barley \u2014 measures that could cost the country upward of $500 million annually.\n\nEuropean exporters dependent on China are similarly exposed to the CCP\u2019s pressure. Given Beijing\u2019s now-demonstrated willingness to retributively leverage trade relationships for political purposes, China\u2019s European partners should seriously reconsider their own economic interdependence with the country and think about careful decoupling from the Asian giant\u2019s economy.\n\nAustralia\u2019s relationship with China soured in 2018 when the former banned the effectively Chinese state-owned company Huawei from its nascent 5G network. Despite American lobbying and cybersecurity fears, the European Union ruled out banning Huawei, leaving the decision to individual member countries.\n\nGerman operators Deutsche Telekom, Vodafone and Telefonica are all Huawei clients. German Chancellor Angela Merkel favors a level playing field for all providers, although some within her party favor banning the company. But when Germany debated Huawei, China\u2019s ambassador there threatened \u201cconsequences\u201d if Germany excluded the telecoms giant from its market.\n\nGermany\u2019s hesitance to ban Huawei, likely due to fear of Chinese retribution, will surely be augmented by China\u2019s aggressive approach to Australia. These fears are not misguided, given that Germany exports some $95 billion of goods, namely cars and vehicle parts, to China every year \u2014 and that a disturbing percentage of that could disappear at the snap of the CCP\u2019s fingers.\n\nGermany is not the only vulnerable European state. Italy exports around $16 billion of goods to China annually. Dutch exports to China are worth around $12 billion per year.\n\nFor these and Beijing\u2019s other European trade partners, Chinese billions come at a moral cost: placation of the CCP, a repressive regime currently carrying out a cultural genocide of China\u2019s Uighur Muslims.\n\nSuch placation was perhaps best evinced in late April when European Union officials bowed to CCP pressure and softened their criticism of China in a report on disinformation.\n\n\u201cChina has continued to run a global disinformation campaign to deflect blame for the outbreak of the pandemic and improve its international image,\u201d the initial report said. After China got wind and threatened the European Union, Brussels\u2019 senior officials ordered revisions \u201cto soften the language.\u201d\n\nEuropean appeasement of the CCP is no accident; it is the result of European leaders\u2019 economic calculations. Many European governments are now in too deep and simply do not want to deal with the financial headache of falling out of Beijing\u2019s good graces. China, in response to any perceived slight, could impose damaging tariffs on German car parts, Italian cars or Dutch malt extract.\n\nChina\u2019s harsh treatment of Australia \u2014 at a moment when the latter faces its worst economic conditions since the Great Depression \u2014 further serves Beijing\u2019s aims by demonstrating its global power and heightening European concerns, thus preemptively shutting many European mouths from criticizing the CCP.\n\nThe fact that China, itself a trade surplus country, is willing to use punitive trade actions as a first-resort response should indeed alarm Beijing\u2019s European partners. It should also prompt them to prepare punitive economic policies, such as tariffs on Chinese goods that recipient states can easily find elsewhere. This could have a substantial impact, given that annual Chinese exports to Germany are worth around $110 billion, for instance.\n\nSuch a response, however, requires European leaders to wake up from their dream of liberal internationalism, recognize the reality of Chinese authoritarianism and reevaluate their countries\u2019 relationships with a great power whose illiberal ruling regime demands complicity. Trade with China is deeply intertwined with the CCP\u2019s construction of an illiberal Sino-centric world order. Europe can no longer pretend otherwise.\n\nEurope\u2019s leaders would be wise to pursue careful decoupling or at least preemptively prepare retaliatory steps \u2014 lest they find themselves coerced into the Beijing\u2019s illiberal global order or reduced to gum on the sole of the CCP\u2019s shoe.", "link": "https://www.politico.eu/article/china-flexes-trade-muscles-coronavirus-crisis/", "published": "2020-05-22T02:07:30+00:00", "author": ["Charles Dunst", "Janka Oertel", "David Wertime"]}, {"title": "If you have no sense of taste, lock yourself away immediately", "text": "Welcome to Declassified, a weekly column looking at the lighter side of politics.\n\n(Important note: I'm not a doctor but I have set my Zoom background to 'operating theater')\n\nSomebody notify Ed Sheeran fans!

This has cut off its main source of income and created a substantial budget deficit.\n\nThe British Council is a public body funded by the Foreign Office and a charity that promotes the learning of English, funds research and training of English teachers and runs culture diplomacy events. It has already received \u00a326 million of emergency funding from the government on top of its annual grant of \u00a3161 million, and has furloughed 18 percent of its roughly 1,175-strong U.K. workforce.\n\nHowever, the Public and Commercial Services Union and parliamentarians have raised concerns that this will not fill the funding gap, and reserves might run out by the end of May.\n\nThe organization is holding talks with officials over long-term emergency funding, but one official said the government wants to wait until the full impact of the pandemic is clear before committing extra money.\n\nA spokesperson for the British Council said, \u201cCOVID-19 has had a significant impact on our finances. We\u2019re grateful for the short-term funding from the U.K. government and we are in constructive talks with the government to identify a long-term solution.\u201d\n\n'Enlightened self-interest'\n\nIn the 2019-20 financial year, the British Council managed to increase its income to \u00a31.33 billion from \u00a31.25 billion the previous year, despite a 9.5 percent cut in the government\u2019s grant.\n\nCrossbench peer Jean Coussins, who co-chairs the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Modern Languages, urged the government to rescue the British Council.\n\n\u201cFurther support is essential before the end of May to ensure that the organization has a future,\u201d she said. \u201cIf ever there was a case for a government bailout based on enlightened self-interest, it is this.\n\n\u201cI hope the conversations [with government] pay off very rapidly because it is the end of May that is the crucial cut-off date for the British Council to know where it stands financially in order to know whether it can continue its work, so this is very urgent,\u201d she added.\n\nThe PCS union, which has launched a campaign to save the British Council, fears mass redundancies and pay cuts might be looming. The British Council employs about 12,000 staff in more than 100 countries.\n\nThe University Council of Modern Languages, which represents modern languages scholars, has written to Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, saying that \u201ceverything the Council undertakes across its many schemes and programs responds in a direct and concrete way to the government\u2019s Global Britain strategy.\u201d\n\nUCML\u2019s chair, Claire Gorrara, said: \u201cThe British Council has been the biggest ambassador for British culture and values abroad through its English language teaching programs and cultural diplomacy. That would be a massive challenge for the U.K. higher education sector given that we are going to be facing a very, very big change in terms of Brexit and the loss of international partnerships.\n\n\u201cThe British Council is one of the most trusted British institutions abroad with many, many years of experience and relationships, and it would in some extent undermine Global Britain\u2019s strategy if one of its most effective and successful ambassadorial arms effectively is lost.\u201d\n\nA spokesman for the Foreign Office said the government is helping the British Council in accessing job retention schemes to enable them to furlough staff, in addition to the \u00a326 million of emergency funding.\n\n\u201cThis will help it support its workforce, and those employed through its partners, who are normally funded through its commercial side.

Quite a welcome party. Several years on, Akkad has hit pause on his life in his adopted home and stepped in to work as a cleaner in his local hospital. In between cleaning shifts, he's made portraits of the workers around him who are helping battle the coronavirus pandemic. He spoke with POLITICO last week about his experiences, and what it feels like to be thrown back into a crisis upturning everyone's lives. Keep up with Hassan's work on his Twitter feed. The captions to the portraits below are Hassan's, as posted to social media.\n\nTell us a little about how you\u2019ve been spending your days since this all started.\n\nThe people at the front lines of this crisis amaze me every day with their resilience, care and professionalism. It\u2019s my honor to be able to share their stories.\n\nAs I\u2019m sure you can imagine, my daily rhythm has changed entirely. My shift starts at 7 a.m., so I\u2019m up as the sun is rising, preparing for the day at work. I do an eight-hour shift, which includes mopping, scrubbing and disinfecting high-touch surfaces throughout the COVID-19 ward. Typically, I finish around 3 p.m. and go home to my fianc\u00e9e. She\u2019s currently working full time as well, from home. It\u2019s busy, but we always try to carve out some time for each other. She\u2019s been incredibly supportive of me and my work. I find the biggest challenge is unwinding at the end of the day, especially when it\u2019s been an intense shift.\n\nWhy did you feel compelled to get involved in this way? Was it just a matter of \u201clet me help, in any way I can?\u201d\n\nNearly two months ago, when the virus was declared a global pandemic but no measures were in place yet in the U.K., I felt similar to how I felt at the start of the revolution in Syria back in 2011. An uncertain, major shift was taking place. As the virus started spreading in the U.K. and the number of cases announced on the news grew exponentially, it became clear to me that life could not continue as \u201cnormal.\u201d\n\nFor me, this meant temporarily stepping away from my work as a filmmaker and photojournalist, and finding a way to make a more direct contribution to my community. I applied to the NHS volunteering scheme, and for seasonal work in agricultural fields outside London, but didn\u2019t get a response. So I did some food shopping deliveries for my neighbors instead. After a few days of trying to make myself as useful as possible, I came across a call for cleaners for my local hospital, Whipps Cross. They called me back the day after I submitted an application.\n\nWhat are you seeing in the halls and rooms of the hospital currently? Are the workers who have been going non-stop for weeks finally getting a chance to breathe, or are things just as frantic as ever?\n\nI started during the peak. That was 45 days ago. The ward has 18 beds and during that time we never had an empty one. All the staff were working long hours. I could see the exhaustion on my ward manager, Pilar\u2019s, face. I could see it on everyone\u2019s face. But everyone was going above and beyond to keep my ward \u2014 Birch ward \u2014 running.\n\nThe intensity in the ward has lessened in the past couple of weeks due to the reducing number of COVID-19 cases. We have been able to take days off to breathe and to reflect. We've started talking about the intensity of what we witnessed during the peak and are trying to prepare for the uncertainty of the future, because uncertainty has come hand in hand with this virus. No one really understands it but we were, and still are, working really hard to combat it.\n\nWhile we are past the peak, there is still a lot of suffering. There are still patients, who I have become friends with, who are not getting better and who are unable to be physically close to their loved ones. That doesn\u2019t get any easier. If anything, the emotional toll that comes with having time to reflect is just as heavy as the shift work.\n\nWhipps Cross hospital is an incredible operation. I see porters constantly getting things where they need to be \u2014 from patients in beds, to supplies, to PPE and chairs. I see the catering staff and ward hosts getting the food from the kitchen and prepping it for the patients. As cleaners, we're disinfecting every inch of the hospital. Nurses are in and out of the ward keeping a watchful eye on patients. Consultants and doctors are in their offices constantly on their phones and computers checking on patients almost every hour. I see phlebotomists coming to take blood samples to take to the lab. I see the security guard at the door making sure everyone is safe.\n\nWhat I see in the ward is humanity at its best. Individuals taking care of others as they would their own. Recently, I\u2019ve watched many patients be discharged. Seeing the staff who cared for them wave goodbye, with big smiles on their faces, is amazing.\n\nOne of the things you\u2019ve talked about repeatedly is the diversity not just of your adopted city, but of the NHS workers responding to this situation. How does it make you feel to see so many people, who come from so many different places, all working as one to help their neighbors?\n\nIt makes me feel proud, and humbled. The diversity of NHS workers is not new. International nurses, porters, cleaners, doctors and ward hosts have formed the backbone of the NHS for as long as it has been around. It isn\u2019t so much about seeing them all coming together to help their neighbors \u2014 they\u2019ve always done that \u2014 it\u2019s about acknowledging it in a concrete way. I definitely have hope, but what is really needed is action and policy change.\n\nMy friends at Choose Love recently summarized it perfectly. They said, \u201cwhile the hard work and sacrifices many migrant workers are making on the frontline of this crisis should be recognized and remembered, no one should have to risk their lives in order to be recognized as a human being. A person\u2019s \u2018usefulness\u2019 should not define their worth. We should recognize and respect our common humanity, regardless of immigration status. Not just in a crisis, but all the time.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve been asked several times if I\u2019ve felt it\u2019s my duty to \"pay back\" my community. The answer is no and yes. The right to seek asylum and freedom from torture is innate and inalienable. My refugee status is also my right under international humanitarian law. Refugees shouldn\u2019t have to \"earn\" protection twice. I volunteered to work at the hospital, and if I hadn\u2019t made that decision, I would still be just as entitled to my asylum status. However, as a proud Londoner, I do feel it's my duty to support my community. I wanted to support my neighbors. If we come together in kindness and love, wherever we\u2019re from, whatever we look like, and no matter how much we make, we can fundamentally reshape this world.\n\nTo that end, has this crisis \u2014 watching it, participating in the response to it \u2014 changed how you view migration policy in the U.K. at all?\n\nI\u2019m curious to see how this collective experience changes migration policy in the U.K.. This year was already going to be defined by questions about the kind of country we want to be as we leave the EU. Where initially it looked like the pandemic would pause those conversations for the foreseeable future, I think now we\u2019re seeing that it\u2019s actually enlivened them, and involved everyone in them.\n\nIt\u2019s never been clearer that we\u2019re global citizens \u2014 our well-being complexly intertwined with that of other countries \u2014 whether we like it or not. \"Unskilled\" immigrant workers are now \"essential\" and \"key.\" These make up a large chunk of the people we're clapping for from our doorsteps every Thursday evening. We can't go back to the same anti-immigrant, xenophobic rhetoric and policy that was so widespread before, and which continues to be normalized. I see energy for correcting past mistakes, and that gives me hope.\n\nHow are family and friends back in Syria, and elsewhere, handling the pandemic and what comes with it? Are you still able to keep in regular touch with the loved ones who aren\u2019t physically near you?\n\nSocial distancing isn\u2019t new to us Syrians. The revolution which turned into a proxy war back in my home country has driven a Syrian diaspora around the world. When my brother \u2014 with whom I shared a bedroom for 22 years \u2014 got married, I attended on Skype. I've watched my niece and nephew grow up on Skype. My parents celebrated my engagement eight months ago on Skype. This isn\u2019t new to us. We are familiar with the queues outside supermarkets and with the constant worry for loved ones \u2014 because they're in detention centers. Children aren't going to school \u2014 because their schools were bombed.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t think of comparing what you fled in Syria to what\u2019s happening now in the U.K. and around the world \u2026 They\u2019re both crises, but the similarities, I would think, end there. But how did one inform the other? If you hadn\u2019t experienced such upheaval and turmoil and conflict in Syria, do you think you\u2019d have had the same reaction to dig in and help in your new home?\n\nWhen the pandemic hit I panicked, because I was triggered. A crisis on a much bigger scale hit my first home, and now I can see and feel it hitting my adopted home. But in the U.K., the army is working around the clock, sourcing medical supplies and delivering them to hospitals. In Syria, the army systematically targeted and bombed hospitals. While there are some similarities, this pandemic is not a \"great leveler,\" as some people have described. It\u2019s experienced differently depending on your circumstances. I've seen it described as \"the great magnifier,\" which I think is more accurate.\n\nWorking on the COVID-19 ward has awoken something in me I hadn't felt since 2011, when I stood up with my fellow Syrians to peacefully protest the Assad regime as a united front with a larger purpose. Now, I stand again to support my community and Whipps Cross, and to advocate for the rights of migrant and working-class communities both in the U.K. and around the world. I invite everyone to join me in this effort.", "link": "https://www.politico.eu/interactive/in-pictures-nhs-workers-fighting-to-keep-a-covid-19-ward-safe/", "published": "2020-05-21T02:53:11+00:00", "author": ["Tim Ball"]}, {"title": "White House weighs shorter extension of nuclear arms pact with Russia", "text": "A Russian Yars RS-24 intercontinental ballistic missile system drives during the Victory Day military parade in Moscow on May 9, 2015 | AFP via Getty Images White House weighs shorter extension of nuclear arms pact with Russia The option is part of a strategy that would also seek a broader agreement with Moscow that possibly includes China.\n\nThe U.S. is weighing a face-saving strategy for keeping an Obama-era nuclear treaty from expiring while it pursues a more sweeping arms pact with both Russia and China, according to current and former Trump administration officials with direct knowledge of the deliberations.\n\nUnder the plan, the White House would temporarily extend the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty while seeking a new agreement with Moscow that also tries to convince China to come to the table, they said.\n\nThe diplomatic formula is viewed at the U.S. State Department and National Security Council as a promising way to both prevent the New START from expiring in February and getting Russia to agree \u2014 at least in principle \u2014 to more comprehensive limits on nuclear arms.\n\n\"Both approaches are available, or a mix thereof,\" said a State Department spokesperson who asked not to be named.\n\nNew START is one of the last remaining pacts aimed at keeping the world's largest atomic arsenals in check. But concerns have grown among Republicans and Democrats that President Donald Trump could walk away just as he has jettisoned the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty with Russia and the Obama-era nuclear pact with Iran.\n\nThe administration's potential approach has gained traction in recent weeks as the Trump administration faces growing criticism that Trump\u2019s goal of negotiating a broader nuclear treaty with both Moscow and Beijing before New START expires is unrealistic and, if it fails, risks igniting a full-blown nuclear arms race.\n\n\u201cThere are a host of options or steps that could be taken to accomplish the president\u2019s direction, some of which could be done in fairly short order,\u201d said an administration official also involved in the deliberations. \u201cThere's not a one-size-fits-all model.\u201d\n\nArms control experts raised a number of questions and concerns, noting that the approach still poses a risk to New START with no guarantee that any follow-on pact would be as enforceable.\n\nBut it also has intriguing possibilities, said Jon Wolfsthal, who oversaw nuclear policy on the National Security Council in the Obama administration.\n\n\"A six-month extension to buy yourself some time to negotiate something new with the Russians \u2014 and call on the Chinese to join \u2014 inherently isn't bad,\" said Wolfsthal, who is now a senior adviser to Global Zero, a disarmament group. \"It might be a way to square the circle \u2014 if you can also be sure that the next administration has the leeway to extend [New START] more.\"\n\nNew START, which was signed by President Barack Obama and Vladimir Putin in 2010 and ratified by the Senate, limits strategic nuclear arms on both sides to 1,550. It also includes detailed verification measures such as on-site inspections to ensure both sides are complying.\n\nRussia said publicly late last year it is willing to extend the treaty the full five years without preconditions. So far, the Trump administration has insisted that the treaty is flawed because it doesn't cover a series of nuclear arms in the Russian arsenal such as tactical warheads.\n\nThe U.S. has not committed to an extension of the treaty and says Trump instead wants to replace it with a more comprehensive agreement that covers more classes of weapons to include stringent verification measures.\n\n\u201cThis is crucial because we\u2019re talking about two countries with abysmal track records in terms of treaty compliance,\u201d Marshall Billingslea, Trump's special envoy for arms control, recently told the Washington Times. \u201cRussia has violated nearly every single agreement we\u2019ve ever had with them \u2014 and the Chinese stand in violation of a number of agreements that they\u2019ve also signed.\u201d\n\nOfficials said the first element of the strategy now under serious consideration would be an extension of New START, but for a significantly shorter duration that the maximum five years permitted under the treaty.\n\nWolfsthal said one major issue is whether the treaty could legally be extended again if the U.S. and Russia \u2014 not to mention China \u2014 failed to reach any follow-on agreement before the New START extension ran out.\n\n\"Could you have multiple extensions as long as those multiple extensions don't exceed a five-year period?\" he asked. \"There is some concern that this administration, in order to kill New START, would say we are going to extend six months, but then you burn your bridge. Others are saying, 'No, you can extend for six months and then extend for four-and-a-half years or three years, as long as the extension periods don't total more than five years.'\"\n\nAn even more controversial move would be to pursue a new agreement with Moscow that doesn't clearly spell out how compliance would be guaranteed.\n\nA former government official who closely tracks nuclear policy described the administration's evolving thinking as reflecting a growing reality that this late in the president\u2019s term \u2014 and as relations with Russia and China continue to suffer \u2014 the administration is not likely to be able to achieve the kind of historic diplomatic breakthrough Trump has been promising.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think anybody ever thought they were going to get an official deal but they wanted at least [a] gentleman\u2019s agreement,\u201d the former official said. \u201cI\u2019ve heard that used many times in terms of what they want to get from the Russians.\u201d\n\nThe administration could seek a \u201cone-year or two-year extension of the treaty while they get something \u2014 a gentleman\u2019s agreement is probably too light, I think they wanted something in writing,\u201d the former official explained. \u201cBut it wouldn\u2019t be a binding legal document. I think it would just be in principle.\u201d\n\nAdded the State Department spokesperson: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t necessarily need to look just like New START.\"\n\nSome officials have held out the prospect of a follow-on agreement more akin to the 2002 Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty, also known as the Moscow Treaty.\n\nSigned by Putin and then-President George W. Bush, it called for further cuts to nuclear arms on both sides but was less prescriptive than similar treaties and included fewer constraints on how each side could carry out its commitments. Some critics used its acronym to call it the \"sort of\" treaty.\n\nBut a major element at the time was that START I, which predated New START, was still in place for seven more years, and the Moscow Treaty was able to piggyback on its verification measures.\n\n\"You still had inspectors on the ground in both countries,\" said Wolfsthal. \"You still had a fence around their missile production facilities and X-rayed what went out. The intelligence community could certify that we have high confidence that Russia's was complying with the Treaty of Moscow because of the START verification provisions.\"\n\nWithout new verification procedures, a short extension of New START would unlikely offer such backup \u2014 and that gives arms control advocates pause.\n\n\"Gambling with the benefits that New START provides on a very low-odds-of-success bet that a short-term extension will convince the Russians and the Chinese to come to the table and meet our terms does not strike me as a smart or responsible approach,\" said Kingston Reif, director for disarmament and threat reduction policy at the Arms Control Association.\n\nThe State Department, however, says it hopes to restart talks with Russia as soon as possible and reiterated its invitation for China to join the discussions.\n\n\"Russia has stated that it has no preconditions to extension, which is a position that we will remember,\" said the spokesperson. \"In December 2019 we separately formally invited China in good faith to begin a strategic security dialogue on nuclear risk reduction, arms control, and their future. We hope to begin this as soon as possible. We await Beijing\u2019s response.\"\n\nBut the biggest immediate question, says Wolfsthal, may be whether Trump can be convinced to take the first step.\n\n\"The central question is whether there is a way to convince Trump to extend an Obama treaty,\" he said. \"There is a lot of doubt about that.\"\n\nLara Seligman and Nahal Toosi contributed to this report.", "link": "https://www.politico.eu/article/white-house-weighs-shorter-extension-of-nuclear-arms-pact-with-russia/", "published": "2020-05-20T23:36:36+00:00", "author": ["Bryan Bender"]}, {"title": "Most Americans say Germans tackled coronavirus better than US: report", "text": "Log in to access content and manage your profile.

In the end, though, whether it was his ill-conceived airline, his debt-saddled casinos or his professional football misadventure, Trump\u2019s failure to heed warnings from even his most trusted advisers often served to enhance his celebrity with a sufficient portion of the public that doesn\u2019t take the time to parse the particulars.\n\n\u201cIt would take an hour and a half to learn everything there is to learn about missiles\u201d \u2014 Trump in 1984\n\n\u201cHe thinks he\u2019s the smartest guy on the planet,\u201d former Trump Shuttle President Bruce Nobles told me Tuesday. \u201cHe really does.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like when he used the Sharpie on that hurricane map,\u201d said former Trump Organization Executive Vice President Barbara Res, referring to the episode last year in which Trump cartoonishly used a marker to alter a map of the path of a storm and then fought about it for a week rather than admit the smallest of mistakes.\n\nAnd now with hydroxychloroquine? \u201cHe\u2019s going to prove that he was right,\u201d said Sam Nunberg, a former Trump political adviser, \u201cwhen everybody else said he was wrong.\u201d\n\n\u201cAllll about the base,\u201d Republican strategist and Trump critic Rick Wilson told me in a text on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got to tell those people, \u2018Of course I\u2019m taking hydroxy,\u2019\u201d former Trump White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci explained. \u201c\u2018They\u2019re telling you it doesn\u2019t work, but I\u2019m telling you it does. I am your chief of the red tribe of Trump.\u2019\u201d\n\n* * *\n\nExperts? Who needs experts? \u201cIt would take an hour and a half to learn everything there is to learn about missiles,\u201d Trump said in 1984, telling a reporter he wanted to negotiate with the Soviet Union about the threat of nuclear war. \u201cI think I know most of it anyway.\u201d\n\nAs the owner of the New Jersey Generals of the fledging, second-tier United States Football League, Trump \u201cdidn\u2019t know whether a football was pumped or stuffed,\u201d in the words of an official from the team from Michigan \u2014 but he nonetheless dismissed the suggestions of the coach that he hired while drafting and trading players and inking ill-considered contracts. He also, and even more disastrously, wanted to compete directly with the bigger, better, richer National Football League by playing games in the fall instead of the spring, and he didn\u2019t want to wait\u2014even after outside consultants penned a report recommending that the USFL stick with the spring slate, and slow, steady growth. Trump, however, convinced enough of his fellow owners it was \u201cbullshit.\u201d And the decision he drove to challenge the NFL in court did more than just tank. It killed the league for good. That was in 1986.\n\nA couple years later, shunning the guidance of his two closest, most trusted attorneys, a manic, acquisitive Trump bought the Eastern Airlines Shuttle for $365 million \u2014 a sum industry analysts and even the airline itself considered excessive. Trump renamed it the Trump Shuttle. The result was a debt-beset debacle.\n\nIn Atlantic City, in the \u201980s and through the \u201990s, Trump flouted the counsel of outside analysts like Marvin Roffman, in-house advisers and his own executives who told him he was growing too much, too fast and with too much debt. Instead of combining and streamlining the efforts of his three casinos and leaning on the principles of economies of scale, Trump, in effect, turned his casinos on each other, fostering conflict within his own ranks and earning a reputation among industry watchers for a management style defined by chaos. One dubbed it \u201cdisorganized crime,\u201d according to David Cay Johnston\u2019s book \"Temples of Chance.\" Trump wanted to do what Trump wanted to do. \u201cYou just couldn\u2019t talk to Donald,\u201d one of his higher-ups said at the time. \u201cHe would not listen to advice from his executives.\u201d\n\nIn every one of these instances, Trump paid a price, at least in the short term \u2014 multiple corporate bankruptcies and very nearly personal financial ruin. Ultimately, though, he was stalled but not stained \u2014 and definitely not stopped. The headlines, no matter what they said, still made him more and more famous. And what often exasperated his staffers and minders and critics in the circles of the social and financial elite also didn\u2019t lose him any fans.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s worked for him,\u201d granted Nobles, the Trump Shuttle president. \u201cYou can\u2019t argue with the man\u2019s success.\u201d\n\nThe spotlight, after all, led to \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d which led to his turn toward politics, which led to the Oval Office.\n\nHe frequently cites his smarts \u2014 \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s very, very large brain,\u201d as he once put it. A self-styled expert on topics ranging from technology to the weather to all types of medical matters, Trump is especially attuned, too, to what his base craves. The base wanted hydroxychloroquine from the start. And the base wants it still. And Trump is well aware. \u201cIt\u2019s what every pitchman has always done,\u201d former Trump publicist Alan Marcus once told me. \u201cTell the people what they want to hear.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve received a lot of positive letters and it seems to have an impact,\u201d he said Monday in the White House. \u201cAnd maybe it does; maybe it doesn\u2019t. But if it doesn\u2019t, you\u2019re not going to get sick or die. This is a \u2014 a pill that\u2019s been used to a long time \u2014 for 30, 40 years on the malaria, and on lupus, too, and even on arthritis, I guess, from what I understand.\u201d\n\nHe said he\u2019d been taking it for about a week and half.\n\n\u201cAnd I\u2019m still here,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m still here.\u201d\n\nNot everybody who\u2019s known him through the years thinks he\u2019s telling the truth.\n\n\u201cNot a chance,\u201d said Res, the former executive vice president. \u201cI don\u2019t think he would subject himself to any potential harm. He wants everyone to think he\u2019s taking it and to think everything he has said all along about it has been right. That\u2019s what he wants. That\u2019s why he\u2019s saying he\u2019s taking it.\u201d\n\nLouise Sunshine, though, another former Trump Organization executive vice president, thinks he is. I asked her why. She\u2019s known Trump for almost 50 years. Because one of his West Wing valets tested positive for the virus, she said. Because the vice president\u2019s spokeswoman tested positive.\n\n\u201cBecause,\u201d Sunshine said, \u201che\u2019s scared.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhether he\u2019s taking it or not,\u201d Trump biographer Tim O\u2019Brien told me Tuesday evening, \u201cI think he has two goals here. One is to distract. And in addition to distraction, he is also a very desperate man who\u2019s trying to control something he can\u2019t control \u2014 the coronavirus and its economic effects \u2014 and there\u2019s a clock ticking in the back of his mind. And he said in the earliest stages of this that it\u2019ll be like a miracle. It goes away. And so now he\u2019s buying into miracles, and he wants other people to buy into it, too.\u201d\n\nTrump, in O\u2019Brien\u2019s estimation, is taking hydroxochloroquine, or is saying that he is, for the same reason he\u2019s refused so far to wear a mask. \u201cIt involves,\u201d O\u2019Brien said, \u201cconceding to expertise.\u201d\n\n**For the latest information and analysis on COVID-19 and its global implications sign up for POLITICO's Daily Coronavirus Update or update your preferences.**", "link": "https://www.politico.eu/article/coronavirus-the-reason-donald-trump-will-take-a-pill-but-not-advice/", "published": "2020-05-20T10:43:59+00:00", "author": ["Michael Kruse", "Sarah Wheaton", "Tina Nguyen"]}, {"title": "Italian PM: Franco-German recovery deal is not enough", "text": "Giuseppe Conte is the prime minister of Italy.\n\nROME \u2014 The French and German proposal for a \u20ac500 billion coronavirus recovery fund is a bold and significant step toward a common European Union response to the pandemic that has devastated the continent. But it\u2019s also only just that: a step.\n\nIf we are to overcome this crisis together, as a union of common interests and common values, much more needs to be done.\n\nBy dint of misfortune, Italy has the longest experience on the Continent in confronting the coronavirus. When the pandemic reached Europe, my country was hit the first and the hardest.\n\nWith none of our neighbors to look to for guidance, we had to craft a response to an unprecedented shock, constructing our strategy as we learned more about the virus. We acted resolutely, basing our actions on scientific evidence, and our experience has served as an example for the many other countries that were hit by the virus after us.\n\nOne of the most important lessons of the crisis is that this is a shock that is shaking not just health care systems, but also our economies and societies. It is upending deeply rooted habits, disrupting entire industries and forcing restrictions on personal liberties never seen in a democracy during peacetime.\n\nBy its nature, the coronavirus crisis is a symmetric shock, affecting all countries and regions, that cannot be effectively faced by individual countries alone.\n\nIt has quickly become clear that the economic cost of this pandemic is going to be as unprecedented as its impact to public health, putting in danger not just jobs and business in EU member countries but also threatening the fundamental pillars of our union, starting with the single market and the supply chains it facilitates.\n\nBy its nature, the coronavirus crisis is a symmetric shock, affecting all countries and regions, that cannot be effectively faced by individual countries alone. It did not take me long to be convinced of this, and I have been raising awareness among other European leaders about the urgent need for a coordinated economic response.\n\nThe risk has long been clear: Europe cannot afford to repeat the mistakes of the past by doing too little or reacting too slowly. Failure to act swiftly will result in a sharp widening of divergences among EU member countries.\n\nLeft unchecked, this crisis will jeopardize the entire European project, as our common market fails to keep up with other leading economic powers. The EU will suffer a severe blow, marginalizing our economic and political position in the world.\n\nIt was for this reason that I put forward a letter urging bold action on several fronts, including the protection of our strategic industries, the preservation of the single market and the construction of an ambitious European recovery fund, to be financed by common EU debt.\n\nThe letter was eventually signed by eight other EU countries (Belgium, France, Greece, Ireland, Luxembourg, Portugal, Slovenia and Spain) and sent to European Council President Charles Michel on the eve of the European Council meeting on March 26.\n\nEurope has already achieved significant results: the suspension of the Stability and Growth Pact and of infringement procedures; an unprecedented monetary stimulus by the European Central Bank; and an important agreement on three new financial innovations, the European Commission\u2019s SURE unemployment instrument, new guarantees for companies from the European Investment Bank, and a new credit line of the European Stability Mechanism.\n\nThe proposal announced last Monday in a joint press conference by French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel adds a piece that has so far been missing: an ambitious recovery fund. I welcome this proposal, which is very much in the spirit of our March letter.\n\nThe French and German proposal recognizes the importance of financing the recovery with a common European effort. It also acknowledges the necessity of taking full advantage of the EU\u2019s borrowing capacity to give grants to member countries. And \u2014 finally \u2014 it clearly links the funds to the need to repair the damages inflicted on our economies by the pandemic.\n\nIt is important to note, however, that while this is a welcome step toward the European response we all need, more must still be done in two important areas.\n\nFirst, the amount of resources pulled together by all European instruments, including this recovery fund, falls short of the estimates of what many public and private institutions say will be needed to keep the economy afloat. The International Monetary Fund, for example, projects a fall in the eurozone's GDP of 7.5 percentage points this year.\n\nI therefore encourage the European Commission and its president, Ursula von der Leyen, to present in the coming days an ambitious proposal for the recovery fund and the next Multiannual Financial Framework in line with the needs and expectations of European citizens.\n\nThis is the only way to uphold the main political goals we all agreed upon for a greener, more competitive, more digital and more inclusive EU \u2014 an ambition reconfirmed by the European Parliament in a resolution adopted on May 15.\n\nMy second concern is that some EU countries are continuing to exert pressure for a \u201cbusiness-as-usual\u201d European budget and a modest recovery fund, with a negligible share of grants. I am strongly convinced that their stance reflects a failure to understand the historic challenges we face.\n\nIf we allow the coronavirus crisis to increase the EU\u2019s economic and social divergences, we will not only fail to achieve the key goals we\u2019ve laid out in documents like the Commission\u2019s Green Deal and the Council\u2019s Strategic Agenda; we will also fan the flames of nationalism and widen long-term divisions in our union.\n\nWe are not asking for generosity, but for awareness of the responsibility we have to the EU\u2019s founding values and the well-being of our citizens, as well as the fundamental role the EU and its common market play in the success of all our economies.\n\nSplits in the EU along North-South lines have always been wrong. Basing the response to the coronavirus policy on distorted stereotypes would be more misguided than ever.\n\nOur economies are interlinked. Many countries \u2014 especially in the North \u2014 depend on this interconnectedness for large proportions of their GDP. A fragmentation of the single market would severely affect all EU countries, even the richest in the union.\n\nIn this time of unprecedented crisis, it is important to remember that no European economy will be able to recover on its own.", "link": "https://www.politico.eu/article/giuseppe-conte-distorted-stereotypes-hinder-a-common-eu-recovery/", "published": "2020-05-20T10:39:28+00:00", "author": ["Giuseppe Conte", "Bjarke Smith-Meyer", "Giorgio Leali"]}, {"title": "Italy\u2019s beaches face coronavirus chill", "text": "SABAUDIA, Italy \u2014 This beach town a little more than an hour\u2019s drive south of Rome is synonymous with sun, sand and Benito Mussolini.\n\nFounded by the fascist dictator on reclaimed marshland in 1933, Sabaudia has long been a second-home destination for well-to-do Romans, its population swelling from 20,000 to 90,000 every summer.\n\nIn a town that lives off tourism, Italy\u2019s lifting of lockdown restrictions this week should have brought some relief. But many in Sabaudia complain that the government\u2019s green light to reopen has come too late \u2014 and with too many caveats.\n\n\u201cThe season usually starts at Easter,\u201d said Rocco Gambacurta, who presides over four generations of his family at the Lido Azzurro beach club. \"We won\u2019t be able to make up for two months of lost revenues. What\u2019s lost is lost.\u201d\n\nAfter 10 weeks of coronavirus restrictions, Italian shops, restaurants, bars and beach clubs were allowed to throw open their doors Monday. But in coastal towns like Sabaudia, the grand reopening has been characteristically chaotic, with individual regions still to define how they will safely manage access to public beaches.\n\n\u201cIt won\u2019t be like other years. People are afraid to return to normality\u201d \u2014 Caffetteria del Corso owner Stefania Beoni\n\nIn a country where a seaside holiday in August is almost a constitutional right and a deep suntan is still a must-have, Sabaudia\u2019s 15 kilometers of free public beaches normally provide towel space for as many as 80,000 people.\n\nBut this year, to respect social distancing, only 32,000 will be allowed to enter using a smartphone booking app. That app is not yet functional, and tourists are currently banned from swimming or even planting an umbrella, although exercising on the beach is allowed.\n\nWith Sabaudia's beach backed by dunes, rather than cliffs, it will be difficult to prevent people simply walking onto the sand, when inevitably they fail to get one of the reserved spots. Police have acknowledged that there could be a public order problem. According to local media, only the rich who can afford beach club membership will be truly free to enjoy their summer holiday.\n\nBureaucracy and delays\n\nFor the seasonal businesses in Italy\u2019s beach towns, the ongoing social-distancing regulations and uncertainty are threatening to bankrupt them just as they reopen.\n\nAccording to the new rules, bars and restaurants can only serve customers seated at least 1 meter apart. At Caffetteria del Corso, a cocktail and coffee bar in central Sabaudia, this means they can serve only 12 people at a time, instead of 150 people in high season.\n\nThe caf\u00e9 has had to furlough eight bar staff, said its owner, Stefania Beoni. After starting her business four years ago, she was just starting to make decent returns. \u201cThis should have been our breakthrough year,\u201d she said.\n\nLike others, she fears that their customers will be too afraid \u2014 or otherwise unable \u2014 to come on holiday. \u201cIt won\u2019t be like other years. People are afraid to return to normality.\u201d\n\nAs the health emergency recedes, the government \u2014 mindful of a looming economic crisis \u2014 has offered up to \u20ac500 to lower-income families who holiday in Italy this summer.\n\nBut given Italy\u2019s history of bureaucracy and delays, many in Sabaudia are skeptical the holiday aid will materialize. Much of the financial assistance promised in March to help Italians get by during the crisis has so far failed to appear.\n\n\u201cBy the time this money arrives, it will be 2030,\u201d said Sergio Chiusuri, a day-tripper from Rome walking on the beach with his wife and daughter.\n\nBusiness owners say they need realistic social-distancing rules, a moratorium on taxes, and compensation for lost earnings rather than loans.\n\nSabaudia\u2019s Mayor Giada Gervasi said some taxes are being cut or delayed. The town hall is also planning to pedestrianize the center at night to provide more space for bars and restaurants.\n\nBut local business leaders accused Gervasi of lacking a plan. Manuele Avagliano, president of the town\u2019s chamber of commerce, accused the mayor of leaving the owners of tourism companies \u201con the high seas.\u201d\n\nDelays in coming up with a plan for managing access to the beaches will create \u201cdramatic consequences\u201d for the commercial economy, he said in a statement.\n\nRight-wing swing\n\nSimilar complaints by businesses across Italy are fueling pushback against the government from parties on the far right, for whom small coastal towns like Sabaudia have always been fertile ground.\n\nSabaudia\u2019s right-wing politics is built into the town\u2019s foundations, literally. Mussolini laid the town\u2019s founding stones, after draining the area\u2019s malaria-infested swamps. The town was built, in the Italian rationalist style, on a Roman grid, in less than a year, boosting the myth of fascist efficiency.\n\nIn the 1960s, the town pulled in the liberal cultural elite such as the filmmaker Pier Paolo Pasolini and the writer Alberto Moravia, retaining its prestige until the 1990s, since when its fortunes have gradually declined.\n\n\u201cSo many sacrifices, a life given up for this place, and for what?\u201d \u2014 Il Dollaro owner Antonietta De Blasi\n\nIn last year\u2019s European elections, two-thirds of Sabaudia\u2019s voters cast their ballots for the three main parties on the right, up from 51 percent for the center-right alliance in the parliamentary elections the year before.\n\nLast August, Sabaudia was the site of a large rally held by Matteo Salvini, as the leader of the far-right League party and then interior minister forced a government crisis he hoped would make him prime minister.\n\nThat power play backfired badly, and Salvini has since been out of power \u2014 if not out of the limelight.\n\nSince the beginning of the crisis, Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte has enjoyed a surge in popularity.\n\nBut as Italy looks to a return to normal, national political unity is fragmenting once again, as the right seeks to capitalize on worries the government is reopening too slowly.\n\nFor the residents of Sabaudia, their concerns are purely local: how to survive the immediate future.\n\nMayor Gervasi, an independent, admitted it will be hard to make up for the lost time, but said she is \u201coptimistic.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can limit the damage,\u201d she told POLITICO.\n\nAt Il Dollaro \u2014 a family owned pizzeria with pictures of former Roma football star Francesco Totti and Il Duce\u2019s politician granddaughter Alessandra Mussolini on the wall \u2014 the mood is less upbeat.\n\n\u201cSo many sacrifices, a life given up for this place, and for what?\u201d said the restaurant's owner Antonietta De Blasi. Many businesses will close, she predicted.\n\nFor now, they will try to keep going. \u201cWhat else can we do?\u201d she said. \u201cBut in September we will have to do the sums.\u201d", "link": "https://www.politico.eu/article/italy-rome-beaches-face-coronavirus-covid19-travel-tourism-chill/", "published": "2020-05-20T02:02:15+00:00", "author": ["Hannah Roberts", "Greta Privitera"]}, {"title": "Lockdown politics just got hairy", "text": "Euny Hong is a journalist and the author, most recently of \u201cThe Power of Nunchi: The Korean Secret to Happiness and Success\u201d (Penguin, 2019).

At the highest levels of government, they started making nervous jokes that betrayed their agitation.\n\nIn a speech at the National Assembly, French Economy Minister Bruno Le Maire warned France would start to look like \u201cLa Gaule chevelue,\u201d or \u201chairy Gaul\u201d \u2014 that pejorative term used by Julius Caesar\u2019s minions to connote the areas roughly comprising modern-day France and Belgium \u2014 unless the country reopened its hair salons.\n\nHair salon reopening policies are not governed by unifying EU laws; there is no \u201cBologna Process.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, far-left MP Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon tweeted a picture of himself with a sad little stiff paintbrush of a ponytail and the caption: \u201cI don\u2019t get it. Are we opening hair salons on May 11 or not?\u201d The picture quickly became a meme, with some comparing M\u00e9lenchon\u2019s new look to that of rabble-rousing 18th-century French statesman Maximilien de Robespierre.\n\nThe French weren\u2019t the only ones worried about their grooming options. In an unedited, not-meant-to-be-seen version of Italian President Sergio Mattarella\u2019s late March national address, presidential spokesman Giovanni Grasso is heard off-camera telling Mattarella he has a \u201ctuft out of place.\u201d The latter replies with mild annoyance, \u201cEh Giovanni, I can\u2019t go to the barber either.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, chapeau to Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, who recently revealed that he has been cutting his own hair since university, a level of resourcefulness that may well explain why he never seems to get into any kind of permanent trouble amid innumerable no-confidence votes.\n\nIn a crisis that has put a spotlight on the huge survival advantages of the haves over the have nots \u2014 as the wealthy, for example, flee epicenters of infection to sequester themselves in their country homes \u2014 hair seemed, for a while, to be the great social equalizer. No one, neither man nor woman nor prince nor pauper, could get a haircut.\n\nJust how desperate people are feeling about this became obvious when a lifting of lockdown measures in some countries \u2014 including Germany, France and Belgium \u2014 had Europeans throwing themselves at their hairdressers.\n\nIn the last week of April, the German version of the haircut-booking web portal Treatwell showed an increase of 1,064 percent over their normal level for hair appointments. On May 11 \u2014 the date of France\u2019s official d\u00e9confinement \u2014 French hair salons not only bucked their sacred tradition of remaining closed on Monday, but went so far as to open at one minute past midnight. In Belgium, some hairdressers pulled an all-nighter, working until 4 a.m. to fit in their most impatient clients.\n\nHair salon reopening policies are not governed by unifying EU laws; there is no \u201cBologna Process.\u201d So far, the basic rules for Germany, France and Belgium are similar: sterilized equipment, masks, no more coffee or magazines (which begs the question where we\u2019re supposed to go if we want to read sticky 14-month old issues of Paris Match).\n\nBut if you\u2019re living in Germany, you won\u2019t have access to all the same services of pulchritude as before. If you\u2019re desperate to dye your eyebrows, your only option is to hitch an illegal ride across the border. You\u2019ll also have to shampoo your own hair at the salon before getting it cut, whether you already washed it at home or not.\n\nBut for all their impatience, Europeans have viewed temporary hirsutism as a necessary evil for which regimes and governments cannot reasonably be blamed. Broadly speaking, the mentality is one of people versus the virus.\n\nNot so in the United States, where the people\u2019s right to a haircut has become a three-way proxy war between state governments struggling to enforce lockdowns, right-wing extremists who feel that access to barbers is an inalienable right (next time you see a photo of anti-lockdown protesters, look for the signs among the guns saying \u201cWE WANT HAIRCUTS\u201d), and people on the left opposed to making low-paid workers like barbers to expose themselves to danger.\n\nSo absurd has this haircut war become that in Lansing, Michigan, a group calling itself the Michigan Conservative Coalition held a demonstration called \u201cOperation Haircut,\u201d in which they defied lockdown by \u2026 giving free haircuts on the lawn of the state capital building. (I wasn\u2019t there, but I have a feeling it wasn\u2019t as rousing as the organizers imagined. An outdoor trim isn\u2019t exactly Henry V\u2019s St Crispin\u2019s Day speech.)\n\nWhat is it about the lack of haircuts that pushes people over the edge?

It\u2019s very problematic,\u201d said Tom\u00e1\u0161 Zdechovsk\u00fd, a Czech lawmaker for the European People\u2019s Party who drafted the resolution. \u201cThere needs to be full transparency.\u201d\n\nThe warning from Parliament comes at a critical moment for the EU\u2019s highest judicial body, after Germany's Constitutional Court this month issued a bombshell ruling perceived to challenge its authority.\n\nJuan Carlos Gonz\u00e1lez, the court\u2019s spokesperson, told POLITICO that the court had started to apply \u201ca more restrictive approach\u201d to the use of official cars with drivers since 2018 because it \u201cfelt the necessity to clarify the internal rules.\u201d\n\nGonz\u00e1lez said there had been 32 cases in 2017 of judges traveling with their driver to their home country or other countries for reasons that could not be specified as work travel. These included for attending private viewings of art exhibitions, as well as for health or security reasons or for funerals. In 2018, there had been 23 cases, while in 2019 there were only three. Gonz\u00e1lez said all these cases had been \u201cexceptional and justified.\u201d\n\nHe also said there had been 13 cases in 2018 in which a driver went to a home country to pick up a judge because a strike or bad weather had impeded other travel options. \u201cSince then, such trips have effectively ceased,\u201d he said.\n\nZdechovsk\u00fd accused the court of failing to reply to Parliament\u2019s questions directly about the nature of the trips and what steps the court was taking on the issue, in advance of the resolution.\n\n\u201cIt would have been enough to reply in an email. But they didn\u2019t engage at all. This is why we were so critical,\u201d he said.\n\nParliament\u2019s warning was issued as part of an annual review of the court\u2019s spending, the so-called discharge procedure. While the legislature passed the court\u2019s 2018 accounts, it stressed that it \u201cdeplores not having been informed by the [Court of Justice] of any plans to enhance the control system related to the use of official cars.\u201d\n\nThe resolution, adopted by 604 votes in favor to 78 against (with 11 abstentions), asked the court \u201cto report back\u201d on improvements made no later than June.\n\nAsked to respond to the criticism of a lack of engagement, Gonz\u00e1lez said: \u201cThe Court is committed to implementing the recommendations and to respond to the questions of the [Parliament] as quickly as possible and confirms both its openness and its determination to enhance constantly the control of all its activities.

The ayatollahs of austerity are already denouncing an immoral, inflationary \u201ctransfer union through the back door.\u201d\n\nPerfectionists will argue, not without cause, that even \u20ac500 billion may pack too small a macroeconomic punch, given the massive depression the COVID-19 lockdown will bequeath to the European economy. But as always, it\u2019s better to start with what is possible now than to demand the politically impossible immediately.\n\nSo, let\u2019s savor this historic moment.\n\nI bet the Dutch and their frugal fraternity will fold rather than die in a ditch to prevent European solidarity. Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte and Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz could afford to grandstand noisily against EU generosity as long as they knew Germany was behind them. When the tide turns in Berlin, people will soon see who was swimming naked.\n\nThe Poles and Hungarians may be a bit harder to manage, given current confrontations with Brussels over their defiance of EU norms on the rule of law, the independence of the judiciary and the conduct of democracy.\n\nBut since Warsaw and Budapest expect to be among the greatest beneficiaries of the next long-term EU budget, it\u2019s not in their interest to block agreement. And if they fight too hard, the French and Germans could always go outside the EU treaties and create a special purpose vehicle to fund COVID recovery in southern Europe, leaving the Central European dissidents high and dry.\n\nThe frugals and the Central Europeans made a wrong bet on Germany hanging tough. They are in a weaker position for having misread the strength of the Franco-German alliance in times of acute crisis.\n\nSo why has Merkel done this now, after 15 cautious years in office when she became notorious for a policy of small steps which critics rightly branded too little, too late? Even at the height of her power, the chancellor often argued that she didn\u2019t have the domestic authority to take the bolder measures that others \u2014 from Nicolas Sarkozy to Barack Obama or Jean-Claude Juncker \u2014 urged on her.\n\nFirst, her sure-handed management of the coronavirus crisis has given her a massive new injection of political capital, with a stratospheric domestic approval ratings, which she can afford to spend in her final year or so in office. She has nothing much to lose. Her Social Democratic coalition partners, and the Greens opposition party, are likely to back her decision.\n\nSecond, the coronavirus is such a different challenge from the eurozone debt crisis, in that the \u201cmoral hazard\u201d argument for avoiding rewarding bad behavior simply doesn\u2019t apply. This is not about bailing out a country that has lied about its statistics and run unsustainable fiscal policies, as Greece had in 2009.\n\nAs Mario Monti, the former Italian prime minister, put it when Italy was forced into an economically catastrophic lockdown: \u201cThis is not about la dolce vita [the good life], it\u2019s about la vita \u2014 about life itself.\u201d\n\nThird, Merkel\u2019s hand may paradoxically have been forced by the Federal Constitutional Court, which last week challenged the legality of the European Central Bank\u2019s sovereign bond-buying program.\n\nBy giving the ECB three months to justify the \u201cproportionality\u201d of its policy, the Constitutional Court opened a latent constitutional crisis within the EU on top of all the other pressures bearing down on the bloc.\n\nIn appearing to challenge the supremacy of EU treaty law, and of the Court of Justice of the European Union as its sole arbiter, the Constitutional Court lobbed a hand grenade into the coronavirus crisis which, if not defused, could have undermined confidence in the survival of the euro and of the EU itself.\n\nBerlin was under pressure act to shore up confidence and demonstrate that it would not let the red-robed judges in Karlsruhe derail European monetary solidarity. Merkel could have muddled through, as she so often has done, by sending the court a justification of the \u201cproportionality\u201d of the ECB. The dogs would have continued to bark, but the caravan would have limped on its way.\n\nMerkel may just have set Europe on the road to the moral high ground as a model of interdependence and solidarity.\n\nInstead, she decided to double down and do exactly what successive presidents of the ECB have demanded of EU governments \u2014 and especially of the bloc\u2019s biggest and most powerful economy: use fiscal policy as well as monetary policy to fight the crisis.\n\nIn doing so, Merkel has finally delivered a German answer for which Macron has been waiting since his 2017 Sorbonne speech, when he called for a stronger, more sovereign EU.\n\nHistory doesn\u2019t often offer second chances, so we should be doubly grateful that Merkel has seized this one to lay a new foundation for deeper European solidarity.\n\nIn crossing the Rubicon of common borrowing, she has taken a giant political risk at home \u2014 one that is almost certain to land the government back in court in Karlsruhe in a year or two\u2019s time.\n\nBut she has earned her place in the lineage of postwar leaders, from Konrad Adenauer to Willy Brandt, Helmut Schmidt and Helmut Kohl, who understood that securing a vibrant, stable Europe based on a social market economy is Germany\u2019s supreme national interest.\n\nAs the coronavirus crisis drives the United States, China and Russia to intensify potentially fateful power and propaganda rivalries, Merkel may just have set Europe on the road to the moral high ground as a model of interdependence and solidarity.", "link": "https://www.politico.eu/article/angela-merkel-milestone-moment-europe-coronavirus-response/", "published": "2020-05-19T17:14:30+00:00", "author": ["Paul Taylor", "David M.

But recent polls suggest the shine is starting to come off.\n\nFrance\n\nPresident Emmanuel Macron, whose support had been declining steadily for three years, experienced a surge at the beginning of the crisis, as did leaders around the world. But since April, the number of people who trust Macron and his government to effectively tackle the coronavirus crisis has been headed downward. According to the pollster Ifop, taking the political temperature for Le Journal du Dimanche, at the end of March, 55 percent of respondents expressed confidence in the government's handling of the crisis, but by the end of April it was down to 39 percent. The most recent update of the same poll, in mid-May, when the first confinement measures were lifted, saw the approval rating rise to 44 percent. In terms of overall job approval ratings, Macron remains steady at around 40 percent.\n\nMACRON'S APPROVAL RATINGS POLL OF POLLS\n\nGermany\n\nGermans still largely trust their government to tackle the pandemic. The infratest dimap poll, which regularly asks people about the government's handling of the crisis, found that at the beginning of May, 67 percent of respondents approved of the federal government's crisis management \u2014 and of that number, 20 percent were \"very satisfied.\" However, 32 percent were not happy with the steps taken by Angela Merkel's government. That's a 5 percentage point swing from supporters to critics of the government's handling of the crisis in a month.\n\nItaly\n\nSupport for Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte remains incredibly high for an Italian politician, with 65 percent approving of his crisis management according to an Ipsos poll conducted in early May. This comes after an unprecedented surge in job approval figures for the Italian prime minister from around 50 percent in February to over 70 percent in March.\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nThe cooling of support can be seen most clearly in the U.K. where the government's approach to relaxing lockdown measures has come in for sustained criticism. In last week's Opinium poll, which tracks approval of the British government's handling of the coronavirus crisis, more respondents did not approve (42 percent) than did approve (39 percent). That's a 9 percentage point drop in the approval score in just a week. However, in POLITICO's voting intention tracker the Conservatives' lead over Labour remains at around 20 percentage points, with only a slight bounce for Labour (up from 29 to 33 percent) since Keir Starmer was elected leader.\n\nU.K. WESTMINSTER VOTING INTENTION POLL OF POLLS\n\nFor more polling data from across Europe visit POLITICO Poll of Polls.\n\nSpain\n\nThere's a mixed bag for Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez in the latest polling by the Centre for Social Investigation research institute. Support for the PM fell by a whopping 13 percentage points but it remains very high, at 74.9 percent. According to the CIS report for April, 87.8 percent of Spaniards thought that political parties across the spectrum should support the government and leave criticism for later. However, the number of those who think the opposition should now attack the government has gone up to 19.7 percent from 10 percent in March. When asked about the government\u2019s management of the coronavirus crisis, 48.4 percent said they trusted the government \u201ca little or not at all\u201d and 46 percent said they are satisfied.\n\nInternational comparisons\n\nSeveral news outlets and research institutes joined together with the pollster Ipsos to ask people in France, Germany, the U.K., Italy, Austria and Sweden whether they thought their government had handled the crisis better than most other countries. While 72 percent of respondents in Austria and 60 percent in Germany thought so, in Sweden less than half of those who answered (45 percent) agreed. With the number of COVID-19 deaths rising dramatically, only 12 percent in France said their government had managed the crisis better than other countries, in the U.K. 29 percent agreed with the statement and in Italy the figure was 41 percent.\n\nThe same survey asked people how happy they were with their national leader. The highest score went to Sebastian Kurz of Austria with 6.8 points on a scale from 0 to 10, followed by Merkel (6), Boris Johnson (5.6), Conte (5.5), Sweden's Stefan L\u00f6fven (5.2) and Macron on 4.1.", "link": "https://www.politico.eu/article/europeans-losing-patience-with-governments-coronavirus-covid19/", "published": "2020-05-19T15:05:22+00:00", "author": ["Cornelius Hirsch", "Cristina Gallardo", "David M.

However, with the country\u2019s league still playing games while the rest of the world has shut down, interest in the team \u2014 and Belarussian football \u2014 has spiked globally.\n\nIndia, Israel and a host of other countries, including Belarus\u2019 neighbor Russia, have bought rights to air matches. The enterprising team has even begun selling virtual tickets online for \u20ac25, with fans rewarded with having their pictures pasted on top of a mannequin inside the stadium.\n\nIt\u2019s a sharp contrast with what\u2019s happening in Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia, and Belarus\u2019 eccentric dictator Alexander Lukashenko has not been shy about highlighting the differences.\n\nWhile Putin has followed the rest of the world in imposing a lockdown as coronavirus cases have surged there, Lukashenko has scoffed at such restrictions as \u201ccoronapsychosis\u201d and kept his country open for business despite criticism from the World Health Organization.\n\nAnd while his nemesis in Moscow has holed up in his country estate and retreated from public view as the crisis has intensified \u2014 prompting Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov to dismiss rumors that Putin was \u201cwaiting out the pandemic in a bunker\u201d \u2014 pugnacious Lukashenko has sought out the spotlight instead.\n\nLukashenko is relishing his role as a COVID-19 denier and has claimed that drinking vodka, having saunas and driving tractors will keep the virus at bay.\n\nHe has continued playing ice hockey in front of fans, and upstaged Putin by holding a live military parade \u2014 with thousands of soldiers and elderly veterans of the war \u2014 to commemorate the Soviet Union\u2019s victory over Nazi Germany on May 9, while neighboring Russia canceled its celebrations.\n\n\u201cIn this insane, disoriented world there will be people who condemn us \u2026 but we had no choice,\u201d Lukashenko declared defiantly at the parade, as thousands of spectators without masks thronged the bleachers. \u201cLet the parade in Minsk today be the only one in the post-Soviet world.\u201d\n\nAnd while Putin has taken the sane course and recommended that Russians \u201cstay home\u201d to save lives, Lukashenko is relishing his role as a COVID-19 denier and has claimed that drinking vodka, having saunas and driving tractors will keep the virus at bay.\n\nFor now at least, Lukashenko\u2019s exhortations that it\u2019s better to \u201cdie on your feet than live on your knees\u201d seems to be reaping dividends.\n\nThe Belarussian ruble has strengthened 10 percent against the dollar since March, while the Russian ruble has fallen by more than 20 percent. Unemployment in Belarus still stands at just 4 percent, while more than 1 million Russians have lost their jobs in the last two months.\n\nExperts predict that Russia might lose almost 10 million jobs because of the coronavirus crisis. And while the Kremlin has earmarked more than 2 trillion rubles ($27 billion) to support the Russian economy, economists say that\u2019s just a drop in an ocean of economic suffering.\n\n\u201cRussia has outlined no comprehensive aggregate economic policy response,\u201d wrote Gunter Deuber, head of economics at Raiffeisen Bank in a recent report. \u201cHence, it can be concluded that Russia\u2019s political priorities lie elsewhere.\u201d\n\nFear and confusion have gripped Russia as the country has recorded more than 260,000 coronavirus cases, with infections rising by more than 10,000 a day. Three Russian doctors died in falls from hospital windows, reportedly after they expressed serious frustration about their hospitals' response to the pandemic. Meanwhile, panicked Muscovites have been locked in their apartments for more than six weeks in a harsh lockdown that won\u2019t be eased until the end of May at the earliest.\n\nAs Putin has taken a back seat and delegated responsibility to regional governors, his popularity has hit a historic low of 59 percent in early May, according to the independent Levada Center. Its polls found that more than a third of Russians disapproved of Putin\u2019s handling of the corona crisis.\n\nWith falling oil prices adding to the Kremlin\u2019s woes, this crisis might be the greatest challenge to Putin\u2019s rule in his 20 years at Russia\u2019s helm. The vote on the constitutional amendment that would let him rule for another two terms until 2035 has been put on hold indefinitely.\n\nBut as Putin frets, it\u2019s business as usual across the border in Belarus: Lukashenko has not backed down from holding presidential elections in early August, despite criticism from the country\u2019s opposition. A likely victory there would hand the former pig farm director his sixth term as president of Belarus, and extend his iron rule until 2025.\n\nThe idiosyncratic Belarussian dictator, who is fiercely competitive with the Russian leader \u2014 and even claims to be a better ice hockey player \u2014 can be seen as the Joker to Putin\u2019s Batman. And during these scary corona wars, the Joker\u2019s nihilistic, live-and-let-die attitude seems to be triumphing against Batman\u2019s respect for human health and decency.\n\nThough Russia is doing the right thing by imposing strict lockdowns, and for once being forthcoming with its citizens about the dangers of the coronavirus, the Kremlin\u2019s still getting booed for its efforts. Frustrated Russians would rather shoot the messenger, and there are legitimate issues with the country\u2019s handling of the crisis.\n\nRussian-built ventilators short-circuited and caught on fire in a hospital in St. Petersburg, killing six patients. Doctors are working overtime and don\u2019t have enough PPE. Small businesses are suffering. Many people are afraid to go outside, even for exercise, and domestic violence has been on the rise.\n\nMeanwhile, Belarus has emerged as the Sweden of the post-communist world, and its devil-may-care attitude threatens the legitimacy of Russia\u2019s harsher response.\n\nAs Moscow\u2019s lockdown extends into the summer, and Belarus stays defiant and free, tensions are sure to reach boiling point.\n\nNo wonder an enraged Kremlin is keen to strike back. Russia has closed its borders with Belarus, even though they\u2019re part of a union state. And the Kremlin\u2019s main television station, Channel One, recently cast doubt on Belarus\u2019 low official death count of 112, running a report from a cemetery near Minsk that had supposedly seen a spike in fresh graves in late April.\n\nIt also claimed that Belarus now has one of the highest per capita infection rates in Europe. Lukashenko dismissed the dispatch as fake news and expelled the Russian journalists responsible for the report. \u201cEveryone is figuring out how to bite Belarus because we\u2019re not following suit,\u201d he barked back.\n\nAs Moscow\u2019s lockdown extends into the summer, and Belarus stays defiant and free, tensions are sure to reach boiling point. With Russian\u2019s frontiers closed indefinitely, and some driving to Minsk\u2019s still-functioning international airport to exit the country, Belarus\u2019s stance risks setting off a wave of rebellions against lockdowns across the border.\n\nAlready Kaliningrad, Yaroslavl and other regions are lifting restrictions early against advice from Moscow. Expect more trolling and propaganda out of the Kremlin against Lukashenko\u2019s corona-denying regime in the coming months.\n\nHowever, unless a huge surge in deaths destabilizes the country and leads to street protests against Lukashenko\u2019s rule, there\u2019s precious little that Moscow can do for now.

But he said the plan, if ultimately approved by all 27 EU countries, could be the catalyst for sweeping changes, including a new EU treaty, that defines the legacy of German Chancellor Angela Merkel who has said that she will not seek reelection in 2021.\n\n\"It was not an exaggeration to speak of the current challenge, the pandemic challenge, as really a question of survival of the European Union,\" Ischinger, a prominent voice in international affairs, said in a Brussels Playbook \"virtual interview\" with POLITICO's Florian Eder.\n\n\"And I think what we saw yesterday was the acknowledgement by Emmanuel Macron, and by my chancellor, by Angela Merkel, of the fact that this situation is serious.

Asked which is more important, Germany\u2019s relationship with China or with the U.S., 37 percent of respondents said America, 36 percent China, according to the survey by the Pew Research Center and by Kantar Public for Germany\u2019s K\u00f6rber-Stiftung.\n\nIschinger cited U.S. President Donald Trump's abandoning of the Paris climate accords and the Iran nuclear deal, as well as his recent threats to end U.S. funding for the World Health Organization as reasons why the reputation of the U.S. has suffered in German public opinion.\n\n\"The fact that the Trump administration is now threatening to actually walk away from WHO at a moment when WHO is more needed by the global community than at any moment in history before, I think this worries Germans and they have doubts about the reliability of this current U.S. administration,\" Ischinger said.\n\nBut he also stressed that it was important to recognize that the U.S. remains a democracy that shares the EU's fundamental values, even as China's standing has clearly improved in the eyes of German citizens.\n\n\"Making sure that people understand the difference between a democracy, a partner that is currently going through some difficulties, let me put it that way, the United States, that is one story,\" he said. \"And dealing with a growing global power like China that is not a democracy, that is governed by the Communist Party of China, that is a totally different relationship.\"\n\nIschinger also said the Munich Security Conference, which packs world leaders, government officials, diplomats and other policy experts into the Hotel Bayerischer Hof for a long weekend in February, might need to be adjusted or \"thinned out\" to address continuing health concerns \u2014 but that he had his fingers crossed the event would take place.\n\n\"I hope that by next year we can have another Munich Security Conference,\" he said. \"We'll do our best to make sure that it can happen.\"", "link": "https://www.politico.eu/article/german-french-recovery-plan-could-transform-eu-and-seal-merkels-legacy-wolfgang-ischinger/", "published": "2020-05-19T13:26:17+00:00", "author": ["David M.

Snower is president of the Global Solutions Initiative and professor of macroeconomics and sustainability at the Hertie School.\n\nBERLIN \u2014 The coronavirus pandemic will change the world, and that transformation will come with huge economic challenges. Whether we meet them will depend entirely on our willingness and ability to adapt.\n\nSo far, governments are doing the opposite. They are attempting to preserve the status quo \u2014 to keep money flowing to people who have lost their jobs and to businesses that have been shut down.\n\nSuch measures were a welcome stopgap in the first few weeks of the pandemic, but sticking to this strategy in the months ahead can only spell disaster. Unless governments adapt to the new circumstances, they will tumble toward economic meltdown and financial instability.\n\nThe ammunition that has already been fired is truly spectacular, and more is on the way, after German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron agreed to a blueprint for a \u20ac500 billion recovery fund to help the hardest hit EU countries.\n\nGovernments in rich countries are paying firms to retain idle employees and to support the unemployed.\n\nIf the world were facing another Great Depression \u2014 with excess production capacity and unemployment everywhere \u2014 such a macroeconomic stimulus would be appropriate.\n\nBut we are facing a different danger. The economic problem created by COVID-19 is the Great Economic Mismatch.\n\nEven as large parts of the global economy have been closed down by social distancing, there\u2019s been an explosion in the demand for goods and services that meet our health needs and that are compatible with keeping safe: medical supplies, food deliveries, the associated financial, logistical, marketing and distribution services.\n\nThe problem we are facing is how to overcome the mismatch between excess supply of resources in some sectors and excess demand in others. With the World Health Organization warning that the virus may never go away, it\u2019s a problem that will likely persist for months if not years.\n\nCurrently, governments in rich countries are paying firms to retain idle employees (the U.K. government, for example, is paying up to 80 percent of the wages of furloughed workers) and to support the unemployed (in the U.S. government, more than 33.5 million people have filed for unemployment since the start of the crisis).\n\nA far better use of this money would be to use it to promote a redirection of labor from the collapsing to the exploding sectors. Governments could provide nationwide support for job search and matching services to promote this redirection and facilitating the repurposing of equipment and real estate from where it is currently idle to where it is vitally needed.\n\nSuch a policy regime would help people move from the physically interactive old world to a new world in which much consumption and production is compatible with social distancing.\n\nInstead of shopping physically downtown, consumers need to be able to efficiently place their orders virtually. Maps on digital devices can link familiar outlets to apps facilitating deliveries. Commercial real estate could be repurposed.\n\nMany restaurants could be converted into delivery services and the space that is thereby freed up could be used for testing facilities, medical centers, logistical support hubs and temporary accommodation for medical staff. Theaters, operas and sports venues might launch drive-in performances and events that are compatible with social distancing (as the English National Opera is planning).\n\nSome of this restructuring is already taking place as free enterprise responds to the pandemic. On its own, however, this market activity will not be sufficient to avoid major economic disruptions, since the social gains from matching supplies and demands far exceed the private gains. Government support is essential.\n\nFortunately, the funds for such support are already potentially available through the many generous government rescue packages. All that is required is that these packages \u2014 currently financing unemployment benefits, loans, guarantees and grants \u2014 be redirected into support for hiring and training subsidies, investment tax credits, employment services and online resource-matching platforms.\n\nThough some sectors \u2014 such as aviation and various forms of tourism \u2014 will be unable to make the transition profitably, most other jobs are amenable to reframing. Even jobs that currently cannot mostly be done from home \u2014 such as food preparation and serving, public transport, installation and maintenance, cleaning, protective service, construction, extraction, education, manufacturing, retail sales, farming and fishing, forestry, as well as community and social service \u2014 have the large, untapped potential to be transformed into physically distanced activities.\n\nProtection from pandemics will likely come to be viewed as essential as protection from floods or fires, and investment in such protection will be seen as essential.\n\nNeedless to say, the transformation would involve a loss of productivity, since working at a distance requires more space, equipment and digital infrastructure than the current forms of work.\n\nFor other jobs that are more compatible with distanced work \u2014 such as architecture, engineering, legal work, office support, management, business and financial operations, arts and design, and programming \u2014 the productivity loss would be substantially lower.\n\nBut these productivity losses are the irreducible minimum cost of maintaining social distancing. The choice that policymakers currently face is between paying this cost or paying the far higher cost of supporting people and businesses whose productivity has vanished.\n\nReadapting in this way is also a smart long-term investment.\n\nIt may well take a long time before the pandemic is over, since the virus cannot be defeated anywhere unless it is defeated everywhere in this globalized world. And once this has happened, people around the world will expect their politicians to deliver more resilience to health shocks. They will expect government to allow them to carry on working, to keep the economy alive, and to keep the wheels turning, all while protecting their health.\n\nProtection from pandemics will likely come to be viewed as essential as protection from floods or fires, and investment in such protection will be seen as essential, perhaps even a human right. Such resilience will need to be built up in advance. Readaptation policies would permit us to start doing so now.\n\nThese policies also give policymakers an exit strategy from their costly fiscal commitments. Once economic activity has been redirected to where it is needed, no further support would be required. As a result, it would become less likely that the current health crisis leads to the public and private over-indebtedness that could precipitate the next financial crisis.\n\nThe lesson we should learn from this pandemic is that social distancing need not mean lockdown and economic paralysis. It is only because we are unprepared that social distancing now requires many of us to stay home. If we readapt our economies, we could practice social distancing while keeping our economies alive.\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic has changed the world.

Ron DeSantis and deliver personal protective equipment to a nursing home.\n\nNot far behind the scenes of the West Wing, however, normalcy is still a ways off. Trump\u2019s own top staffers are increasingly working from home. The White House has started to schedule more meetings by teleconference after two staffers tested positive for Covid-19, including one of the president\u2019s military valets. Aides are now required to wear face masks around the White House, and in-person meetings, if they occur at all, are held in the largest conference rooms possible.\n\nEven the White House mess, where staffers grab lunch and coffee, has shut down and is open only through the take-out window.\n\nThe most prominent office in America \u2014 with all of the testing, resources and doctors it needs \u2014 is still struggling to keep its employees and leaders safe, even as more than a dozen states reopen businesses, restaurants, parks and beaches. The White House\u2019s struggles and its ongoing revision of its health measures offer a window into the myriad challenges that thousands of companies and employers face as they consider bringing back non-essential workers.\n\n\u201cIt is impossible to socially distance in the West Wing\u201d \u2014 A White House official\n\nThe hallways of the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, across the street from the White House, are mostly empty, senior administration officials say \u2014 except for the vice president. He led meetings in that building last week in a secure room by phone instead of holding court in the situation room, after his press secretary, Katie Miller, tested positive.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t seen Mike Pence, and I miss him,\u201d Trump said on Wednesday during a meeting with governors. One White House official said Pence hadn\u2019t been to the West Wing in a little over a week.\n\nThe positive diagnoses of Miller and the president\u2019s valet quickly upended the West Wing\u2019s routines, even if some aides worry the precautions do not go far enough. For weeks, the White House appeared to take a relatively casual approach to potential exposure to the coronavirus \u2014 with the president opting not to wear a mask even when he met with business leaders and governors, or traveled outside of Washington.\n\n\u201cPeople do not feel like the White House has initially taken the threat of the coronavirus seriously,\u201d a former senior administration official said. \u201cIt is impossible to socially distance in the West Wing.\u201d\n\n\u201cEverything there is often so cavalier, especially when people are taking their cues from the top,\u201d the official added.\n\nThe vice president\u2019s staff is expected to return to its \u201cnormal routine\u201d this week, one official said, even as Miller continues to self-quarantine at home. She is not expected back within the West Wing for weeks, and another Pence press aide has temporarily taken over her duties. In isolation, as well, is her husband, Stephen Miller, another senior White House aide who has worked for Trump since the 2016 campaign.\n\nKatie Miller\u2019s positive test for the coronavirus worried other White House aides immensely because both she and her husband spent so much time in the West Wing \u2014 with Stephen Miller writing all of the president\u2019s speeches and going from office to office to cull material for those remarks. He is also close to other longtime aides, including deputy chief of staff Dan Scavino and members of the president\u2019s family, such as Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner.\n\nAs another White House aide put it, Katie Miller\u2019s diagnosis gave the impression of a very \u201cclose call.\u201d\n\nPublicly, Trump has not fully acknowledged how close the threat of the coronavirus came into the West Wing and his orbit. He and aides have been so eager to restart the economy, which they see as a key selling point for Trump\u2019s re-election, that they haven\u2019t wanted to do anything to dampen that message, including making the White House appear overly alarmed by Covid-19 within its own walls.\n\n\u201cThe country is ready to start safely reopening. The White House cases are a reminder we have to be diligent but you can continue to work safely by following health precautions,\u201d a third White House official said. \u201cWhile many were concerned the two positive cases in the West Wing would lead to an outbreak of many cases, the White House followed the Guidelines for Reopening American Again and were able to contain the cases with no additional positives. Businesses all over the country are going to have to adjust to new procedures, like the White House has done.\u201d\n\nAlthough Trump has been a cheerleader for reopening the country and has promised a stronger performance in the third quarter of this year, top economic officials and health experts spent the weekend offering far more measured assessments.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to take a while for us to get back,\u201d Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said in a rare interview for CBS\u2019 \u201c60 Minutes.\u201d \u201cThe economy will recover. It may take a while. It may take a period \u2014 it could stretch through the end of the next year. We really don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nThe president remains focused on the positive, even amid signs that challenges remain.\n\nTrump has branded the latter half of this year as \u201ctransitioning to greatness\u201d for the economy, even as the number of Americans unemployed rose to roughly 36 million people within the last week.\n\n\u201cPart of the pivot away from the health concerns to the economy comes from the president\u2019s natural interest,\u201d said one Republican close to the White House. \u201cHe is much more comfortable in the economic policy lane than with health care, and [National Economic Council Director] Larry Kudlow has a good amount of juice with the president. I don\u2019t know any of the health people with whom he has that relationship, even if he has grown fond of Dr. Deborah Birx\u201d \u2014 the White House coronavirus response coordinator.\n\nObstacles lie ahead. Many major businesses would like the next relief and stimulus package to absolve them of liability should workers fall sick with Covid-19 after returning to offices and plants. The White House is in favor of this move, administration officials say, yet Congress seems weeks away from passing another large package as Republicans grow wary of the trillions of dollars already being spent.\n\nThe president remains focused on the positive, even amid signs that challenges remain. As he spoke about the promise and his hope for a quick development of a vaccine in the Rose Garden on Friday, Trump was surrounded by his top health officials. They stood behind him stoically, wearing face masks, as he promoted the \u201copening of America.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to have an amazing year next year,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have a great transition into the fourth quarter,\u201d he said.\n\nGabby Orr contributed to this report.", "link": "https://www.politico.eu/article/donald-trump-projects-a-sense-of-normal-but-west-wing-has-a-ways-to-go-coronavirus-pandemic/", "published": "2020-05-18T10:15:30+00:00", "author": ["Nancy Cook", "Arnau Busquets Gu\u00e0rdia", "Hanna Pawelec"]}, {"title": "By the numbers: Europe on the move again", "text": "data point By the numbers: Europe on the move again Data from route-finding apps suggests that people started moving around more even before lockdown rules were lifted in many places.\n\nEurope is starting to move again.\n\nMobility data from smartphone apps shows that citizens across Europe gradually started moving and going out more even before lockdowns were lifted in many countries. In some, the data suggest that movement levels are now almost back to where they were in January.\n\nSeveral platforms and app providers have made their aggregated mobility data available since the outbreak of the crisis, enabling us to compare when and by how much people in different countries have changed their behavior. The data is a proxy for general mobility because as people stop going out to shops or bars and follow the rules on avoiding non-essential movement, they also stop using direction-finding apps to look up how to get places.\n\nPOLITICO analysed the number of routing requests from Apple's mobility reports from before and during the coronavirus crisis to reveal when people reduced physical contacts \u2014 and when they began moving again. The data on walking journeys is based on the selection of the type of mobility by users.\n\nMany governments allowed more shops (and in some cases also caf\u00e9s and restaurants) to reopen last week. On May 11, all shops in Belgium, Croatia and the Czech Republic opened up, as well as smaller retailers in France and Greece. In Austria, Cyprus, Germany, Poland and Slovakia that happened a week earlier.\n\nThe data does not show a steep increase before or around those dates but rather suggests that people are gradually resuming something approaching normal mobility. The cold weather at the beginning of that week in many parts of Europe might have played a role in reducing the number of walks.\n\nAround May 4, when Spaniards were allowed to exercise outside for the first time again, the data shows a mobility bump, but overall in the countries hit the hardest, people are still staying home. In Sweden, with the loosest restrictions, the mobility index was back at around 90 percent of the amount of routing requests during normal times over the weekend of May 9 and 10.\n\nThe walking data also reveals another trend. The difference between weekends and weekdays is now reduced with lower spikes in data requests on Fridays and Saturdays.\n\nAcross Europe, people have also reduced their requests for public transport directions. Here though, there is no upward trend in sight, with travellers avoiding taking buses, trains and metro. Routing requests for car journeys are recovering more quickly though.\n\nThis infographic is from POLITICO Pro\u2019s DataPoint library.

So too would officials from Singapore extolling the merits of a population trusting the government and marching lockstep with it.\n\nBut it caused hardly a stir at a May 8 international conference on COVID-19 when Shanghai health director Chunlin Jin emphasized the importance of \u201cauthority and efficiency\u201d in building a health emergency management pattern. No reaction was provoked either by the acknowledgement by Tikki Pangestu, a former director of research policy at the World Health Organization, of the important role played by the population of Singapore in combating the pandemic, \u2014 a population \u201cwhich trusts the government, which is happy to follow and be compliant to government directives\u201d.\n\nBecause the reality is that even western countries with the most consistent attachment to liberal values have had to operate robustly in their responses to the coronavirus pandemic. Even customarily open societies have had to accept the spectacle of uniformed police forcibly removing members of the public from beaches and parks, or dispersing cheerful street parties. Indeed, the contortions that major European countries are now going through in extricating themselves from extensive mandatory lockdowns of their populations only serve to demonstrate quite how radical the effect of COVID-19 has been in so many distinct regions of the world. As Brigitte Nolet, general manager of Roche Belgium, observed: \u201cWhen we first started hearing about COVID-19 at the end of last year, no one could predict how significantly our lives would change in a matter of months.\u201d\n\nThe panelists at this conference \u2014 from Australia, Belgium, Bulgaria, China, Denmark, India, Ireland, Singapore and the U.K. \u2014 agreed that the world is now a different place, and that the response will have to factor in the need for new approaches in the face of a disease that knows no borders. Citizens must work together with their governments in line with science-based advice. And new forms of cooperation are needed. Jeremy Lim of the National University of Singapore and former Irish health minister Mary Harney both lamented \u201cthe disappointing record\u201d of dialogue across geographies and cultures and political systems, as did Chunlin Jin \u2014 but he also saw the epidemic \u201cstrengthening the global village concept\u201d.\n\nCentral to a solution, both to combat the immediate pandemic and to build greater resilience into health systems, is a decisive health-sector engagement with digital technology. Resilience requires a new generation of data collection in which indicators are robust, comparable across countries and relevant, so they can help guide health systems in real time to diagnose, track and treat diseases, and to predict ill health.\n\nResilience requires a new generation of data collection in which indicators are robust, comparable across countries and relevant.\n\nStill, too much of the wealth of health-related data goes to waste, prompting Harney to speak of \u201ca hugely missed opportunity to deliver better outcomes\u201d. Challenges over technology, usage and \u2014 above all \u2014 privacy persist.\n\nThey were exemplified in the conference by the insistence of Joanne Hackett, former chief commercial officer of Genomics England, that the patient should retain data ownership. This was in contrast to the view from Krishna Reddy, director of India\u2019s Access Health International, that the privacy of the individual \u201cis subservient to the population\u2019s greater good\u201d, or the caution expressed by Bogi Eliasen of the Copenhagen Institute of Futures Studies over an obsessive demand for anonymity. But there was some consensus that imaginative frameworks could provide the necessary level of trust and transparency. The pandemic is, in effect, a wake-up call, said Harney, or as Reddy described it: \u201ca useful push to a systems approach to digital health\u201d. And Lim insisted that data must be given the priority it deserves, \u201cbecause the world cannot tolerate another lockdown of this magnitude\u201d.\n\nThe pandemic is, in effect, a wake-up call, \u2026 a useful push to a systems approach to digital health.\n\nResilience is necessary to avert the collateral damage that the pandemic is already inflicting among patients with other diseases who are denied or discouraged from seeking treatment during the crisis. Growing evidence of increased mortality and morbidity among this population obliges acknowledgement that if the overall aim is to drive better health, one in three people in Europe getting cancer each year is legitimately described by patient groups as \u201calso a pandemic of a sort\u201d. In terms of crude numbers, COVID-19 has caused fewer deaths than many other common conditions.

So too would officials from Singapore extolling the merits of a population trusting the government and marching lockstep with it.\n\nBut it caused hardly a stir at a May 8 international conference on COVID-19 when Shanghai health director Chunlin Jin emphasized the importance of \u201cauthority and efficiency\u201d in building a health emergency management pattern. No reaction was provoked either by the acknowledgement by Tikki Pangestu, a former director of research policy at the World Health Organization, of the important role played by the population of Singapore in combating the pandemic, \u2014 a population \u201cwhich trusts the government, which is happy to follow and be compliant to government directives\u201d.\n\nBecause the reality is that even western countries with the most consistent attachment to liberal values have had to operate robustly in their responses to the coronavirus pandemic. Even customarily open societies have had to accept the spectacle of uniformed police forcibly removing members of the public from beaches and parks, or dispersing cheerful street parties. Indeed, the contortions that major European countries are now going through in extricating themselves from extensive mandatory lockdowns of their populations only serve to demonstrate quite how radical the effect of COVID-19 has been in so many distinct regions of the world. As Brigitte Nolet, general manager of Roche Belgium, observed: \u201cWhen we first started hearing about COVID-19 at the end of last year, no one could predict how significantly our lives would change in a matter of months.\u201d\n\nThe panelists at this conference \u2014 from Australia, Belgium, Bulgaria, China, Denmark, India, Ireland, Singapore and the U.K. \u2014 agreed that the world is now a different place, and that the response will have to factor in the need for new approaches in the face of a disease that knows no borders. Citizens must work together with their governments in line with science-based advice. And new forms of cooperation are needed. Jeremy Lim of the National University of Singapore and former Irish health minister Mary Harney both lamented \u201cthe disappointing record\u201d of dialogue across geographies and cultures and political systems, as did Chunlin Jin \u2014 but he also saw the epidemic \u201cstrengthening the global village concept\u201d.\n\nCentral to a solution, both to combat the immediate pandemic and to build greater resilience into health systems, is a decisive health-sector engagement with digital technology. Resilience requires a new generation of data collection in which indicators are robust, comparable across countries and relevant, so they can help guide health systems in real time to diagnose, track and treat diseases, and to predict ill health.\n\nResilience requires a new generation of data collection in which indicators are robust, comparable across countries and relevant.\n\nStill, too much of the wealth of health-related data goes to waste, prompting Harney to speak of \u201ca hugely missed opportunity to deliver better outcomes\u201d. Challenges over technology, usage and \u2014 above all \u2014 privacy persist.\n\nThey were exemplified in the conference by the insistence of Joanne Hackett, former chief commercial officer of Genomics England, that the patient should retain data ownership. This was in contrast to the view from Krishna Reddy, director of India\u2019s Access Health International, that the privacy of the individual \u201cis subservient to the population\u2019s greater good\u201d, or the caution expressed by Bogi Eliasen of the Copenhagen Institute of Futures Studies over an obsessive demand for anonymity. But there was some consensus that imaginative frameworks could provide the necessary level of trust and transparency. The pandemic is, in effect, a wake-up call, said Harney, or as Reddy described it: \u201ca useful push to a systems approach to digital health\u201d. And Lim insisted that data must be given the priority it deserves, \u201cbecause the world cannot tolerate another lockdown of this magnitude\u201d.\n\nThe pandemic is, in effect, a wake-up call, \u2026 a useful push to a systems approach to digital health.\n\nResilience is necessary to avert the collateral damage that the pandemic is already inflicting among patients with other diseases who are denied or discouraged from seeking treatment during the crisis. Growing evidence of increased mortality and morbidity among this population obliges acknowledgement that if the overall aim is to drive better health, one in three people in Europe getting cancer each year is legitimately described by patient groups as \u201calso a pandemic of a sort\u201d. In terms of crude numbers, COVID-19 has caused fewer deaths than many other common conditions. Set against the annual world total of deaths from all causes of around 21 million, the 287,000 total deaths by 12 May from COVID-19 are, while personally tragic, still statistically hardly significant. Malaria and suicides both have a higher death-toll, while communicable diseases overall have killed more than 4 million already this year.

B. S. Haldane,\" will be published by Atlantic Books UK in August.\n\nCAMBRIDGE, England \u2014 All over Europe, 5G telephone towers are being set on fire. At least 16 masts in the Netherlands have gone up in flames. There have been attacks on 5G equipment in Italy, Ireland, Belgium and Cyprus. The United Kingdom, ever-keen to outperform the Continent, has witnessed more than 60 such acts of arson. A video showed a tower lit up in Birmingham one night in early April. It burned tall and bright, as if a giant Olympic torch had been planted into the middle of the city.\n\nThe vandals draw from a sludge of absurd theories to explain their motivations: that 5G masts somehow spread the coronavirus, or that the radiation from these towers weakens our immune systems, laying us bare to COVID-19. Or even that there is no COVID-19 at all, that the disease is a myth to explain the worst effects of 5G rays. In the U.K., conspiracists have spotted a 5G tower in the new \u00a320 note and decided that it\u2019s some kind of coded message; in fact, it\u2019s only the lighthouse in Margate, the town so dear to J. M. W. Turner, the artist on the note.\n\nHealth authorities have gone blue in the face insisting that 5G technology hasn\u2019t been proven to cause any danger to anyone. It hasn\u2019t mattered. The attackers have grown in number and kept at it. On Facebook, one member of an anti-5G group linked to YouTube footage of a tower in flames, and wrote: \u201cAND SO THE FIGHT BEGAN.\u201d\n\nThese acts feel as if they\u2019ve been imported from the past, and not just because of the atavism of destroying mankind\u2019s newest technology with mankind\u2019s oldest. Even the operating logic is medieval. Surely in well-educated Europe, plumb in the middle of the Information Age, no one should be buying these flimsy theories and marching off, petrol bombs in hand, to incinerate mobile towers?\n\nPoliticians in Europe and the United States have fed the anxieties of their citizens as well.\n\nHistory supplies a sharp parallel. Beginning in the middle of the 16th century, tens of thousands of men and women \u2014 women, for the most part \u2014 were killed for being witches. There had been similar executions before, but they took on new momentum around 1550, in the full flower of the Renaissance and all its attendant emphasis on rationality. Many of these people were burned; as with the 5G towers, the spectacle of destruction seemed as vital as the destruction itself. In 1613, for instance, at least 40 people in the southern Dutch town of Roermond were tried for bringing about blights in crops and the deaths of livestock and children. Found guilty, they were tied to stakes and burned to death. A couple dozen miles northwest lies the town of Liessel, where a cell phone tower was set alight in April.\n\nIt\u2019s tempting to compare the material conditions of that bygone Europe with those of Europe today, and to find in those conditions some common origins for these infernal impulses.\n\nThe 16th century, too, was a time of immense flux. The climate had been shifting; a Little Ice Age was digging in, and Europe was hit by droughts and poor harvests. The plague was always around; a fierce flare of disease set in around Roermond in 1613, just when its authorities were conducting their witch trials.\n\nThe old, stable orders of society were breaking down. The Catholic Church was being challenged; feudalism was crumbling. The upheavals unsettled everyone. \u201cImmense sadness and a feeling of doom pervaded the land,\u201d the scholar Robert D. Anderson wrote. Historical concordances are always inexact, but the tenor of that time sounds acutely familiar to us. In both these periods of turbulence, people looked for someone to blame.\n\nBut the selection of scapegoats is a directed process, not a spontaneous one. It\u2019s an exercise of power, and an abuse of it.\n\nAt the local level, the rich forestalled the rebellions of the poor by channeling their fear and anger toward purported witches. Across the Continent, the Catholic and Protestant churches were tussling for what two economists recently called \u201creligious market share,\u201d and the clerics of these two churches, each trying to claim the higher spiritual ground, promoted witch-hunting as a Christian activity. In Germany, where the contest between the churches grew most heated, at least 25,000 people were executed for witchcraft between 1500 and 1782.\n\nKings hired witch-hunters to preserve their power; demonologists climbed into official posts and used them to enlarge their line of work. One Catholic clergyman put out propaganda: a handbook on how to identify witches and what to do with them. The thing to do, he advised, was to use \u201cgreen wood for the slow burning of the grossly impenitent.\u201d\n\nThis is where the real echo lies \u2014 in the interests that drive the irrational mistrust of 5G towers.\n\nAs part of Moscow\u2019s campaign to disrupt Western societies, Russian media outlets have been stoking 5G alarm with a flood of false facts, calling the technology a bearer of \u201cwireless cancer.\u201d Companies like Facebook and YouTube have been content to let wild plans for arson remain on their platforms for weeks. The irony is, of course, unmissable: These plans target the telecoms towers that are the very infrastructure of not only the Information Age but the Misinformation Age.\n\nPoliticians in Europe and the United States have fed the anxieties of their citizens as well. They\u2019ve demonized Huawei, the Chinese company that builds 5G networks, and they\u2019ve demonized China itself, for being the source of the coronavirus. And through their own lies and negligence, they\u2019ve contributed more broadly to the formation of our polarized, suspicious, misinformed moment.\n\nThe historian Stuart Clark, in writing about witch trials, called them the product of an \u201cage of cognitive extremism,\u201d in which any contrarian idea was quickly labeled as the work of the devil. Rinse the religion out of that description, and it can be applied neatly to our world today. The firebugs going after 5G masts prove an essential and dangerous political truth.

It has thrown the country into economic crisis, further polarized Spain\u2019s already tribal politics and put several regions\u2019 relationships with Madrid under strain.\n\nHaving claimed over 26,000 lives in Spain, the coronavirus now appears to be more under control and the country is embarking on a cautious, three-phase lifting of its tight lockdown. In order to coordinate both the lockdown and its easing, S\u00e1nchez introduced a state of emergency in mid-March, which he has asked Congress to extend every two weeks.\n\n\u201cIn these eight weeks, Spain has proved itself to be more than the sum of its 47 million inhabitants,\u201d the Socialist prime minister said on May 9, as he announced his intention to request yet another extension.\n\nHe also called for Spaniards to \u201cmaintain our unity so we can keep advancing.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe government has centralized all its decisions, presenting itself as the only manager of this crisis\u201d \u2014 Llu\u00eds Orriols, political scientist\n\nBut the four parliamentary votes on the state of emergency demonstrate how difficult it has been for S\u00e1nchez to maintain political unity during the crisis. His first proposed extension received the backing of 321 lawmakers, dropping to 270 in the next vote, then 269, followed by 178 votes on May 6.\n\nThe fiercest criticism of S\u00e1nchez\u2019s performance has come from the political right, particularly the far-right Vox and the main opposition Popular Party (PP). Vox has been demanding that the government resign and has filed a lawsuit against the use of the state of emergency before the Constitutional Court. The PP, meanwhile, has accused S\u00e1nchez of hiding the real number of deaths caused by the virus and of lurching toward Venezuela-style populism with his economic policies.\n\nIn one parliamentary debate, PP leader Pablo Casado told S\u00e1nchez: \u201cYour government is the Titanic, but don\u2019t expect us to be your orchestra.\u201d\n\nSuch politicization of the crisis contrasts with neighboring Portugal, where Prime Minister Ant\u00f3nio Costa has enjoyed warm support from the opposition.\n\nThe hostility can also be seen out on the street, where the daily applause for Spain\u2019s health care workers from balconies and windows is followed, in some areas, by caceroladas \u2014 the banging of pots and pans in protest against the government.\n\nTo an extent, this reflects the long-standing antagonism between left and right in Spanish politics. But there's more to it than that. The precarious nature of the minority administration, a coalition between S\u00e1nchez\u2019s Socialist Party (PSOE) and Unidas Podemos (UP) to its left, encourages a belligerent approach by the opposition, said Llu\u00eds Orriols, a political scientist at Carlos III University in Madrid.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a government with parliamentary weaknesses and that means that opposition parties don\u2019t see it as a long-term administration and so they are constantly in electoral mode,\u201d he said.\n\nThat tendency is fuelled by the PP\u2019s determination not to be cast as weak by its far-right rivals.\n\nBut S\u00e1nchez\u2019s style of crisis management has also drawn broader criticism. In particular, the government\u2019s failure to consult before making major decisions has riled both the parliamentary opposition and regional administrations. Its planning of the lockdown and the ensuing easing of restrictions all took place behind closed doors, with little consultation, for example, with regional presidents.\n\n\u201cThe government has centralized all its decisions, presenting itself as the only manager of this crisis,\u201d said Orriols. \u201cThat jars with one of the main tenets of our democracy, which is decentralization.\u201d\n\nOne of those decisions, to manage the lifting of lockdown restrictions according to provinces rather than the larger 17 regions, has been especially controversial, with regional administrations complaining that they are being undermined.\n\nThe Madrid region\u2019s right-wing government has protested at the central administration\u2019s refusal to allow it to move into phase 1 of the lockdown easing on May 11. Madrid is the country\u2019s main economic hub and the region\u2019s deputy president, Ignacio Aguado, has warned that each week of additional lockdown is costing it more than \u20ac1 billion. The country\u2019s main employers' association issued similar warnings to the S\u00e1nchez government as the economy entered a two-week near-total lockdown in late March.\n\nSome of S\u00e1nchez\u2019s allies have also been among the critics. The Socialist president of Valencia, Ximo Puig, has attacked what he sees as a lack of transparency in the central government\u2019s refusal to allow much of his Mediterranean region to move into the next phase of the lifting of restrictions.\n\n\u201cLoyalty does not mean submission,\u201d he warned.\n\nThe nationalist Catalan government has been a more predictable detractor, with the region\u2019s president, Quim Torra, constantly querying S\u00e1nchez\u2019s lockdown strategy and claiming it is an excuse to recentralize devolved powers.\n\nNewspaper El Pa\u00eds accused Torra of \u201cmaking the nationalist agenda the priority rather than the controlling of the pandemic.\u201d But the more moderate Basque Nationalist Party (PNV) has voiced similar misgivings about the central government\u2019s unilateral approach to the crisis.\n\n\u201cThe idea that the crisis will cause S\u00e1nchez to lose support in this legislature isn\u2019t sustainable\u201d \u2014 Francesc-Marc \u00c1lvaro, author\n\nIn the most recent parliamentary debate on the extension of the state of emergency, the pro-independence Catalan Republican Left (ERC), which co-governs Catalonia and whose support allowed S\u00e1nchez to form a new government in January, joined Vox and Torra\u2019s Together for Catalonia (JxCat) in voting against the motion.\n\nThe extension was approved because the PP abstained, despite its hostile rhetoric, and the PNV and Ciudadanos each voted in favor after squeezing concessions from S\u00e1nchez. Ciudadanos\u2019 cautious support for the government reflects a more centrist tack under new leader In\u00e9s Arrimadas, after an aggressive drift to the right by her predecessor, Albert Rivera.\n\nDespite the ructions that the pandemic is generating, Francesc-Marc \u00c1lvaro, an author and columnist at newspaper La Vanguardia, doubts it will reshape the political map, because of the huge divide separating left and right. \u201cThe idea that the crisis will cause S\u00e1nchez to lose support in this legislature isn\u2019t sustainable,\u201d he said. \u201cS\u00e1nchez has been able to treat his own allies poorly because he knows that whatever happens, they\u2019re not going to help Casado instead.\u201d\n\nAlthough ERC, for example, has voted against S\u00e1nchez\u2019s state of emergency, it is unlikely to snub the central government altogether, given that the two have recently embarked on talks aimed at solving the Catalan conundrum.\n\nBut what this crisis has also underlined are the limits of Spain\u2019s existing territorial system, established as the country made the transition to democracy four decades ago. As the unprecedented emergency has unfolded over recent weeks, Madrid\u2019s centralizing instinct when under pressure has been as visible as ever.\n\nThe Spanish periphery \u2014 including Catalonia, the Basque Country and Valencia \u2014 which has traditionally strained against the country\u2019s centralizing conservative forces has this time been reined in by the most leftist government of the modern era.", "link": "https://www.politico.eu/article/coronavirus-makes-everything-worse-for-pedro-sanchez/", "published": "2020-05-18T02:04:16+00:00", "author": ["Guy Hedgecoe", "Cristina Gallardo", "Arnau Busquets Gu\u00e0rdia", "Hanna Pawelec"]}, {"title": "Italy\u2019s \u2018boys\u2019 club\u2019 politics shuts women out of coronavirus debate", "text": "MILAN \u2014 Women are overwhelmingly on the frontlines of the coronavirus pandemic.

But the lack of clarity on what the new arrangement will look like has left many parents wondering how they will go back to work if their kids aren\u2019t in school all day.\n\nIn many families, deprived by the coronavirus of being able to rely on grandparents, the burden of child care will fall to women, who are still most often the primary caregivers in Italy, exacerbating existing inequalities.\n\n\u201cI understand the difficulties of having to manage a historical moment like this, but it seems like we are being driven with one eye shut, with no long-term project in sight,\u201d Serio said. \u201cAt some point you have to choose a path.\u201d\n\nGiovanna Iannantuoni, dean of Universit\u00e0 Bicocca, Milan\n\nGiovanna Iannantuoni, one of only five female university deans in Italy, knows exactly what she would have said, had she been asked to contribute to the debate.\n\n\u201cI would have recommended using the university laboratories to do mass swab testing and make serological kits for the population, because testing is essential,\u201d she said. \u201cOur laboratories were never called on.\u201d\n\nNow that tests are more widely available, Universit\u00e0 Bicocca is the first university in Italy to test all of its employees \u2014 more than 2,000 people.\n\n\u201cI went out of my way to start \u2018Phase Two\u2019 by making those who work with me safe,\u201d said Iannantuoni. \u201cA woman\u2019s approach? Well, I\u2019m proud of it. It\u2019s a way of taking care of our community and [protecting] others from unnecessary risks.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need to rethink the social model in which we live\u201d \u2014 Giovanna Iannantuoni\n\nExcluding women from discussions on how to move the country out of lockdown \u2014 and what life will look like on the other side \u2014 makes no sense, said Iannantuoni, who said she hopes politicians will put the well-being of citizens at the center of the debate.\n\n\u201cStarting at my university, I would like to build workplaces with flexible policies, capable of reconciling working life with private life,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWe need to rethink the social model in which we live,\u201d she added. \u201cIt takes courage to unhinge cultural assumptions, and courage is often a woman\u2019s virtue.\u201d\n\nEmanuela Girardi, founder of the nonprofit Pop AI, Turin\n\nEmanuela Girardi became one of the main promoters of the \u201cDateci Voce\u201d initiative when she realized the government would not notice the absence of women\u2019s perspectives unless it was confronted with its own biases.\n\n\u201cIt all started in a chat with some girlfriends,\u201d said Girardi, an artificial intelligence expert who is also a mother of three. \u201cAfter the announcement of the task force dedicated to rethinking the future of Italy, for the umpteenth time in this emergency it was clear to us that our politicians do not consider women.\u201d\n\nA major issue that has been ignored, she said, is the fact that Italy has one of the lowest rates of female employment in Europe \u2014 50 percent. That means that, under the government\u2019s new measures, 72 percent of the approximately 4 million people returning to work in this next phase of lockdown are men.\n\n\u201cThey can go back to work because at home they have a wife, a partner, that takes care of the children,\u201d said Girardi.\n\nItaly needs to be making it possible for women to work outside the home, she said. Those in power have to understand that \u201cgender equality makes sense, it increases the GDP of the country and contributes to the development of the economy.\u201d\n\nTo advance that goal, the government should also introduce legislation to ensure gender balance in institutions and expert groups that design legislation, said Girardi, who is a member of the ministry of economic development\u2019s expert group on artificial intelligence.\n\nAlthough she has \u201calways been against \u2018pink quotas,\u2019\u201d Girardi said she now thinks they may be the only way to make tangible progress in a \u201cmale system\u201d and make sure women are heard.\n\nPaola Pedrini, general practitioner, Bergamo\n\nAlthough Paola Pedrini represents family doctors in the region of Lombardy \u2014 the most severely affected by the outbreak \u2014 the government didn\u2019t seem particularly interested in her insight on the situation, she said.\n\n\u201cNobody ever called me from the government to ask me for information, only the mayor of Milan, Beppe Sala, did once,\u201d said Pedrini, the Italian Federation of General Practitioners\u2019 sole female regional director among 19 men.\n\nShe said she would have pushed the issue of lacking personal protective equipment in hospitals, advised against clogging emergency rooms and emphasized the need for more \u201cat home\u201d diagnostic tools. Having a team of people equipped to carry out tests outside hospitals and advise people on self-isolating would undoubtedly have saved lives, she added.\n\nInstead of listening to doctors, the government \u201clistened to the entrepreneurs,\u201d who resisted turning cities like Bergamo into \u201cred zones,\u201d she said.\n\nIf she was involved in current discussions, she would advise against moving into the next phase of lockdown at all.\n\n\u201cWe are not able to immediately isolate a suspected case and that person\u2019s close contacts, because testing is only done at the hospital,\u201d she said. \u201cGeneral practitioners also still lack protective equipment, which as of now is still being procured by donations.\u201d\n\nPedrini also said she wished the government understood the importance of giving people clear information.\n\nWhen the number of hospital cases appeared to have decreased, the government called it good news, ignoring the fact that the numbers had fallen because hospitals were full and they no longer took in patients \u2014 meaning COVID-19 sufferers were left at home, sometimes in critical condition.\n\n\u201cEven now, the situation that is communicated is not realistic. Those who have mild symptoms and stay at home are not calculated in the numbers, so we do not yet have a reliable figure,\u201d she cautioned. \u201cI would have advised that letting people know how things really are was important to earn people\u2019s trust.\u201d\n\nStefania, cashier, Milan\n\nSince the emergency began, Stefania, who works at the checkout of a supermarket in Milan, has hardly taken off her blue uniform.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s better now, but in the beginning it was hell,\u201d she said. \u201cWe were without masks or visors. People were storming supermarkets, and no one sanitized the spaces.\u201d\n\nShe wants the government to pay greater attention to essential workers like her and her husband, who also works in a supermarket. Essential workers, she said, should be given the right protective equipment and be systematically tested if they\u2019re expected to keep working while others self-isolate.\n\nThe government\u2019s failure to do so puts people like Stefania \u201cin a risky position, both for ourselves and our families,\u201d she said.\n\nStefania, who asked to remain anonymous because she is afraid of losing her job, also stressed the need for more support for families like hers who are struggling to find child care solutions while they work.\n\nThe government\u2019s \u201cbabysitter bonus\u201d \u2014 a monthly \u20ac600 check given to each family \u2014 is helpful, but not nearly enough, she said. On days when she and her husband had to work long shifts, they had to pay a neighbor to look after their 7-year-old son for 12 hours.\n\nShe also wishes she could spend more time with her son, and help him with his homework, without sacrificing the income they need. \u201cI feel guilty, but we need the \u20ac1,000 I earn a month, otherwise we would not be able to pay the rent, the expenses, and everything else.\u201d\n\nHer family is only getting by thanks to the help of the people around her, she said. \u201cI, as a woman and a mother, feel abandoned by the state.\u201d\n\nLaura Boldrini, senator, Rome\n\nFor Laura Boldrini, the epidemic has highlighted an unbearable situation: Fifty-one percent of the population is still excluded from the political debate.\n\nIn the midst of an epidemic, that means that discussions over how to handle the emergency and what comes next are inevitably skewed according to what men consider important, making these plans less effective than they could be.\n\nBoldrini, who is one of the senators to have called for more female involvement in lockdown discussions, is tired of hearing stories of women who have been forced to give up their jobs or whose partners don\u2019t help with child care, she said.\n\nShe is worried that failing to address the specific challenges women are facing during the pandemic will exacerbate current inequalities. \u201cWe must stem the damage so it does not become an accepted construct,\u201d she said.\n\nShe wants politicians involved in the current discussions to consider this an opportunity to build \u201ca more contemporary and just society\u201d \u2014 one where child care can be shared equally between women and men and families are supported by generous welfare programs that free both parents up to work.\n\n\u201cThese are structural changes that start from politics,\u201d she said. With only men at the top, though, there\u2019s a real possibility that the government\u2019s new measures set society back, she added. \u201cWe cannot miss this opportunity.\u201d", "link": "https://www.politico.eu/article/coronavirus-italy-women-political-debate/", "published": "2020-05-18T02:02:20+00:00", "author": ["Greta Privitera", "Hannah Roberts"]}, {"title": "Boris Johnson: I understand the frustration of new coronavirus rules", "text": "U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson | Daniel Leal-Olivas/AFP via Getty Images Boris Johnson: I understand the frustration of new coronavirus rules The British prime minister says that people find the new regulations \u2018complex.\u2019\n\nBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson acknowledged that people in the U.K. feel \"frustrated\" with new rules that he unveiled last weekend to ease the country's coronavirus lockdown.\n\nIn an article in the Mail on Sunday, he accepted that people found the new restrictions complex.\n\n\u201cI understand people will feel frustrated with some of the new rules,\u201d Johnson wrote. \u201cI recognise what we are now asking is more complex than simply staying at home, but this is a complex problem and we need to trust in the good sense of the British people.\u201d\n\nThe acknowledgement follows criticism over the way he lifted lockdown measures across the U.K. this week, calling on people to go back to work. Schools and some shops should be able to open from June 1 unless the outbreak worsens.\n\nOver 34,500 people in the U.K. have died from the coronavirus so far, according to Johns Hopkins University \u2014 the second highest death toll in the world after the U.S.\n\nAndy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester, lambasted the prime minister in Sunday\u2019s Observer for keeping towns and cities outside London in the dark over the new measures.\n\n\u201cIn Greater Manchester, we had no real notice of the measures,\" he said, adding that there was no time to prepare the city's transport network for people returning to work.\n\nThe councils of Gateshead, Manchester and Newcastle have told residents to stay at home, despite Johnson easing containment measures. Hartlepool\u2019s and Liverpool\u2019s councils, meanwhile, have said they are unlikely to open schools in their regions on June 1 as per the U.K. government's timetable.\n\nFresh polling by Opinium for the Observer newspaper suggests that U.K. citizens are also becoming more discontented. The figures show 39 percent of people surveyed in the last week approve of Johnson\u2019s handling of the pandemic \u2014 42 percent disapprove.\n\nA second poll by YouGov for Sky News found 47 percent of the U.K. public say they think the government is handling the crisis \"well\" with 49 percent saying it is doing \"badly.\"\n\nJohnson also used his piece in the Mail on Sunday to announce the fast-tracking of plans to open a new Vaccine Manufacturing and Innovation Centre in Oxford.

And the regular podcast panel of Alva Finn and Lina Aburous are joined by POLITICO's Kalina Oroschakoff to debate what works and what doesn't when it comes to improving our air.\n\nThe World Health Organisation attributes up to 7 million deaths annually to air pollution.\n\nThe topic is getting political too, thanks to scandals like Dieselgate. And people are turning to a growing number of devices and apps that tell them exactly how exposed they are to the dangers. The EU is at the heart of these discussions: a would-be enforcer that with a patchy record and oversight over contradictory monitoring systems.\n\nHere\u2019s another thing to consider: Unlike other deadly things you can breathe, like cigarette smoke, it\u2019s a lot harder for individuals to control their exposure to air pollution. We explore these ideas and more in this week's podcast.\n\nIn our brand new podcast episode, we take a look at the greening of Europe\u2019s political mainstream.\n\nThe European Commission brought together a bunch of experts this week to talk sustainable finance \u2014 and two of our reporters went along to reality-check whether capitalism really can save the planet. In the latest in our occasional series focusing on green issues, hear interviews with some of the conference participants, including the Commission\u2019s financial markets chief.\n\nOn the podcast panel, we talk about the countries who came out for and against the 2050 climate-neutrality target discussed at last week\u2019s EU summit. And away from the green theme, our panellists pick apart the rights and wrongs of the media coverage of Boris Johnson\u2019s row with his partner.\n\nThis week we\u2019re going green again: Ryan Heath talks to Kristian Ruby, who runs Eurelectric and the Electrification Alliance, a group of more than 50 organizations promoting a shift to electricity from green sources as a way to clean our energy systems. (Ruby has also been on a roadshow tour touting the wonders of electrification.) After that, POLITICO's Anca Gurzu takes a hydrogen-powered car for a wild test drive to Amsterdam (or not, as it turns out) and back again.\n\nAll the talk of green transformation is a world away from where the EU started: as a coal and steel-trading community. After the greenest EU election ever, it seems the big political question for most of Europe is no longer whether to go green, but how fast we should get there.\n\nWe also have a very special podcast panel this week. With summer holidays upon us and host Ryan Heath moving to work for POLITICO in the United States, it's the final panel featuring the current trio. As usual, they tackle a diverse range of subjects, including a tour of the world's health care and election systems.\n\nThe new episode of POLITICO's EU Confidential podcast is part of our \"goes green\" series. And the timing could hardly be better, with Ursula von der Leyen this week unveiling her team for the new European Commission \u2014 featuring a vice president for a European Green Deal.\n\nOur quartet of journalists from the EU's key capitals looks at von der Leyen's lineup (including some strange job titles) and asks: Just how green is Europe going to get under this new Commission?\n\nWe hear from Swedish Environment Minister and Deputy Prime Minister Isabella L\u00f6vin on her country\u2019s plan to become climate neutral by 2045. And POLITICO's environment reporter Paola Tamma catches up with Youth for Climate coordinator Adela\u00efde Charlier. With global protests planned to coincide with the U.N. Climate Summit on September 23, Charlier sets out what her peers want from politicians and answers criticism that their demands carry too high a price.\n\nOur financial reporter Bjarke Smith-Meyer explores whether the European Central Bank will assume a green hue under France\u2019s Christine Lagarde.\n\nAnd there's a bit of Brexit too, as our capital quartet stages its own version of Prime Minister's Questions to tackle the latest mysteries around Britain's delayed departure from the EU.\n\nSPONSORED CONTENT: As farms go digital, possibilities for decarbonization grow In the special branded episode of EU Confidential Goes Green by Bayer: The episode focuses on digital tools being used on European farms, and the new technologies that are around the corner. Featuring interviews with Jan Huitema, a Dutch MEP and farmer, Daniel Azevedo, a director with farming association Copa Cogeca, and Philipp-Andreas Schmidt, head of Global Digital Farming Policy & Public Affairs at Bayer they discuss technology, sustainability and the future of European agriculture. The panelists throw the old image of a bucolic farm disconnected from the modern world out the window. We learn about new tools that are predicting crop yield, tracking livestock and maximizing efficiency. The changes can lead to big improvements in sustainability. Listen to these insights and more.\n\n\n\n\n\nPOLITICO\u2019s EU Confidential Goes Green series is sponsored by Bayer.\n\nAuthors:", "link": "https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-confidential-goes-green/", "published": "2019-04-09T08:18:42+00:00", "author": ["Ryan Heath"]}, {"title": "Health Care 2024", "text": "Spotlight on Health\n\nWith the 2019 European Parliament election, citizens will have a chance to voice their expectations for the EU\u2019s health strategy.

They\u2019ve created misleading partisan websites pretending to be news outlets, honed their social media trolling tactics and encouraged local voters to share misinformation, including about the novel coronavirus.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a definite paradox,\u201d said Ben Nimmo, director of investigations at Graphika, a social media analytics firm that tracks these campaigns. \u201cThe U.S. far right, a nationalist and racist movement, is now trying to go global itself.\u201d\n\nThe hashtags #GetBrexitDone and #TakeBackControl started trending in the U.S., despite most Americans being largely apathetic toward Brexit.\n\nThe effort\u2019s impact \u2014 to the extent that it can be measured \u2014 has not always matched its ambition.\n\nDespite a groundswell in the volume of American-made misinformation in Europe, activists\u2019 efforts largely failed to sway public opinion, according to online campaign analysts, hate-speech experts and policymakers who have tracked the growth of American digital activists operating in the EU over the last four years.\n\nBut that was hardly the point. For the most part, these groups had another audience in mind: Americans back home.\n\nIn boosting a populist European candidate, or getting a particular social media hashtag to trend ahead of an election, U.S. activists sought to piggyback on European political debates and divisions to create online propaganda to boost their world view for voters in the U.S.\n\nWhen U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson took to Twitter last fall to hail his new Brexit deal with the European Union, for instance, American Twitter users with handles such as @2BeConservative and @TRUMPISNOW started to retweet the message, according to an analysis by FirstDraftNew, a nonprofit focused on online campaigning.\n\nSoon, the hashtags #GetBrexitDone and #TakeBackControl started trending in the U.S., despite most Americans being largely apathetic toward Brexit. The idea of a polarized Britain \u2014 and a leader like Johnson who rose to the occasion to champion the will of the people \u2014 served to boost Trump\u2019s \u201cstick it to the elites\u201d narrative.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not much concern within U.S. extremist groups about what is happening in Europe,\u201d said Chloe Colliver, who heads the digital research unit at the Institute of Strategic Dialogue, a London-based think tank that analyzes online extremist speech. \u201cThey are more focused on using European elections for their own domestic-level policy and political campaigns.\u201d\n\n#MacronLeaks\n\nThe online campaign in Europe began soon after Trump was sworn into the Oval office.\n\nIn the final days of the French presidential campaign in May 2017, hackers with possible ties to the Russian government released reams of internal documents from the campaign of Emmanuel Macron, the now-French president who was up against Marine Le Pen, the leader of the far-right National Rally, in the final runoff.\n\nWithin hours, American activists, initially spurred on by Jack Posobiec, a journalist now working for the far-right news outlet One America News Network, began flooding social media with posts promoting the hacking attack with the hashtag #MacronLeaks.\n\nOn online message boards like Reddit and Discord, which are popular among far-right groups, American activists game-planned how to saturate networks in France with fake accounts. They quickly drummed up viral memes of Macron as Marie Antoinette, the out-of-touch French queen, and shared them with local activists in the hopes that Le Pen supporters would use them in their own attacks on the French president.\n\n\u201cWe must bombard French social media with pro-Le Pen propaganda to remind the French who is on their side,\u201d read a call-to-arms on 4Chan, another message board, just weeks before the election \u2014 a post that was subsequently deleted. \u201cReally hammer in the point that he doesn\u2019t give a f*ck about the common man.\u201d\n\nFor the most part, their efforts failed to get much traction among the French. Part of the reason was the language barrier, as posts were largely in English, said Tommaso Venturini, a researcher at French National Centre for Scientific Research\u2019s Centre for Internet and Society.\n\nWhen #MacronLeaks did start to trend in France, it was in large part because it was being used by people debunking claims made by far-right activists.\n\nU.S. activists made their biggest impact when local far-right groups actively sought to cooperate or emulate their tactics\n\nThe incident marked \u201ca turning point\u201d for U.S. activists, according to Nimmo at Graphika.\n\nWhile the groups failed to get much attention in France, their anti-Macron hashtag was soon trending back home in the U.S. \u2014 despite most American Twitter users not interested in European politics. That allowed these activists to portray the soon-to-be French president as someone from a corrupt political elite and to link the scandal to Trump\u2019s pledges to \u201cdrain the swamp.\u201d\n\nThe incident proved they could hijack European events to their own advantage domestically, and it set the stage for efforts across the Continent.\n\n\u2018God of racewar\u2019\n\nU.S. activists made their biggest impact when local far-right groups actively sought to cooperate or emulate their tactics \u2014 or when an unexpected domestic European event played into a narrative they were seeking to promote.\n\nAhead of Italy\u2019s national election in early 2018 \u2014 where populist and far-right leaders outperformed many of the country\u2019s traditional parties \u2014 local online campaigners discussed misinformation tactics with American groups in encrypted apps like Telegram and on digital message boards, according to a review of these messages by POLITICO and an analysis from the Institute for Strategic Dialogue.\n\nThe arrest of Luca Traini, a failed candidate for Italy\u2019s far-right League party who was accused of shooting and wounding six African immigrants, also offered an opening for U.S. groups. In fringe parts of the internet, they promoted him as a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre.\n\nThe Daily Stormer, a U.S. neo-Nazi media outlet, hailed Traini\u2019s actions as a boost for far-right candidates in Italy. On 4Chan, anonymous users shared viral memes depicting him as a character in popular violent video games, dubbing him a \u201cgod of racewar.\u201d\n\nWith just weeks before Italians went to the polls, an online campaign surfaced urging people to put up posters calling Traini an \u201ceroe,\u201d or hero. The call emulated a U.S. tactic \u2014 which is now becoming increasingly common across Western Europe \u2014 of sharing \u201cIt\u2019s OK to be white\u201d fliers on college campuses.\n\n\u201cIf you are Italian, please help by printing out this image and spreading wherever you can,\u201d the post read, in English, though it was unclear who was behind the message. \u201cIf you are not Italian, you can also contribute by sharing it on social networks.\u201d\n\nIn Sweden, U.S. activists also jumped on the country\u2019s national elections in late 2018 when migration became a polarizing topic amid an influx of Middle Eastern refugees.\n\nFar-right conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, as well as other U.S. pundits and outlets like Breitbart, spread false reports about the arrival of these immigrants to the Scandinavian country. Message boards were swamped with posts about the alleged degradation of Sweden\u2019s white population.\n\nIn the U.S., the Swedish election barely made waves outside fringe groups.\n\nSeveral alt-right leaders, including white supremacist Samuel Jared Taylor, attended extremist conferences in and around Stockholm, according to misinformation experts who tracked these campaigns.\n\nWhen Swedes eventually went to the polls, U.S. digital activists \u2014 as well as activists from other European countries like Poland \u2014 amplified incorrect claims made by local far-right groups that there had been widespread election fraud, according to a review of message board conversations by POLITICO.\n\n\u201cMASSIVE FRAUD!!\u201d one anonymous Reddit user said in a message chain that has since been deleted. \u201cWhy is the lamestream media not talking about this?\u201d\n\nThe false accusations of fraud also spread via social media bot networks, where they were then picked up by far-right media outlets in the U.S. and across Western Europe, most notably in Germany, according to analysis from the Institute for Strategic Dialogue.\n\nDespite the rapid spread of \u201cunfounded talk of electoral fraud,\u201d Mikael Tofvesson, a Swedish civil servant whose team was tasked with countering foreign interference, said he was \u201cconfident that the election wasn\u2019t interfered with.\u201d\n\nIn the U.S., the Swedish election barely made waves outside fringe groups. But right-wing activists concluded that electoral fraud could be an issue they could tap into ahead of the 2020 presidential election, according to a review of online message board conversations between these campaigners.\n\nLost in translation\n\nU.S activists made inroads with topics like migration, where the far right on both sides of the Atlantic share common ground. But their lack of understanding about Europe\u2019s complex political landscape hindered many of their efforts.\n\nAhead of the European Parliament election in May, 2019, for instance, European activists grew tired, and even angry, over American groups\u2019 interest. The efforts coincided with the failed attempt by Steve Bannon, the former White House chief strategist, to unify the region\u2019s nationalist political parties under one umbrella.\n\nEuropean far-right campaigners had traded gossip, news articles and viral photos with American activists on a messaging board called QEurope \u2014 a hat-tip to QAnon, the far-right U.S. conspiracy theory alleging government efforts to undermine Trump\u2019s presidency.\n\nBut in the weeks leading up to the May vote, only a handful of participants from a small stable of fringe groups were active on the platform.\n\nIn Germany, U.S. activists attempted to boost attacks on the science behind climate change being made by the far-right Alternative for Germany.\n\nOnline users grumbled that American users were posting too much material about U.S., not European, politics. \u201cNo offense, but this is a server in particular for Europeans,\u201d one anonymous moderator commented.\n\nIn Germany, U.S. activists attempted to boost attacks on the science behind climate change being made by the far-right Alternative for Germany. But their efforts, too, failed to break through.\n\nFor the most part, German voters shared a widespread belief in the scientific consensus behind climate change, according to Alexander Carius, managing director of Adelphi, a think tank in Berlin, who co-authored a review of the climate change agendas of Europe\u2019s right-wing parties. That left little, if any, room for right-wing conspiracy theories about global warming.\n\nOther times, U.S. efforts to link European politics to their world view did these groups more harm than good.\n\nIn Ireland, where U.S. activists had more success in influencing the national conversation because of the shared language, their tactics drew unwanted attention from authorities and tech companies that eventually shut some of their efforts down.\n\nIn the run-up to Ireland\u2019s referendum on abortion in May 2018, several U.S. groups started buying Facebook political ads to persuade people to vote against repealing the ban on abortion. Others sent campaigners to the streets and other cities to appeal directly to would-be supporters, claiming the Irish vote was part of a broader battle about access to abortion.\n\n\u201cPlease watch this detailed video to fully understand what is at stake in the effort to legalize Abortion by Repealing Ireland\u2019s 8th Amendment,\u201d read a Facebook ad paid for EMC Frontline Pregnancy Centers, a New York-based anti-abortion group.\n\nOver several weeks, the group\u2019s online ads \u2014 targeted at those living in Ireland \u2014 garnered hundreds of likes, shares and comments, according to the Transparent Referendum Initiative, which analyzed social media activity during the campaign. It was not possible to determine how much money these groups spent on paid-for messages due to limits to tech companies\u2019 transparency tools.\n\nThe volume of anti-abortion messages coming from abroad forced both Facebook and Google to ban foreign actors from buying paid-for partisan messages a month ahead of the vote.\n\n\u201cThere was an international dimension to these political movements,\u201d said Liz Carolan, who co-founded the Transparent Referendum Initiative.\n\nThe volume of anti-abortion messages coming from abroad \u2014 Canadian and British right-wing activists were also active in the debate \u2014 forced both Facebook and Google to ban foreign actors from buying paid-for partisan messages a month ahead of the vote.\n\nIt was the first time that either tech giant had curtailed such political ad buying on their global platforms. After the Irish referendum \u2014 in which voters ultimately chose to legalize abortion \u2014 the ban on political ads became the companies\u2019 standard practice globally.\n\nHome advantage\n\nFor all of their European excursions, American digital actors never truly took their eyes off their domestic goals.\n\nThere was no \u201cmeaningful drop-off in misinformation between 2016 and 2018,\u201d according to Laura Edelson, a computer scientist at New York University who has been tracking political messaging, particularly on Facebook, in reference to the U.S. mid-term elections.\n\nStill, the online playbook far-right groups honed during their adventures in Europe is now being targeted at the run-up to the U.S. presidential election in November, their next big trial.\n\nThe strategy includes relying on active digital campaigners on 4Chan, Discord and other online message boards to spread viral memes, doctored images and videos, some of them targeting high-profile Democratic politicians such as Nancy Pelosi and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.\n\nThe recent global health crisis has reignited such online activism, often spilling into the real world as people mobilized digitally to organize protests at U.S. state capitals against COVID-19 lockdowns. Far-right groups have sought to link the global public health crisis to long-standing bugbears \u2014 like migrants, Muslims and other minority groups.\n\nBoth U.S. and European activists have shared similar online messaging, often to attack governments and others seen as \u201celite,\u201d though both sides have pulled back from widespread coordination, according to a review of thousands of social media messages by POLITICO.\n\nHordes of Twitter users \u2014 often resembling coordinated bot networks \u2014 have also been lined up to quickly jump on the latest political hashtags to skew the discussion toward right-wing views.\n\nThere\u2019s little standing in their way.\n\nIncreasingly, political operators \u2014 on the right and the left \u2014 are moving away from paid-for social media ads and toward so-called organic content.\n\nFacebook, Google and Twitter have taken steps to clamp down on the worst offenders spreading online misinformation, including limiting, or banning, organizations from buying digital political ads.\n\nBut amid the ongoing political stalemate on Capitol Hill, U.S. lawmakers have not been able to agree on new legislation to thwart the most aggressive digital tricks.\n\nMeanwhile, experts warn the online political game of cat-and-mouse \u2014 whose goal is to sway would-be voters with a barrage of partisan messaging \u2014 has already shifted elsewhere.\n\nIncreasingly, political operators \u2014 on the right and the left \u2014 are moving away from paid-for social media ads and toward so-called organic content, or regular social media posts published in private Facebook groups to reach their target audiences.\n\nTo do so, they are relying on armies of digital activists like those who cut their teeth in Europe.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re starting to see more coordinated threats published over digital platforms by these groups,\u201d said Dipayan Ghosh, a Pozen fellow at Harvard Kennedy School\u2019s Shorenstein Center and a former policy adviser at Facebook.\n\n\u201cThis election is the big target,\u201d he added, in reference to the upcoming vote in the U.S. \u201cPeople will have had four years to determine the right vectors of attack.\u201d\n\nWant more analysis from POLITICO?

Carnage. Massacre.\n\nFor many restaurant and bar owners in Brussels, the lifting of lockdown measures feels less like a return to normal life than a death sentence.\n\nFaced with sanitary requirements that would more than halve their daily turnover, restaurateurs are warning that being asked to reopen without further financial assistance from the government will mean heavy losses that could force them to shut down permanently.\n\n\u201cThe lockdown was a cakewalk compared to this \u2014 everything was at a standstill,\u201d said Benjamin Raickman, co-owner and manager of the popular Saint-Gilles bar and bistro Le Dillens. \u201cDeconfinement is where we\u2019re at risk. We have no idea what\u2019s going to happen.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a dilemma facing restaurants, caf\u00e9s and bars across Europe, as they scramble to meet new sanitary requirements that will cut deeply into their ability to turn a profit. Many are also soul-searching about what kind of experience they can give their customers from behind a face mask.\n\n\u201cMorale is very low. It\u2019s honestly really difficult to lift your head up and say OK, let\u2019s do this\" \u2014 Benjamin Raickman, co-owner and manager of Le Dillens\n\nIn Berlin, where restaurants reopened in mid-May, the local gastronomy association called the post-lockdown experience a \u201ccatastrophe.\u201d French restaurants have said it would take a \u201cmiracle\u201d for them to be ready to welcome back customers in a few weeks. And some Spanish restaurant owners are installing plastic screens and thermal cameras that would read diners\u2019 temperature as part of a pilot project.\n\nIn Belgium, bosses have been relying on temporary relief measures to keep their businesses afloat, furloughing their staff and paying themselves a small salary. The state has also pressed pause on some tax and social security payments.\n\nBut restaurant owners are warning that if the government does not extend support past the reopening date \u2014 which could be as soon as June 8 \u2014 there will be long-lasting damage to the hospitality industry, which employs at least 130,000 people, generates \u20ac14 billion in revenue and pays the most VAT of any sector.\n\n\u201cWe are facing a potential massacre, where there are more deaths from suicide in the industry than from COVID-19,\u201d Raickman said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not saying that flippantly,\u201d he added. \u201cMorale is very low. It\u2019s honestly really difficult to lift your head up and say OK, let\u2019s do this.\u201d\n\n* * *\n\nBelgium\u2019s hospitality industry was already in crisis mode before the coronavirus epidemic forced businesses to shut their doors.\n\nThe city\u2019s first lockdown, after the Paris terror attacks in 2015, put a dent in their turnover, as people obeyed new curfews and became fearful of going out. Then came the Brussels attacks. Since then, high rents, social security payments and employer costs have kept margins thin. Now this.\n\n\u201cThis crisis didn\u2019t hit at just any time,\u201d said Raickman. \u201cWe were all about to reopen our terraces. And when you see the weather we\u2019ve had in March, in April \u2026 I can already tell you my revenue numbers for the year.\u201d\n\nLike most other restaurants in the city, Le Dillens has tried to adapt to the crisis. It\u2019s turned itself into a local \u201cmarket,\u201d where people can pick up produce, meats, wines and artisanal goods from its suppliers. Others have started offering takeaway dishes, brunch boxes and bottled cocktails. But that isn\u2019t nearly enough to keep things running, let alone turn a profit in the long term without government intervention, said Raickman.\n\nFor Denis Delcampe, the chef and owner of Le Tournant, a small bistro in Ixelles, the future looks fairly black and white. If the government sets a date for restaurants to reopen but doesn\u2019t extend relief measures to businesses like his, he\u2019ll have no option but to shut down.\n\n\u201cIn a place like ours, the strict sanitary regulations are impossible to follow,\u201d he said. It\u2019s a small, cozy space, where diners typically bump elbows as they eat. Spacing out tables would more than halve the number of customers he can seat in any given evening \u2014 if they turn up at all.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t take in 20, 30 or 40 percent of my usual revenue and still keep my commitment to my employees,\u201d he said. \u201cThen I have to lay them off, I have to give them notice, I\u2019ll have to pay them what they\u2019re owed, and then I\u2019m out of business. No question.\u201d\n\nIn Brussels, the state so far has focused on helping out bigger establishments, chains and hotels with 50 or more employees. Smaller businesses received \u20ac4,000 in compensation, which, in many cases, isn\u2019t enough to cover rent. (This being Belgium, each regional government has responded in different ways; there is no federal plan yet.)\n\n\u201cYou could say they\u2019ve done more for McDonald's and Burger King than they have for businesses like ours,\u201d said Raickman, who works with local producers and advocates for more sustainability in the restaurant business.\n\nThe hospitality sector feels \u201ccornered, abandoned,\u201d Antoine Pinto, the owner of Belga Queen, wrote in an open letter to Prime Minister Sophie Wilm\u00e8s\n\nIn early May, a group of 40 chefs from some of Belgium\u2019s most well-known restaurants \u2014 including Belga Queen, L\u2019Entr\u00e9e des Artistes and Chou de Bruxelles \u2014 staged a protest on Brussels\u2019 Grand Place, laying out their chef whites and holding up placards with the number of people they employ, next to pictures of hangmen.\n\nThe hospitality sector feels \u201ccornered, abandoned,\u201d Antoine Pinto, the owner of Belga Queen, wrote in an open letter to Prime Minister Sophie Wilm\u00e8s. He called on the government to take more far-reaching steps, including lowering VAT rates on food, exonerating businesses from social security payments for 2020, and declaring a state of emergency for the industry and their suppliers.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a critical, explosive situation,\u201d he wrote.\n\n* * *\n\nAlongside the economic anxiety are concerns about the impact on the restaurant experience \u2014 especially in places like Brussels where dining and drinking out are an important part of the city\u2019s culture.\n\n\u201cBrussels is a super social place,\u201d said Chlo\u00e9 Roose, the co-founder of Brussels\u2019 Kitchen, a popular online culinary guide to the city and author of two books on the city\u2019s best restaurants. \u201cIt\u2019s a very spontaneous city. There are always people out drinking on the sidewalks outside bars, it\u2019s very free that way.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m super worried about that,\u201d she added. \u201cUnless places find ways to make it fun, going to a restaurant will be really weird. I don\u2019t see the plexiglass thing happening.\u201d\n\nA guide on \u201cbest practices\u201d for reopening in the midst of the crisis, published by the industry publication Horeca Magazine, calls on restaurants to behave \u201cbased on the principle that everyone can be a possible source of infection,\u201d warning that the reputational blow of becoming the source of a cluster of new cases would be \u201cincalculable.\u201d\n\nAmong its recommendations: reorganize the kitchen to separate employees; space tables at least 1.5 meters apart; don\u2019t serve at the bar; sanitize tables and chairs after every customer; remove physical menus and salt and peppers shakers. It\u2019s a long list.\n\nSome are taking those recommendations in stride. \u201cWe have to play along and change how we work,\u201d said Arthur Lhoist, who runs two restaurants named Tero, one in Brussels and one in Wallonia, as well as a farm that supplies both with local produce.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking about moving tables, capping groups at four people, having servers wash their hands after clearing every table, providing hand sanitizer at the door,\u201d he said.\n\nStaff will wear face masks, but he\u2019s hoping to find ways to personalize them and make them look less severe, he said. \u201cWe know we\u2019ll have to bring some humor and help people relax.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hope that we will have a queue of people waiting to come back, but we have no certainty whatsoever\u201d \u2014 Christophe Hardiquest, ownder of Bon Bon\n\nAt Bon Bon, a two Michelin-starred restaurant in the Brussels suburbs, tables are already set several meters apart and hygiene levels are high, so not much will change beyond the addition of face masks, said chef and owner Christophe Hardiquest.\n\nFor him, the biggest challenge is not adapting to new regulations \u2014 which he acknowledged would be less difficult at Bon Bon than in a cramped bistro \u2014 but the uncertainty of whether people will want to come back at all.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m crossing my fingers,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope that we will have a queue of people waiting to come back, but we have no certainty whatsoever.\u201d\n\nAbout 60 percent of Hardiquest\u2019s customers come from outside Belgium and with travel restricted for the foreseeable future, he is drawing up alternative business plans that will allow him to keep his 24 full-time staff on board.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have to adapt our offer to demand,\u201d he said. \u201cWill people want to spend as much time at the table as they used to? I don\u2019t think so. There\u2019s a big possibility people will be afraid. Some will come back, maybe in the first week, but how long will it last?\u201d\n\nFor other restaurants, complying with the new rules may be tougher \u2014 or downright impossible.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s bullshit,\u201d Delcampe said of the proposed guidelines. \u201cEveryone knows that after two hours, when people have been drinking, there\u2019s no way to maintain social distancing between people.\n\n\u201cIf the intention is to have people enjoy an evening spent in a restaurant, social distancing is incompatible with that, because the experience of a restaurant is about human contact,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine my sommelier explaining the wine list or the menu with a mask on.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf they start asking us to wear masks, to put up plexiglass walls, that kind of thing, I mean who wants to go to a place like that?\" \u2014 Benjamin Raickman\n\nFor kitchen staff, too, the new measures aren\u2019t realistic, according to Delcampe. \u201cIf we\u2019re on full blast, and it\u2019s 50 degrees in the kitchen, and we\u2019ve got orders to fire, you can\u2019t wear a mask, it\u2019s impossible to work like that. Cooking is also about tasting \u2014 there\u2019s not one element of the food I serve that I don\u2019t taste.\u201d\n\nRaickman is similarly wary of having to police distances between customers, saying it will fundamentally change their experience. \u201cIf they start asking us to wear masks, to put up plexiglass walls, that kind of thing, I mean who wants to go to a place like that?\"\n\n\u201cA restaurant should be a place to relax,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we turn them into anxiety-inducing places, they lose their purpose. A bistro where you\u2019re served from behind a mask like you\u2019re at the dentist\u2019s office? It\u2019s pointless.\u201d\n\nThis article is part of POLITICO\u2019s premium policy service: Pro Agriculture and Food.

No interest of ours is served by doing so,\u201d he said. \u201cOur interest is in sounding the alarm when the evidence is indicating the alarm should be sounded and that is exactly what Dr. Tedros did.\u201d\n\nWHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has said the agency is looking into the contents of Trump's letter. Simonson acknowledged he wouldn\u2019t yet make conclusions on China\u2019s transparency until an independent review by the World Health Organization occurs.\n\nSimonson, a former aide to Wisconsin Governor Tommy Thompson, served in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services in different roles during the administration of President George W. Bush.\n\nChina has repeatedly bashed the U.S. allegations as a cover-up for Trump\u2019s own mishandling of the outbreak in the United States.\n\nTrump\u2019s letter has received some partial nods of support, however. Germany\u2019s Health Minister Jens Spahn urged the U.S. not to leave the organization, but acknowledged that Trump \u201cdoes have a point \u2014 the WHO needs to reform its governance and accountability.\"\n\nThe U.S. contributes roughly $400 million per year to the WHO, by far the biggest donor out of 194 member countries. The organization was founded in 1948 and has since played a leading role in public health crises, from smallpox to Ebola, which Simonson argued could not be done without support from its members, notably the U.S.\n\nTrump has frequently resorted to ending or limiting U.S. involvement internationally under his \u201cAmerica First\u201d approach. Earlier in his presidency, he withdrew from the Paris Climate Agreement and the Iran nuclear agreement.\n\nBesides the WHO, Trump also recently revealed plans to withdraw from the Open Skies Treaty, which permits open surveillance over military activities, an agreement signed by more than 30 nations.

That has led to the cancelation of freelance interpreters' contracts and left officials struggling to express themselves.\n\nA couple of weeks ago, Sandra Pereira, a Portuguese far-left MEP, told a meeting of the European Parliament's industry committee she \"regretted\" that she could not speak in her native language \"in a moment when translators and interpreters are being dismissed.\"\n\nAt a meeting of the Parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee, David McAllister, the chairman, asked MEPs to \"speak in their mother tongue if it is one of the languages for which interpretation is available.\" He later begged one MEP to \"speak in English because the interpreters are no longer here.\"\n\nDespite social distancing and travel bans, the Parliament says it has now managed to provide interpretation in all 24 EU languages for sessions of the full assembly. Gaelic and Maltese could not be provided initially because freelance interpreters for those languages were unable to travel to Brussels.\n\n\"Interpreters guarantee the EU\u2019s multilingualism and are vital to maintain the work and functionality of the institutions.\u201d \u2014 Terry Reintke, German MEP\n\nBut it's a different story for the Parliament's committee meetings, where only eight languages are available per room and there is only one interpreter per cabin, rather than two or three.\n\nLinguists are also using an app called Interactio to provide simultaneous interpreting for online meetings. \u201cBut interpreters need to see the person who speaks for real,\u201d said one interpreter, who declined to be named for this article due to strict confidentiality rules around their work. \u201cIn those meetings, we lose the context, and the level of concentration that is required enhances our fatigue.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt becomes harder for us to decode the message of the speaker,\u201d the interpreter added.\n\nMeetings at the other main institutions, the Commission and the Council, have been severely cut back, meaning much less work for interpreters.\n\nThat has been particularly painful for the pool of 1,200 freelancers who carry out half of the EU institutions\u2019 simultaneous interpretation. Many commute back and forth to Brussels and found themselves stranded in their home countries and unsure about when they will work again.\n\nThey fear that if meetings don\u2019t get back to normal anytime soon, all freelance contracts will be canceled, and the EU will be unable to properly function with its 24 official languages.\n\n\"We are confined all over Europe with no job,\" said another interpreter. \"We are wondering: Are meetings going to resume before summer?\"\n\nThe EU institutions employ 800 interpreters on permanent contracts and 3,200 freelance interpreters, of whom 1,200 have regular contracts, according to data from official figures and a Parliament spokesperson. Many freelance interpreters work in all three main EU institutions, plus others like the Court of Justice.\n\nBut the measures introduced to curb the spread of the coronavirus \u2014 such as reducing the number of physical meetings, imposing strict social distancing and resorting to online gatherings with minimal interpretation \u2014 meant suddenly there was much less work to go around.\n\nInstitutions stopped employing freelance interpreters, working on both short and long-term contracts.\n\nThe Parliament canceled freelance contracts for the last week of May onwards but paid fees for March and April. (Under EU rules, institutions must cancel contracts 60 days in advance to avoid paying in full.)\n\nTerry Reintke, a German MEP from the Greens, urged the Parliament to find ways to help interpreters through the crisis.\n\n\"Interpreters guarantee the EU\u2019s multilingualism and are vital to maintain the work and functionality of the institutions,\u201d said Reintke, who has written a letter with several colleagues to Parliament President David Sassoli to raise the issue. \u201cIt is clearly the responsibility of the European Parliament to care about their freelance interpreters as they are not covered by national measures.\u201d\n\nAlexandra Geese, another German Green MEP who previously worked as an interpreter for the EU, said many of her former freelance colleagues \"are not covered by any kind of social security in any country.\"\n\nShe said Parliament is planning to offer \"some kind of advance payment\" but the EU needs to do more.\n\n\"EU institutions should be ashamed. They say 'we need EU solidarity' but these people don\u2019t get any solidarity,\" she said.\n\nOut of Commission\n\nThe European Commission is one of the biggest employers of EU interpreters. It provides interpretation for about 40 to 50 meetings a day in normal times, according to a spokesperson.\n\nRight now, the Commission is providing interpreting for about five physical meetings per day, the spokesperson said. In addition, Commission linguists are interpreting for videoconferences, such as an international pledging event to combat the coronavirus held this month.\n\nOver at the Council of the EU, interpreting has been \"partially provided\" at meetings of ambassadors, according to a Council official. Ministers meeting via videoconference have had to get by without any interpreting provided by the Council, the official said.\n\nEven the most recent videoconference of EU leaders such as French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel took place without the Council providing interpretation.\n\nIn an effort to resolve their problems, freelance interpreters met online with the three EU institutions last month. A similar meeting is planned for the end of May.\n\nSo far, as befits their profession, the interpreters seem confident that clear communication holds the key to getting things back on track.\n\n\u201cWe are dealing with institutions through social dialogue,\u201d said a statement signed by their negotiating team following the meeting on April 24. \u201cThere is no doubt that those problems will be solved, as always in the history of the EU.\u201d\n\nAitor Hern\u00e1ndez-Morales and David M.

But in London, they are also playing a key role in a vicious drugs trade and fueling a surge in violent crime.\n\nSweeping changes to the U.K.\u2019s banking regulations in recent years pushed most dirty money outside the official financial system. As bankers developed detailed new processes to verify the source of funds, money launderers and criminals turned elsewhere to deposit and move their profits: the burgeoning cottage industry of remittance and foreign exchange shops known as money service businesses, or MSBs.\n\nIn the U.K., these shops \u201crarely ask for proof of address and source of funds,\u201d according to a money laundering consultant who has worked as a British police officer for 30 years, including 10 years on various aspects of financial crime and organized crime.\n\nA lack of coordination even among members of large money transfer networks such as Western Union or MoneyGram also allows criminals to make multiple smaller transfers to the same destination undetected, the retired officer said.\n\n\u201cThere is clear evidence to support the claim that MSBs are playing a significant role in the rise of violent crime, gang-related crime, drug dealing, in London\u201d \u2014 Nick Stevens, detective\n\nIt\u2019s a loophole that is heavily exploited by London\u2019s violent drug gangs, allowing them to ramp up their activities and leading to an exponential rise in crime, according to multiple insiders with knowledge of the situation.\n\nLondon saw a 10-year peak in murders in 2018 with 132 reported deaths, a majority of which were gang-related. In the first nine months of 2019, the city saw 90 murders and a third of all recorded knife crime offences in England and Wales, with an average of 42 knife attacks per day for the whole year.\n\nThere is a direct link between the crime wave that\u2019s overtaken London and the growing number of MSBs crowding the city\u2019s shopping streets, experts say. The city has 9,000 such shops, according to the latest data, but police and industry representatives say the real number is likely to be much higher because many operate without registration.\n\n\u201cThere is clear evidence to support the claim that MSBs are playing a significant role in the rise of violent crime, gang-related crime, drug dealing, in London,\u201d Nick Stevens, a detective and the head of the Met police force\u2019s organized crime division, said in a speech at the Cambridge Economic Crime Symposium last year.\n\nOne money service shop in London, closed by the police in 2019, laundered \u00a3310 million over a one-year period, using the funds to procure bulk cocaine. Nearly \u00a3900 million worth of cocaine was also confiscated from other MSB-linked investigations in the first nine months of 2019. According to Stevens, \u201cprincipal subjects were connected to a number of shootings in London.\u201d\n\nAs the sector grows, police and campaigners are warning that financial authorities\u2019 failure to properly enforce regulations governing these transactions risks creating a snowball effect, accelerating the rate of violent crime and money laundering.\n\nEssential services\n\nThere\u2019s nothing about Queensway, a busy street in western London\u2019s Bayswater, to suggest it is one of the hotspots for the U.K.\u2019s money laundering industry.\n\nOn any given day \u2014 before the coronavirus lockdown ground life to a halt \u2014 people of all races and social classes would rush in and out of the Tube station, crowd into shops, fast-food restaurants and pubs, chat with friends, read newspapers and scroll through their phones, as on any other main London road.\n\nAnd yet, this street \u2014 which is home to about a dozen money remittance and foreign exchange shops \u2014 is frequented by some of the most feared gangs in London, officers in the Metropolitan Police told POLITICO.\n\nSome of these shops have been recently renovated, with bright neon signs and shiny new marble floors. Some are seedier and more rundown, improvised stalls under stairwells or in the corner of shops selling drinks, cigarettes and processed food. Few bother to advertise their rates for sending money abroad or exchanging foreign currency. Their clients are, for the most part, regulars.\n\nIn April, the government classified these businesses as essential services, allowing them to stay open through the coronavirus lockdown. But for gang members in London, they have long been indispensable.\n\n\u201cGangs survive solely on money from drugs,\u201d said Paul Hannaford, a reformed gang member from London who now speaks in schools about the dangers of organized crime. Access to a system that allows them to discreetly manage their profits keeps the wheels turning.\n\nThese profits can be substantial. According to Hannaford, an addict will typically spend around \u00a3100 on drugs a day, which means an average-sized London gang can see returns of around \u00a3200,000 a month.\n\nEven after the \u201cRolex watches, diamond rings, expensive designer clothes, flash cars,\u201d there will be \u201cboxes full of money lying around in flats in London,\u201d Hannaford said in a telephone interview.\n\nThat is where the money transfer shops come in. \u201cThey send it abroad via Western Union,\u201d said Hannaford, confirming what police officers, business owners and other experts told POLITICO. The money, in some cases, is run through various front companies in low-oversight jurisdictions overseas and then wired back to the U.K. as clean income from apparently legitimate activity.\n\nAlthough a majority of money shops operate within the law, according to officer Stevens, the sector has become \u201ca clear risk, a clear vulnerability.\u201d\n\nBooming business\n\nA number of MSBs turn a blind eye to regulation that requires them to keep accurate records of transactions, often under pressure from gang members, said the retired officer. \u201cWhen you look at these addresses, the number of customers is minimal, but there are huge sums passing through.\u201d\n\nThese MSBs, which fabricate records or fail to keep them entirely, help \u201ccriminals to launder large sums of criminal cash linked predominantly to drug trafficking but also to fraud and human trafficking,\u201d said Stevens.\n\nAs a number of prominent gangs in recent years relinquished so-called postcode rivalry for the sake of pursuing profits, they have started to operated \u201calmost like a franchise, like McDonald's or Benetton,\u201d according to a report into their activity by Andrew Whittaker, an associate professor at London South Bank University.\n\nThis has made them even more reliant on money shops through which they can transfer funds between members in different locations without drawing attention.\n\nThe U.K.\u2019s National Crime Authority estimates that at least \u00a31.5 billion in criminal proceeds are laundered through MSBs in the U.K. every year, the majority of it in London. In February, it published an Amber Alert to warn registered money service businesses that serious organized crime networks were specifically targeting the sector for its weaknesses in detecting dirty cash.\n\n\u201cWe were surprised at how many of the MSBs we raided have stayed open\u201d \u2014 Anonymous police officer\n\nThe estimate is \u201cvery conservative,\u201d said Stevens, who warned that the real number is likely to be significantly higher.\n\nThe rapid growth of these money shops has made oversight increasingly difficult. But authorities don\u2019t appear to be watching especially closely either, according to Whittaker\u2019s report.\n\nThe government should be seeking to deter gangs \u201cthrough economic measures, such as financial investigations that identify illegal funds and money laundering mechanisms,\u201d Whittaker noted in his report.\n\nYet few resources are deployed to policing the sector or trying to uncover suspicious behavior, experts say. Regulators and police should go out in the field to look for \u201cred flags\u201d in MSBs, such as a lack of video surveillance on the premises or sloppy records, \u201cbut they almost never do,\u201d said the retired police officer.\n\nThe responsibility for cleaning up the sector lies with three institutions that only rarely work together: the tax office, known as Her Majesty\u2019s Revenue and Customs (HMRC); the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which oversees most companies in the finance sector; and the police.\n\nBut this division of duties, especially after years of cutbacks to public sector budgets, tends to create confusion and has seen the enforcement of MSB regulations deprioritized in favor of other \u201ccore\u201d assignments.\n\n\u201cWe were surprised at how many of the MSBs we raided have stayed open,\u201d the unnamed police officer said.\n\nSeveral members of the police who spoke to POLITICO also suggested that the authorities responsible for overseeing the money transfer networks have chosen to act with a \u201csoft touch\u201d when it comes to MSBs because these businesses are typically owned and used by immigrant communities.\n\n\u201cThey fear being labeled as racist,\u201d one detective said, asking to remain anonymous. HMRC declined to comment on this allegation.\n\nGray area\n\nPart of the problem is that \u2014 except for larger outfits that pool money from smaller MSBs \u2014 there is little incentive to comply with regulation, said one MSB director who has managed a money service business in London since 2004.\n\nThree full-time money laundering reporting officers using commercially available software would be able to clear upward of \u00a31 billion a month in transactions, or 12,500 transfers at an average of \u00a380,000. But there is no requirement to employ them \u2014 and some find it is easier not to, the business owner said.\n\nSmaller outfits also have difficulties doing proper verifications on transactions because the U.K. has no central ID system, meaning it is hard to spot the use of false ID cards or utility bills commonly used as proof of identity and address.\n\nSome MSBs have been known to use the personal data provided by honest clients in the processing of criminal money without the knowledge of the person involved, the businessman and the two police officers said.\n\nThe MSB owner told POLITICO he has been approached by people whom he suspected of wanting to launder money, and due to the larger-than-average size of his company he felt empowered to decline. \u201cIt is our duty to report these instances, and we always do.\u201d\n\nBut smaller firms, including some of his partners, are more vulnerable to coercion or the temptation of a much-needed revenue boost, he said, adding that Western Union and also MoneyGram choose to keep money moving instead of being as thorough as possible, since the majority of funds in the market are of legitimate origin.\n\nLondon\u2019s alarming crime statistics have increased pressure on the government, which has started to take tentative steps to tackle the issue.\n\n\u201cIf they get caught once in a while, they prefer to pay the fine,\u201d the MSB director said.\n\nIn order to get around the more stringent money-laundering requirements, some MSB owners register as clients of large transfer companies \u2014 such as Western Union and MoneyGram \u2014 rather than independent agents, as the latter attracts a deeper level of scrutiny, the business owner said.\n\nThe responsibility for conducting money laundering checks is ultimately on MSB owners, even when they\u2019re clients of larger money transfer networks. The larger networks are not considered directly culpable if users on their platform are caught up in crime.\n\nThis creates a gray area where it is difficult for investigators to determine who is responsible for checking the legitimacy of the money transfers.\n\nEven when investigators do uncover evidence of wrongdoing, an MSB can operate freely until its owner is convicted in court, which, in the U.K.\u2019s overwhelmed justice system, can take years \u2014 if it happens at all, said the retired officer.\n\nMSB owners also have a duty to register with HMRC if their turnover is over \u00a3100,000, and until January of this year were allowed to trade while their application was in process.\n\nBoth Western Union and MoneyGram said in response to questions from POLITICO that they have strong controls in place to detect and deter illicit activity.\n\nA spokeswoman for Western Union, the global cash transfer network, said the company \u201cis firmly committed to preventing the misuse of its service\u201d and that it educates its employees and agents to \u201crecognize and promptly report suspicious activity or behavior.\u201d It is also investing in technology to \u201cenhance compliance\u201d and keep \u201cbad money out of the system,\u201d she said.\n\nEvery single transaction that takes places via MoneyGram, the second-largest high street money-transfer network in the U.K., \u201cis subject to compliance controls to detect and prevent suspected fraud or illicit transactions,\u201d a spokesman said, adding that the company has \u201camong the lowest fraud rates in the industry\u201d thanks to its \u201cstate-of-the-art compliance program.\u201d\n\nThe company has legal experts on staff to carry out investigations into suspected money laundering \u201cto assist law enforcement catch money launderers, drug traffickers and other criminals\u201d in cooperation with national authorities, he added.\n\nBoth firms, which together dominate the remittance sector globally, have paid millions in fines in Europe and the U.S. \u2014 though not in the U.K. \u2014 for failures in money-laundering controls, and have promised to further tighten their standards.\n\nFirst steps\n\nLondon\u2019s alarming crime statistics have increased pressure on the government, which has started to take tentative steps to tackle the issue.\n\nA joint operation last year between the FCA, HMRC and the police against MSBs allegedly flouting regulation has \u201cmade a difference in the local drugs market,\u201d said the detective.\n\nThe U.K.\u2019s yearly report into money laundering and terrorism financing \u2014 set to be published in October \u2014 will provide a basis for the Treasury to assess \u201cwhether regulatory changes are required to mitigate [those] risks,\u201d a government spokesperson said. The government is monitoring \u201cthe money laundering and terrorism financing risk associated with money service businesses on an ongoing basis,\u201d the spokesperson added.\n\nSpokespeople for the FCA, the Met Police and London City Hall declined to comment for this story.\n\nAlthough authorities have shuttered several MSBs over the past years \u2014 Touma, an MSB based in West London, for example, was shut down and its owner hit with a \u00a37.8 million fine in September \u2014 experts say dishonest operations continue to thrive unimpeded elsewhere in London, despite periodic \u201coutreach\u201d campaigns.\n\n\u201cWe think the law should be applied \u2026 You have all the powers, now go and arrest people\u201d \u2014 Bob Lyddon, chairman of the Association of U.K. Payment Institutions\n\n\u201cThe sheer number of MSBs in London is suspicious,\u201d said the detective, pointing to low profit margins.\n\nFor its part, the industry accuses the government of not doing enough. More resources should be allocated to law enforcement to deal with the issue, said Bob Lyddon, the chairman of the Association of U.K. Payment Institutions.\n\nHis organization has called for a targeted investigation against crooked companies, instead of blanket raids and publicity \u201cstunts\u201d that affect the reputation of the whole sector.\n\n\u201cThe current situation is the fault of the very people who are now saying this is a big problem,\u201d he added. \u201cOur members tell us of many unlicensed and unregistered firms, and that is illegal full stop, so why aren\u2019t they being investigated?\u201d\n\nWithout enforcement, he said obeying the law becomes optional, and those who chose not to are more successful, pushing out the clean operators.\n\n\u201cIt is not in the interest of our members that there are bad actors in our industry,\u201d Lyddon said. \u201cWe think the law should be applied \u2026 You have all the powers, now go and arrest people.\u201d\n\nThis article is part of POLITICO\u2019s premium policy service: Pro Financial Services.

Critics call Wolfsen's approach to data protection unorthodox, former staffers say his management style stifles debate and activists like Austrian lawyer Max Schrems point out that Wolfsen, whose office oversees Netflix and Uber among other Silicon Valley companies, has yet to issue any big-ticket fines in the two years since the GDPR came online.\n\nAnd yet in recent months, the Dutchman's general approach seems to have won out in Europe. After initially embracing contact-tracing technology that centralizes health data on a server, Germany and other countries abruptly changed course and opted for a more privacy-friendly tool \u2014 one touted by Apple and Google as well as privacy advocates.\n\n\"We were quite concerned about how anonymous location data is, so we are glad the Dutch DPA is more strict than others,\" said Nadia Benaissa of Dutch digital rights NGO Bits of Freedom.\n\nRuffled feathers\n\nIn the weeks after his opinion on anonymization, Wolfsen tried to minimize tensions with other regulators.\n\nAsked if he still disagreed with them on telecom data, Wolfsen told POLITICO at the end of April: \u201cNo I don\u2019t think so, I think it\u2019s the same stance. Maybe the questions in other countries differ from the questions the Dutch authorities ask the telecom providers.\"\n\nThe official in charge of Europe's grouping of privacy regulators was also keen to play down any disagreements. There is \"no difference in the positions\" of different privacy regulators and the \"Dutch case was a specific case,\" Andrea Jelinek said, while a spokesperson for the group, the European Data Protection Board, added: \"The legal concept of anonymization is not an absolute concept.\"\n\nEurope's Data Protection Supervisor, who had OK'd the Commission's use of telecoms data to track the coronavirus, said: \"There is a difference between the technical impossibility of doing something to the very end, and something which we would call an effective anonymization.\"\n\nBut none of that has deterred Wolfsen. In late April, he came down hard against the use of thermal cameras to find out who may be running a high temperature due to the virus, warning companies that they would be breaking the law if they ran such screenings.\n\nThat ran against the position of the EU's Data Protection Supervisor, which waved through a scheme to screen visitors' temperatures at the European Parliament.\n\nWolfsen ultimately nuanced his position, writing that GDPR only applies when thermal data is stored. But he was hardly backing down.\n\n\u201cWe are not familiar with situations where they don't register any information or do not use any equipment that processes information \u2026 That\u2019s almost impossible I think,\u201d he said.\n\nUnorthodox\n\nWhile the Dutchman\u2019s tough stance during the crisis heartened some in the privacy community, others argue his approach is misguided.\n\nOne recurring criticism concerns Wolfsen's interpretation of \"legitimate interest\" as a basis for collecting data under the GDPR \u2014 one of six legal grounds, along with consent, that can be used to justify handling personal data.\n\nIn guidance and decisions released over the last two years, Wolfsen\u2019s authority has doubled down on the stance that pure commercial interests do not count as legitimate interests \u2014 despite indications in guidance by data protection regulators and the GDPR itself to the contrary.\n\n\u201cHis reading of legitimate interest is contrary to GDPR, jurisprudence, and guidance from European regulators,\u201d said Axel Arnbak, a Dutch data protection lawyer and newspaper columnist.\n\n\u201cIt was a surprise when he was nominated, he had no background in data protection\u201d \u2014 Sophie in\u2019 t Veld, Dutch MEP\n\nThe stance has proven so controversial that it has led to splits within the authority itself, according to several people familiar with the matter.\n\n\u201cIt is a bit of a mystery,\u201d said one former staffer who spoke to POLITICO on a condition of anonymity. \u201cIt seems to be a misguided sense of protecting people, because if you narrow [legitimate interests] down then people need to give consent, but that leads to consent fatigue.\u201d\n\nAsked about his stance on legitimate interests, Wolfsen said his interpretation is in line with European and Dutch case law. \u201cWe are strict in our opinions \u2026 but since May 25 [2018, when the GDPR came into force] a Dutch judge has never corrected us on our position.\u201d\n\nBlame the resources\n\nTwo years ago, Wolfsen's nomination as head of the Dutch data regulator came as a shock to many. His stint as mayor of Utrecht had been marred by controversy, including over allegations that he sought to suppress negative media coverage.\n\n\u201cIt was a surprise when he was nominated, he had no background in data protection,\u201d said Sophie in\u2019 t Veld, a Dutch MEP and privacy campaigner.\n\nSince then, Wolfsen has \"grown on the job,\" in' t Veld said. His privacy-defending interventions in the coronavirus crisis in particular have gone some way to winning over doubters.\n\n\"At first Aleid Wolfsen said that saving lives was priority No. 1 and that privacy is not absolute. We were kind of concerned about that,\" said Bits of Freedom's Benaissa. \"That kind of changed during the weeks ... the DPA became a lot more strict.\"\n\nStill, doubts remain.\n\nAustrian privacy campaigner Schrems said he hadn\u2019t heard anything from the watchdog since filing a complaint against Netflix in January 2019. \u201cOnly silence to report so far,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to Benaissa, part of the issue is a dearth of expertise \u2014 for which Wolfsen blames lawmakers. \u201cWhere there is criticism, we should criticise the national legislators about the lack of resources,\u201d he told POLITICO when asked about a lack of GDPR enforcement.\n\nBut according to former staffers, Wolfsen is partly to blame. They spoke of an environment where dissent wasn\u2019t tolerated and discussion was taboo. \u201cIt was a fear culture,\u201d said one, who asked not to be identified.\n\nAccording to an article in early 2019 by Dutch investigative journalism platform Investico, a total of 30 experienced employees left and about 115 newcomers arrived during 2017 and 2018. Many newcomers had little experience with privacy, according to former staffers quoted in the same article.\n\nAddressing the allegations, Wolfsen said that when he joined the authority he was tasked with making a lot of changes and restructuring the organization.\n\n\u201cThe Dutch authority was understaffed, changes were necessary and it\u2019s always the case that not everybody is always happy with the changes, but I\u2019m really very lucky with our staff members and the members of the board. People are positive about the way we are executing our duties,\u201d he said.\n\nWhat's next for the 60-year-old Dutchman? One possibility would be to take over as head of the European Data Protection Board.\n\n\"No I don\u2019t think so. It was not the dream of a young Wolfsen to become a deputy chair, and it\u2019s not the dream of an elder Wolfsen to become the chair.\"\n\nWant more analysis from POLITICO?

As many Silicon Valley companies have international headquarters in Dublin, the country's regulator has overarching powers to enforce the European Union's tough privacy standards.\n\nBut the agency's face-lift also contributed to confusion about its ability to enforce the law, according to more than two dozen current and former Irish data protection officials, other countries' European privacy regulators, tech company executives, data protection lawyers and privacy campaigners. Many spoke to POLITICO on the condition of anonymity due to their ongoing relationships with Ireland's Data Protection Commission (DPC).\n\n\"When you deal with them, you don't get the sense that they are there to vindicate data protection rights\" \u2014 Fred Logue, a privacy lawyer in Dublin\n\nThe internal changes were not well communicated outside the DPC, leaving some across the bloc in doubt over who was in charge of high-profile cases, according to officials at other EU agencies. People who had filed complaints with the regulator went months without a response, raising questions about how officials were enforcing the rules. Other European watchdogs began to voice concerns in public that the region's flagship privacy standards were not being enforced.\n\n\"Nothing has really changed,\" said Fred Logue, a privacy lawyer in Dublin who has filed multiple cases on behalf of clients with Ireland's privacy watchdog, adding that months would go by without hearing from officials. \"When you deal with them, you don't get the sense that they are there to vindicate data protection rights.\"\n\nThe agency's restructuring was the latest headache for the regulator two years after Europe's landmark privacy overhaul, known as the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, came into force in late May 2018.\n\nOver that time, Helen Dixon, the agency's head, and her staff of more than 140 regulators have yet to complete any of their investigations into Big Tech. Europe's new laws allow officials to impose fines of up to 4 percent of a company's global revenue, or potentially billions of euros, for failures to protect people's personal information. They've become the de facto global standard from Colombia to Japan, an achievement Brussels is eager to promote.\n\nYet discussions with both advocates and critics of Dublin's oversight reveal a picture of an agency struggling to come to terms with a powerful new regulatory weapon, with little experience or training about how to wield it. Last year, the agency received more than 7,000 data protection complaints, a record high. It's working through a backlog of cases as EU agencies are still trying to figure out how best to enforce the rules.\n\n\"We're dealing with a new framework,\" Dixon told POLITICO at the agency's Georgian townhouse headquarters in central Dublin, just a stone's throw from the country's parliament, in early March. She rejected claims her agency had been slow to act. \u201cWe are now on a pathway where we are going to resolve, one by one, as fast as we can with as many resources as we can, these very entrenched issues.\u201d\n\nPressure on Ireland\n\nWith the two-year anniversary of Europe's privacy standards coming next Monday, Dixon is under mounting pressure to show that her agency can act.\n\nSignificant fines and orders for change against both Facebook and Twitter are still expected by early summer, almost a year after the enforcement actions were originally expected.\n\nIt will be a make-or-break moment for the privacy regulator \u2014 and for Europe's boasts that it's the global trendsetter on privacy.\n\nFor the agency defenders, its slow pace in taking on cases, putting together bulletproof investigations and figuring out how to enforce Europe's new data protection laws is a sign that Dixon and her team are taking their beefed-up role seriously. The bloc's revamped privacy regime, advocates insist, does not give enough detail on how to implement the rules, particularly for policing multinational tech giants, It has been left mostly to the Irish to fill in the gaps.\n\n\"It's 10 times more complicated, and regulators aren't ten times as big,\" said Eduardo Ustaran, global co-head of the privacy and cybersecurity practice at Hogan Lovells, a law firm, in London. \"Nothing really could have prepared them for the size of GDPR.\"\n\n\"If a train never gets moving, less locomotives don't cause further delays\" \u2014 Max Schrems, an Austrian privacy campaigner\n\nOthers disagree. They point to multiple delays in even straightforward cases, including probes into publicly-disclosed misuse of social media data, as a sign that Dublin is not taking its role seriously.\n\nPrivacy advocates and some EU regulators grumble that despite Ireland's backlog of complaints, it is still dragging its feet on investigations that stretch back years, giving companies too much leeway in enforcing the rules and fostering a too close relationship with those it oversees.\n\n\"If a train never gets moving, less locomotives don't cause further delays,\" said Max Schrems, an Austrian privacy campaigner who has become the Irish regulator's quasi-b\u00eate noire after pushing them to take action, mostly against Facebook, since the early 2010s.\n\nStruggling to keep up\n\nIn discussions with Irish regulators, European counterparts and others involved in Europe's new privacy regime, POLITICO pieced together how Dublin struggled to cope with its expanded role.\n\nA major stumbling block has been creating watertight legal cases needed to levy hefty fines because, under the bloc's previous privacy regime that dated back to the mid-1990s, Dublin did not have the authority to issue financial penalties for wrongdoing. Under Irish law, it did gain lengthy litigation experience around privacy violations. But without a track record of financial enforcement, regulators have been racing to get up to speed just as pressure to act becomes ever more acute.\n\nThat left some within the agency anxious to avoid procedural mistakes \u2014 particularly when dealing with untested, new privacy standards \u2014 that could be unpicked in eventual appeals. Irish law provided little breathing space for such legal missteps, according to several local privacy experts.\n\nFor outsiders, the delays proved frustrating.\n\n\"You don't hear anything about cases transferred to Ireland,\" said Johannes Caspar, head of Hamburg's data protection regulator, whose agency is the first port of call for privacy complaints about almost all U.S. tech firms in Germany. \"What goes on, what type of information was exchanged, we don't get any of that. We're here just standing and waiting.\"\n\nGraham Doyle, a spokesman for the Irish authority, said other regulators could ask Dublin for updates on the ongoing cases during monthly meetings of EU privacy agencies.\n\nDifficulties began soon after Europe's new privacy rules began in May 2018.\n\nDays into the new regime, the regulator was flooded with requests, both from locals and people abroad who wanted to take advantage of the new privacy protections to land major complaints.\n\nSome, like those lodged by Schrems, garnered international attention and focused on Big Tech's data collection practices. Currently, Dublin has 23 open cases into the likes of Microsoft, Apple and Facebook, which is under investigation for everything from mundane data breaches to complex probes into how the company makes money from Europeans' personal information. The social networking giant declined to comment for this article.\n\nThe influx of work represented a challenge for a staff that had grown from just 29 when Dixon took over in 2014 (when the agency was mostly based over a small convenience store in a Portarlington, a small town in central Ireland) to a team of roughly 175 by the end of this year, spread over three different locations. Some complaints took months to garner responses, as different units divvied up tasks and regulators juggled to keep people in the loop on how investigations were proceeding, according to those involved in the some of ongoing cases.\n\nLast year, amid a record number of complaints, the agency said it had sent people's cases for enforcement, or closed others' complaints, in just over 80 percent of the 6,904 cases it had received last year, according the DPC's annual report. Roughly 4,500 were concluded without specific enforcement, while 1,100 are now waiting potential fines and other remedies.\n\n\"When the spotlight is on you, you have to be seen to act\" \u2014 Daragh O'Brien, Irish data protection consultant\n\nCurrently, the watchdog has just under 2,500 open complaints filed since Europe's new privacy rules came into effect in 2018. Dixon, the Irish regulator, said that many cases had been resolved before reaching the need for a formal investigation, and that her team was in regular contact with those who had submitted complaints.\n\nYet Daragh O'Brien, an Irish data protection consultant who filed multiple complaints on behalf of himself and mostly domestic clients, said that months would go by before receiving confirmation the agency had received his requests. Case workers would be replaced by someone new, often without explanation, and few, if any updates, would be sent out to those who had submitted cases. Schrems also said he had yet to receive an update from Dublin on his cases against WhatsApp and Instagram since he filed them almost two years ago. The regulator sent its initial findings to him in those cases earlier this week.\n\n\"When the spotlight is on you, you have to be seen to act,\" said O'Brien.\n\nIreland pushes back\n\nJust as Dublin was plowing through the increased regulatory work, European counterparts piled on the pressure.\n\nAt regular monthly gatherings of the region's privacy agencies, officials would ask for updates on the high-profile cases involving Facebook and other tech giants, and urged Dixon and her colleagues to move faster on enforcement, according to several officials involved in the meetings. Some, including French and German regulators, moved against these companies on their own, with Paris fining Google \u20ac50 million \u2014 a then-record penalty \u2014 in early 2019 for privacy violations. The search giant is appealing that decision.\n\nOfficials at several EU data protection authorities told POLITICO that cases they had sent to Ireland for investigation sat in an internal IT system for Europe's data protection agencies for months with few, if any, updates to the case work. Some, including Hamburg's Caspar, felt they had been left in the dark over how cases involving their citizens were unfolding, despite monthly calls between Ireland and French and German regulators. Ireland recently joined forces with Spain as part of its investigation into Verizon Media.\n\nThose inside the Irish watchdog pushed back against those claims. Officials said they would go months without receiving the necessary information from other EU agencies to push investigations forward despite other regulators chiding Dublin for not moving fast enough. At the regular meetings of the bloc's privacy authorities to update on its case load, the Irish would ask others to lend a hand \u2014 requests that often went unmet.\n\nIrish officials also questioned others' intentions in criticizing their work. They pointed out that few, if any, EU watchdogs had successfully brought enforcement actions against international companies, like banks and other global financial institutions, which fell under other countries' own jurisdictions.\n\nIreland's data protection watchdog \"will eventually come out with a few big decisions and everyone will calm down,\" said Johnny Ryan, chief privacy officer at Brave, a mobile browser, who filed a complaint against Google with the agency, but has yet to receive an update on his case. \"But they're taking more than enough time.\"\n\nInternal changes\n\nAmid this political wrangling, the restructuring of Ireland's privacy watchdog was well underway, with several senior managers leaving the organization late in 2019 just as Dublin was preparing its first blockbuster enforcement action against Facebook.\n\nOfficials like Donna Creaven, former head of supervision and engagement with multinational tech companies, took senior roles in other public sector bodies, according to data from LinkedIn. As part of a recruitment push, the agency said it would hire several senior lawyers and data protection experts for its ongoing investigations. But the benefits package \u2014 maximum salaries for positions posted earlier this year topped out at \u20ac83,740 \u2014 has put off possible candidates, according to four local privacy experts who had considered applying. In response, an Irish official told POLITICO they had been inundated with applications.\n\nJust as the watchdog's revamp was winding down in late 2019, Helen Dixon got some bad news.\n\nLast fall, she had asked the Irish government for an extra \u20ac5.9 million, or an almost 40 percent bump, to top up the regulator\u2019s annual budget. The request was both to hire investigators and create new internal structures to reduce the agency's reliance on the justice ministry for back-office functions like IT and human resources support. All EU privacy agencies have been pleading for more resources to handle the increased workload under the region's new rules.\n\nBut the answer was no.\n\nIn October, Irish lawmakers instead doled out an additional \u20ac1.6 million, an 11 percent annual rise, for the agency\u2019s war chest. It was enough to hire up to 40 more employees, but remained well below what many inside had hoped for.\n\n\u201cGovernments all signed up to this law,\u201d Dixon told POLITICO, adding that she was satisfied with the budget increase her agency was given. \u201cIf you want to meet those expectations, additional staff are going to be required.\u201d\n\nThe budget decision came at a delicate time.\n\nIreland's regulators had expected to announce their first major decision against Facebook by the end of 2019. It would be the culmination of years of work and a symbol that Dublin was able to fulfill its role as the West's first line of defense against data protection abuses.\n\nBut amid legal delays, the decision \u2014 linked to how Facebook failed to explain to users how their data would be shared between WhatsApp and the social network, the internet messenger's parent company \u2014 stalled. An announcement was postponed well into 2020.\n\nFor Dublin's supporters, the delay was unavoidable. Better to wait and build cases that would hold up in court, they insist. \"We want to create sustainable solutions to problems that have been around in data protection for a long time,\" Dixon said when asked about why no enforcement action against tech companies had yet to be published. She did not comment on any specific case.\n\nBut for those already losing patience with Ireland, the country's inability to bring Silicon Valley to heel almost two years after Europe's new privacy regime began had started to wear thin.\n\n\"I won't say they did a good job,\" said Caspar, the German regulator, in reference to the Irish privacy watchdog. \"To do a good job, they would need to issue draft (enforcement) decisions.\"\n\nVincent Manancourt contributed reporting from Brussels, Elisa Braun contributed reporting from Paris.\n\nWant more analysis from POLITICO?

However, those more traditional links have been neglected for years, and won't be quick to rebuild.\n\nThe transport report, in the works since last July, looked at whether the state could negotiate contracts to run trains to Cologne and on to Brussels, and said that it probably could.\n\nThe problem for Eneroth was that the report also said such trains wouldn\u2019t run until 2022 at the earliest, and a raft of hurdles remained ahead of the project including uncooperative German authorities and a lack of rail capacity.\n\n\u201cThe coming years will be a test for not only Sweden but the European Union\u201d \u2014 Tomas Eneroth, Swedish infrastructure minister\n\nIn an interview, Eneroth defended his country\u2019s record on rail, saying it remained \u201cvery ambitious,\u201d but acknowledged that more must be done across Europe to reach the goals on climate change set in Paris in 2015.\n\n\u201cThe coming years will be a test for not only Sweden but the European Union,\u201d he told POLITICO.\n\nTrains and planes\n\nFor Sweden\u2019s vocal \u201cflight-shamers,\u201d who inspired a global anti-flying movement, the report into sleeper trains was the latest sign that even this relatively climate crisis-aware country \u2014 the home of Greta Thunberg and one of Europe\u2019s most successful Green Parties \u2014 is moving too slowly to counter global warming, and it could be about to miss a post-coronavirus window of opportunity to pick up the pace of change.\n\nA proposed high-speed rail network linking Sweden\u2019s three main cities has regularly become mired in political and expert disagreement and ferry services across the North Sea to the U.K. haven\u2019t run since 2006.\n\n\u201cMore must be done,\u201d said Maja Ros\u00e9n, who heads a campaign against flying called We Stay on the Ground.\n\nThe coronavirus is adding to the pressure to rethink the country's dependence on flying.\n\n\u201cThe pandemic has shown us that it is possible to stay on the ground in a crisis and we need to avoid all the flights that we can in the future as well,\u201d Ros\u00e9n said.\n\nUntil the 1980s, travel to the Continent by train from Sweden was a popular option, even for business purposes, as trains were comfortable and flying was expensive, the Swedish transport administration\u2019s report notes. Travel by boat to the U.K. was also common, despite a crossing time of around 26 hours between Gothenburg and Newcastle.\n\nThe advent of budget airlines radically changed the picture as they drove down prices while opening up new routes. Ferry services across the North Sea were cut and Swedish investment in rail flatlined.\n\nThe first signs of a backlash against flying began around two years ago.\n\nIn a much-cited piece from January 2018, the writer Jens Liljestrand questioned the rationale behind flying to see exotic environments that the very act of flying was destroying.\n\n\u201cIt is a lifestyle beyond all idiocy,\u201d he wrote.\n\nIt's a sentiment that's increasingly widely shared, spurred by Thunberg, who traveled to the U.N. in New York by sailboat last year to avoid flying.\n\nHang your head and fly\n\nThe Swedish ideas of \u201cflight shaming,\u201d or flygskam, and \u201ctrain boasting,\u201d or t\u00e5gskryt, have spread far beyond Sweden\u2019s borders.\n\nThey've had an impact in Sweden, where flight passenger numbers fell 4 percent in 2019 while a private train company has begun running a sleeper service to Berlin.\n\nThe pandemic has turned that slight decline into a rout; Sweden had been especially hard hit, possibly because of its controversial policy of not locking down the country. SAS reported that its scheduled capacity for April was down 95 percent compared with the same month last year; only a limited number of flights to Sweden and Norway were still available. The airline, which has received a state guarantee for a \u20ac137 million credit line, expects normal conditions to resume only in 2022.\n\nEneroth said he is in discussions with the aviation industry about the use of less environmentally damaging fuels, among other things, and noted that the ultimate goal for the sector is electrification \u2014 something which is still a long way off.\n\nHe is also seeking to introduce a system that will allow Swedes to easily compare the environmental impact of different travel options when they buy tickets.\n\n\u201cIf we really want to come out of [the pandemic] stronger and future-oriented, we absolutely need to make the transformation toward a green society\u201d \u2014 Frans Timmermans, the EU's Green Deal chief\n\nHow the post-pandemic picture develops could serve as a litmus test for Europe\u2019s appetite to engage with the climate crisis and the sacrifices that countering it could involve.\n\nThe Swedish coalition government, which includes the Green Party, introduced a tax on flights that is now 62 krona (\u20ac6.33) per passenger for a flight to Germany, for example.\n\nIt has also pushed a plan for a new high-speed railway linking Stockholm, Gothenburg and Malm\u00f6, but has struggled for the broad parliamentary support needed for such an expensive and long-term project. In a report published in February, academics from the Royal Institute of Technology said Sweden should go ahead with the plan.\n\n\u201cIt is about sustainable mobility for people and goods in the future,\u201d the researchers said.\n\nHowever, others say the benefits of the rail expansion have been overdone and the economic and environmental costs of building the new network mean it should be shelved.\n\nFor Europe, the outcome of these types of domestic debates could decide whether the Continent turns the corner on carbon emissions or settles for \"business as usual.\"\n\nThe Commission\u2019s leader in this area, Green Deal chief Frans Timmermans, has encouraged the imposition of conditions on financial support to companies during the pandemic as a way to boost the transition to a low-carbon economy.\n\n\u201cIf we really want to come out of [the pandemic] stronger and future-oriented, we absolutely need to make the transformation toward a green society,\u201d he told a videoconference of the European Parliament\u2019s environment committee in late April.\n\n\u201cThings will not go back to how they were,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we must make sure that we give our society the impulse to reform in the direction that would create a sustainable society.\u201d\n\nWant more analysis from POLITICO?

It is well above some locked-down states like Finland at 54 but well below other countries with a much stricter regime, like the U.K. at 510. Experts say they will need more time to make a proper assessment of the effect of different lockdowns on public health.\n\nMeanwhile, when it comes to the economic effects of Sweden\u2019s more relaxed approach to tackling the pandemic, experts seem readier to make an early assessment: They don't think it will help much.\n\nRecent data showed the economic slowdown in Sweden in the first three months of 2020 was less extreme than elsewhere in Europe \u2014 a contraction of 0.3 percent versus 3.8 percent in the eurozone \u2014 but economists are bracing for a big hit.\n\n\u201cThe economic consequences of the pandemic will be considerable,\u201d Sweden\u2019s central bank said in a recent report as it forecast an economic contraction for Sweden of between 7 and 10 percentage points for this year and unemployment of between 9 and 10 percent. Last year the jobless figure was 6.8 percent. The European Commission's current forecast for the eurozone for 2020 is for an economic contraction of 7.75 percent.\n\nThe calamitous outlook for Sweden is a result of its reliance on exports, especially to the struggling eurozone and United Kingdom, officials say.\n\nExports keep around a million and a half of Sweden\u2019s population of 10 million in work, and the upside of keeping restaurants and hair salons open can\u2019t compensate for the huge downside of production stops at big manufacturers from S\u00f6dert\u00e4lje-based Scania trucks and Gothenburg-based Volvo cars.\n\n\u201cThe crisis has shown us once again how export-dependent we are,\u201d Gothenburg Mayor Axel Josefson told POLITICO. \u201cA recovery could take longer than people think.\u201d\n\nLessons from Sweden \u2014 both in terms of death rates and economic impact \u2014 look set to be of particular importance over the weeks ahead. As countries like France and Italy begin to relax their lockdowns, their approaches are beginning to look more like Sweden\u2019s, and data from the Nordic state could help officials in Paris and Rome better understand what the immediate future could look like.\n\nAt the end of April, World Health Organization spokesman Michael Ryan said Sweden's approach, for many countries, could represent \u201cthe new normal.\u201d\n\nThe country's light-touch rules were designed to let the illness spread slowly to allow health services to cope and immunity to build.\n\nLead epidemiologist Anders Tegnell said he felt little could be gained through some of the more draconian measures adopted elsewhere. He said keeping children at home was unlikely to slow the virus\u2019 spread and closing borders was largely futile.\n\n\u201cOne of the strong reasons why we are doing what we are doing in Sweden is that we feel this is very sustainable,\u201d Tegnell said in mid-April. \u201cWe believe we can keep doing this for months on end without any real harm to society.\u201d\n\nSo Swedes have been free to shop, eat at restaurants, go to the movies and get their hair cut by professionals. But the reality is, many have chosen not to. Swedes have a high level of trust in their authorities, surveys show, and many have heeded Tegnell\u2019s advice to restrict movement and stay apart.\n\nData from cellphone service providers shows people have stayed home to a much greater extent than normal, even during public holidays, and voluntarily abstained from nonessential activities \u2014 although mobility is higher than in other countries with strict lockdowns and walking journeys are now close to being back to where they were in January.\n\nSo despite the light-touch restrictions, Sweden's domestic economy has slowed, compounding the effect of collapsing exports.\n\n\u201cThere is much to suggest that the big fall will come in the second quarter\u201d \u2014 Magdalena Andersson, Sweden's finance minister\n\nAt a media briefing last Thursday, Finance Minister Magdalena Andersson gave an overview of the economic outlook. Her slides showed that sales in stores of the Sweden-based international clothing company H&M had fallen less in Sweden than elsewhere, but the difference between Sweden and locked-down Norway was limited. A snapshot of spending by debit card also suggested minimal differences between the two.\n\nSimilarly, a study by researchers at the University of Copenhagen suggested consumer spending in Denmark and Sweden had fallen by similar amounts, despite the very different approaches by the two countries to lockdown.\n\nAndersson concluded that overall, the worst isn't over yet. \u201cThere is much to suggest that the big fall will come in the second quarter,\u201d she said.\n\nIn V\u00e4llingby, the effect of the drop in consumer spending was on display, with a number of stores already shuttered and others offering heavy discounts.\n\nSingh, the stallholder, said his sales are down about 80 percent compared with the same month last year, and neighboring stalls were also suffering a profound slump. \u201cIt\u2019s a really tough time,\u201d he said.\n\nWant more analysis from POLITICO?

Even more challenging may be convincing anxious parents that now is the time to send their children back to school.\n\nAs Europe counts the cost of nearly four months of the coronavirus pandemic, governments are having to make the call.\n\nIt\u2019s \u201cone of the most difficult things\u201d for policymakers, said Russell Viner, president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health. \u201cIt\u2019s an impossible balancing task.\"\n\nWith no easy answers, Europe hasn\u2019t been able to settle on a consistent approach. Germany began reopening schools in April, with older students returning first. In England, it's the opposite, with primary schools poised to begin reopening in June.\n\n\u201cWe need to think about the risks of both opening schools and keeping them closed to children, parents, teachers and support staff\u201d \u2014 Martin McKee, professor at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine\n\nIn Belgium this week, those in the final years of primary and secondary school began to return to school. Italy and Spain, on the other hand, are treading much more cautiously and only reopening schools in September.\n\nTo complicate matters, parents aren\u2019t always on board with their government\u2019s plans. Over 500,000 Britons have signed a petition calling for the right to opt out of sending their children back to school. In Denmark, when schools began to reopen in April, some parents kept their children at home, saying they didn't want them to be \u201cguinea pigs,\u201d Reuters reported.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just the children who need to be considered.\n\n\u201cWe need to think about the risks of both opening schools and keeping them closed to children, parents, teachers and support staff,\u201d said Martin McKee, professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.\n\nThe kids are all right\n\nWhat all governments are scrutinizing is the science, which they hope will tell them whether it's safe to reopen schools.\n\nWhen the coronavirus first emerged, it quickly became clear that children were relatively unscathed.\n\n\u201cIn every major country, children have been very little affected by COVID-19 if you looked at the overall picture,\u201d said Viner, speaking at a press briefing on May 13. In China, the U.S., Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and the U.K, only around 1 to 2 percent of total coronavirus cases have been in those aged under 18, he noted.\n\nBut in late April, as many governments planned their school reopening schedules, there was a new twist: a rare inflammatory disease affecting some children.\n\nThe emergence of the syndrome, described as Kawasaki-like, prompted the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare an \u201curgent need\u201d for more data on the illness. The WHO also said it's \u201ctemporarily\u201d linking the syndrome to COVID-19, \u201cbased on initial laboratory testing showing positive serology in a majority of patients.\u201d\n\nBut to experts such as Viner and Liz Whittaker, clinical lecturer in pediatric infectious diseases and immunology at Imperial College London, the fact that the syndrome is so rare should mean that it shouldn't influence decisions to keep children at home.\n\n\u201cThe risk of getting severe COVID-19 in young children remains extremely low, despite this serious condition, which will affect very few,\u201d said Whittaker at the same May 13 briefing. \u201cIt shouldn't be a factor ... when decisions are made about when and how to reopen schools.\u201d\n\nThe risk of super-spreaders\n\nPolicymakers aren\u2019t just considering whether children get the virus, but how easily they may spread it \u2014 a reasonable fear given previous evidence of children being super-spreaders of illnesses such as influenza and measles.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s my biggest fear,\u201d Michael Hoelscher, head of infectious diseases and tropical medicine at Munich University Hospital, told the New York Times.\n\nBut the (limited) evidence doesn\u2019t support this.\n\nIreland\u2019s Health Information and Quality Authority has reviewed the data and found that from the small number of studies identified, \u201cchildren are not, to date, substantially contributing to the household transmission of SARS-CoV-2.\u201d\n\nThe one study that analyzed transmission in schools also showed very low spread, although the review admits that the \u201cevidence remains limited.\u201d\n\nThe WHO\u2019s chief scientist, Soumya Swaminathan, told the BBC's \"Andrew Marr Show\" on May 17 that it seemed that \u201cchildren are less capable of spreading it even if they get the infection.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s this lack of evidence that was cited by the British Medical Association, the U.K.\u2019s doctors' union, when it supported the country\u2019s National Education Union in its opposition to reopening schools before it deemed it safe to do so, reported the Guardian.\n\n\u201cLarge national decisions [are] not optimal in these situations given variance within a country\u201d \u2014 Devi Sridhar, chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh\n\nMcKee, at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, thinks it is \"premature\" to reopen schools in the U.K. as the country's testing system is \u201cproblematic\u201d and its contact-tracing system \u201cuntested.\u201d\n\nAnd some U.K. local authorities are ready to take matters into their own hands and refusing to reopen their schools, just as some mayors in France did earlier in May.\n\nDevi Sridhar, professor and chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh, believes that local-level data on levels of transmission and daily new cases is needed to inform these decisions.\n\n\u201cThis puts information directly into [the] hands of key members of the educational community,\u201d she wrote on Twitter. \u201cLarge national decisions [are] not optimal in these situations given variance within a country.\u201d\n\nWidening inequalities\n\nWhen to reopen the schools has been the \u201cmost delicate\u201d issue, said Marius Gilbert, head of the Spatial Epidemiology Laboratory at Universit\u00e9 Libre de Bruxelles and part of the group advising the Belgian government.\n\nIt\u2019s not just the risk of transmission increasing, Gilbert told L\u2019Echo. He warned of another danger \u2013 that of children being cut off from all social life and being deprived of the structure that school gives them.\n\nHarry Quilter-Pinner, senior research fellow at the Institute for Public Policy Research, agreed, calling this \u201cprobably one of the biggest disruptions we\u2019ve faced in the last 100 years in terms of education and schooling.\u201d\n\nFor Quilter-Pinner, the key concern is the widening of the attainment gap, which is the concept that children in deprived areas do worse than their wealthier counterparts.\n\nIndeed, data on England from the Institute for Fiscal Studies finds that during the outbreak, students from wealthier families have been spending more time on home learning and have better access to individualized resources such as private tutoring. Their parents also feel better able to support them.\n\nBut the problems don\u2019t stop when schools reopen.\n\n\u201cThe challenge of reintroduction is not just how do you get people back into classrooms,\u201d said Quilter-Pinner. \u201cIt\u2019s how do you build on what was normal to recover and get back to where we were before.\u201d\n\nReturning to school will require significant logistical challenges, with the need to maintain social distancing and have fewer children in a class, he noted.\n\nRisky business\n\n\u201cAs a society, we have choices to make,\u201d said Quilter-Pinner, such as addressing how big the risk of reopening schools is and whether we are willing to take that risk.\n\n\u201cIn any case, you will have to learn to live with the virus\u201d \u2014 Marius Gilbert of Universit\u00e9 Libre de Bruxelles\n\nAlastair Sutcliffe, professor of general pediatrics at University College London, said these decisions are based on considerations of \u201cvarious known risks.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne of the few positive things to come out of COVID is that it very rarely kills children, especially very young children, especially healthy young children,\u201d he said, adding that in reopening schools, we need to consider this very low risk versus other potential risks to children from not returning to school.\n\nWith no clear end to the pandemic in sight, schools will have to be reopened at some point, say experts like Gilbert at Universit\u00e9 Libre de Bruxelles: \u201cIn any case, you will have to learn to live with the virus.\u201d\n\nJames Randerson and Carmen Paun contributed reporting.\n\nThis article is part of POLITICO\u2019s premium policy service: Pro Health Care.

Failure to do so could result in fines of up to \u20ac1.25 million.\n\nThe law, which echoes similar rules already in place in Germany, piles more pressure on Silicon Valley firms to police millions of daily posts in Europe's two most populous countries.\n\nUnderscoring its importance to President Emmanuel Macron's La R\u00e9publique en Marche party, the bill was the first piece of legislation not linked to the coronavirus pandemic to come up for a vote since France imposed a lockdown in mid-March.\n\n\"During the lockdown, hate speech online has increased ... We can no longer rely on the platforms' goodwill. [The law] is the first brick of this new platform regulation paradigm,\" Junior Digital Affairs Minister C\u00e9dric O told the National Assembly ahead of the vote.\n\n\"This law is an attack on freedom of expression, and is also legally weak\" \u2014 Senator Bruno Retailleau of Les R\u00e9publicains\n\nHowever, its passing was somewhat overshadowed by claims against its rapporteur, MP Laetitia Avia. According to a report by investigative website Mediapart, published on the evening before the vote, five former assistants accused the lawmaker of harassment and of herself having made racist, homophobic and sexist comments. Avia has denied the allegations and said she would press charges for \"defamation.\"\n\nDuring the debate, the allegations were not mentioned, except by O who defended the lawmaker. \"To imply that she could be racist or homophobic makes absolutely no sense,\" he said.\n\nPushback and controversy\n\nFrance's decision to press ahead with the law days after a lockdown lifted showed that Paris has not lost its thirst for regulating the tech industry.\n\nWhile other flagship proposals such as the pension reform have been postponed indefinitely, Culture Minister Franck Riester said earlier this month that France would still transpose into national law by the end of the year an EU copyright reform that also targets Silicon Valley giants.\n\nThe hate speech legislation itself, which targets search engines as well as social media companies, has been the source of plenty of controversy. Online digital rights groups, tech companies, opposition parties have all criticized the initiative, and the Senate has led an effort to water it down by deleting the systematic deadline for removing content.\n\nOpponents argued in particular that the law would lead to lawful content being taken down and would hand too much power to the companies charged with making decisions on what content is considered \"obviously unlawful.\"\n\n\"This law is an attack on freedom of expression, and is also legally weak,\" Senator Bruno Retailleau, a member of the conservative Les R\u00e9publicains party, wrote in a tweet, adding that his party would refer the law to the Constitutional Council.\n\nThe European Commission has also voiced criticism, writing to the French government in November to ask for the legislation to be postponed. The EU executive argued that Paris should wait for its own planned rules on platforms, the Digital Services Act, to pass to set a common EU-wide standard on policing illegal content online. Brussels also said the French text might not comply with EU law.\n\nFrance brushed those concerns aside.\n\n\"Rest assured that we will make sure the Digital Services Act is ambitious enough,\" O told MPs Wednesday. \"To be able to lean on the experience of a national arsenal will be a precious asset to weigh in on the discussions,\" he added. He said the government would present implementation decrees in the coming weeks.\n\nIn the final vote, MPs also green-lit an amendment that forces platforms to take down flagged terrorist propaganda and child sexual abuse material within one hour, moving ahead before similar legislation at EU level is finalized.\n\n\"It's the police that gets to decide the criteria to censor a website\" \u2014 Digital rights NGO La Quadrature\n\nEU institutions are currently discussing a draft regulation with a one-hour removal timeline for terrorist content, but negotiations in Brussels are stuck.\n\nBefore the vote, digital rights NGO La Quadrature urged citizens to try to convince MPs to reject the text, arguing the hate speech law had now been transformed into an anti-terrorism arsenal that gives the police unchecked power.\n\n\"It's the police that gets to decide the criteria to censor a website,\" it said, adding that in French law, the notion of terrorism was broad enough to be used against demonstrators.\n\nElisa Braun contributed reporting.\n\nThis article is part of POLITICO\u2019s premium Tech policy coverage: Pro Technology.

It suggests that the government was, in fact, successful in isolating and preventing the spread of the strain of COVID-19 that circulated in China and Italy. The broader havoc in France \u2014 where some 25,000 people have died \u2014 it says, is caused by this mutation, which circulated mostly without causing obvious symptoms in Northern France in mid-to-late January.\n\nThe institute\u2019s findings suggest the government has been fighting an enemy that was within its borders much sooner than it thought, making the job of containing the spread that much harder. But the report has, characteristically, received little traction in a noisy media landscape more concerned with bashing the government\u2019s approach and airing grievances about its handling of the crisis.\n\nPublic support for President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s government has slipped since the start of the pandemic, with one recent poll finding that 62 percent of those questioned thought it incapable of bringing the virus under control.\n\nThe French are seldom satisfied with anything that their leaders do.\n\nThis lack of trust comes at a bad time for the government, as it embarks on the hazardous task of ending aspects of the lockdown starting on May 11.\n\nHow did we get here? In the United States and Britain, where government failures and miscommunication have been far more serious and more frequent, a large section of public opinion remains supportive and even enthusiastic.\n\nNot so in France. Partly, it\u2019s a question of national character and of a sense of French exceptionalism.\n\nThe French are seldom satisfied with anything that their leaders do. And given the volatility of the coronavirus crisis, there has been plenty to criticize.\n\nTo be sure, the French government is not undeserving of criticism. Macron was at least a week too slow in imposing a lockdown. France has also been lamentably sluggish in building up its testing capacities and responding to shortages of face masks and other personal protective equipment.\n\nBut Macron\u2019s government has, in fact, performed reasonably well in wrestling with an unprecedented, ill-understood and ever-changing foe.\n\nThe measures it has taken since the start of the crisis put France well ahead of some of its neighbors in mitigating the fallout. France was the first country to devise a generous economic support program for both businesses and individuals, for example. Some 11 million people are now receiving at least 80 percent of their normal wages from the state.\n\nFrance was ingenious in its use of re-equipped high-speed trains to move very sick patients to hospitals in relatively untouched areas. It has succeeded in broadly confining the virus to the north and east of the country; its hospital system has never been overwhelmed.\n\nApart from a couple of recent glitches, the government has communicated clearly and honestly \u2014 especially in comparison to the nationalistic bluster in the United Kingdom and the United States or the caginess about mortality figures in the Netherlands and elsewhere.\n\nAnd yet the overwhelming mood in France, not just on social media but in the mainstream media, is not just critical but viciously hostile. This is not just unjustified; it\u2019s dangerous.\n\nConspiracy theories are flourishing, and every small misstep or change of direction prompts accusations from opposition politicians that the government is \u201clying.\u201d\n\nMore than 30 legal complaints have been brought in France against the prime minister, health minister and other politicians for their alleged negligence in fighting the epidemic. Earlier this week, the Senate voted against a progressive loosening of the lockdown starting May 11. The vote was only symbolic, but it\u2019s nonetheless had a concrete effect: It has added to a growing lack of trust in the government.\n\nCompounding the problem for Macron is the fact that he doesn\u2019t have the kind of unquestioning tribal, partisan support that others, like Donald Trump or Boris Johnson enjoy: no one to say he is \u201cour man, right or wrong.\u201d\n\nHaving leaped to power from outside the dominant tribes of media or political power, he is nobody\u2019s \u201cman\u201d \u2014 and so for most of the country he is never right and always wrong.\n\nThen there is something deeper at play: France\u2019s love of abstraction and intellectual absolutism; its tendency to see everything as a matter of betrayal, conspiracy or national disgrace.\n\nAlmost every government has got things wrong in the present crisis, some more seriously than others.\n\nRight-wing commentators portray the shortage of hospital beds as symptomatic of a deep rot in the nation\u2019s will and psyche. Left-wing politicians insist that it is the consequence of the ultra-liberal destruction of the French state (which actually spends over 8 percent of its GDP on the public health system, more than most other EU countries).\n\nIn truth, the fall in the number of hospital beds in France is the result of policies pursued by both left and right-wing governments to conform with changes in modern medical practice over the past decades. It was indeed a close call but, with ingenuity and help from its neighbors, French intensive care capacity has taken all COVID-19\u2019s punches in the last six weeks.\n\nAlmost every government has got things wrong in the present crisis, some more seriously than others. But in no other country is there such a discrepancy between what the government actually got right and the cacophony of criticism hurled at it from the political classes or social and mainstream media.\n\nCommentators, on both the right and left, have compared France\u2019s response to COVID-19 to its \u201cstrange defeat\u201d by Germany in 1940 \u2014 a phrase invented by the French historian Marc Bloch, who argued that the lazy certainties and mutual hostility between the political right and left in the 1930s created an instinctive defeatism in France that made German victory possible.\n\nIt is absurd to compare the muddled but largely respectable French campaign against COVID-19 with the military calamity of 1940. But Bloch\u2019s warning about France\u2019s destructive penchant for over-analyzing itself in partisan, self-denigrating, absolutist slogans remains as valid as ever.", "link": "https://www.politico.eu/article/coronavirus-frances-strange-defeat/", "published": "2020-05-08T02:00:01+00:00", "author": ["John Lichfield", "Rym Momtaz", "Hans Von Der Burchard"]}, {"title": "Paris yet to provide details of cash pledge for coronavirus fight", "text": "Neither Emmanuel Macron's office nor the ministries involved have been able to tell POLITICO where the money is coming from, or how it'll be allocated | Fran\u00e7ois Mori/AFP via Getty Images Paris yet to provide details of cash pledge for coronavirus fight Days after high-profile conference, questions remain over where money will come from and where it will go.\n\nPARIS \u2014 France played a central role in the EU-led effort that raised \u20ac7.4 billion in pledges for the global fight against coronavirus \u2014 but it has yet to detail how it's sourcing or allocating its own contribution.\n\nAt the conference on Monday, President Emmanuel Macron announced France will commit \u20ac500 million to the Access to Covid-19 Tools Accelerator, an international collaboration intended to speed up the development and production of new vaccines, tests and treatments.\n\nBut four days later, neither Macron's office nor the ministries involved (including health and budget) have been able to tell POLITICO where the money is coming from, or how it'll be allocated.\n\nOn Friday, a French official familiar with the internal conversations among ministries told POLITICO that \"who pays is still under discussion\" but most of the funds would be new money.\n\nThe lack of clarity reflects the ambiguous nature of the totals announced at such headline-grabbing pledging conferences. It also gives fodder to critics who say the event's goals were rather nebulous, with significant differences between what various donors pledged and what constitutes new money.\n\nNorway's Prime Minister Erna Solberg, meanwhile, clearly earmarked the bulk of her country's pledge to vaccine development and distribution.\n\nThe EU, which hosted the event, pledged \u20ac1.4 billion, but officials acknowledged that this sum is entirely repurposed money from elsewhere in the bloc's budget, along with \u20ac400 million in loan guarantees.\n\nThe \u20ac7.4 billion total also includes money put toward the coronavirus response since January 30 \u2014 and the Commission wasn't eager to break down the total into new and old donations when asked by reporters this week.\n\nA Commission spokesperson said it didn\u2019t want to \u201cpunish\u201d countries for allocating money earlier than the pledging conference. \u201cWe\u2019re not asking the countries to explain what is new and what is not new,\u201d the spokesperson said Thursday.\n\nMost of the event's other donors were national governments, which have strict budget rules as well as tender requirements and other restrictions on how public funds are spent. When faced with the hasty organization of the conference, they were pushed to make symbolic \u201cpledges\u201d before all the legal and administrative details had been worked out.\n\nMacron has played a central role in championing a multilateral response \u2014 making a public show of support to the World Health Organization (WHO) when it has come under fire from Washington. He is also facing rising criticism at home for the domestic response to the pandemic, which has taken more than 25,000 lives.\n\nAs Macron explained it, France's contribution would be composed of four parts, the first being a \"substantial\" increase in funding to the WHO over the next two years, up from $76 million for 2018 and 2019. The problem: To date, no one within the French government has been able to provide the new number.\n\nThere are also few details on the other three pillars: accelerating the research and development of a coronavirus vaccine; ensuring equitable access to diagnostics and treatment; and supporting health care systems in vulnerable countries, namely in Africa.\n\nBy contrast, some other donors have gone farther to explain their pledges.\n\nFor example, the independent London-based charity Wellcome Trust announced that in addition to an early pledge of $100 million to vaccines alliance CEPI, it will give another $50 million to a Therapeutics Accelerator, plus $26 million to support essential research and capacity building in low- and middle-income countries.\n\nNorway's Prime Minister Erna Solberg, meanwhile, clearly earmarked the bulk of her country's pledge to vaccine development and distribution, as well as an additional small contribution to the WHO.\n\nWhen pressed about the lack of concrete details, French officials highlighted the fact that Monday's event brought about an unprecedented coordination and cooperation between the WHO, governments and NGOs in the global response to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nDavid M.

The desire to better understand how an animal virus managed to make its way into human lungs is also addressed in the resolution \u2014 an inquiry that would require cooperation from Beijing \u2014 and Trump\u2019s concerns about China\u2019s early transparency are widely shared by Western governments.\n\nBut here, too, the question concerns timing.\n\nChinese President Xi Jinping, addressing the WHA on Monday, said Beijing would back \u201cthe idea of a comprehensive review of the global response to COVID-19 after it is brought under control.\u201d\n\nA new internal report from a WHO oversight panel took that same view, warning that looking at the past too quickly could jeopardize the response in the present.\n\nIn interim recommendations drawn from a look at the WHO\u2019s response to COVID-19 between January and April, the Independent Oversight and Advisory Committee for the WHO Health Emergencies Program said a review of the WHO leadership\u2019s handling of the pandemic could be warranted.\n\nHowever, it added, \u201cconducting such a review during the heat of the response, even in a limited manner, could disrupt WHO\u2019s ability to respond effectively.\u201d\n\nThe report, published Monday according to Tedros, doesn't weigh in on how the WHO engaged with China. Instead, it notes that some countries didn't seem to take the WHO\u2019s warnings seriously enough.\n\nThat ties into Trump's accusation that Tedros slow-walked the declaration of a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) at China\u2019s behest. Yet the oversight committee said the varied responses by countries to that declaration, issued on January 30, \u201craises questions about whether Member States view a PHEIC declaration as a sufficiently clear trigger.\u201d\n\nThe report also urged enhanced \u201copenness and transparency\u201d related to the Emergency Committee that advises the WHO chief on declaring such emergencies.\n\nUnity on access\n\nOther points of contention traded over videoconference included political hot buttons such as Taiwan\u2019s status at the WHO (since it\u2019s not a U.N. member, it can\u2019t directly participate); Russia\u2019s takeover of Crimea; and U.S. sanctions against Iran and Cuba.\n\nBut there was unanimity on the concrete outcome of the WHA: the COVID-19 resolution, adopted without objections and co-sponsored by at least 144 of the WHO\u2019s 194 members.\n\nIn addition to calling for the review, the measure also lays out principles for equal access to coronavirus breakthroughs, calling immunization a \u201cglobal public good.\u201d\n\nTedros said in a speech that COVID-19 \u201cthreatens to tear at the fabric of international cooperation.\"\n\n\u201cA coronavirus vaccine should not be a luxury for a chosen few,\u201d von der Leyen said.\n\nFor its part, Washington didn't formally block the measure. But it did issue a written statement disassociating itself from several points, including language on abortion access.\n\nIt also rejected the suggestion of new patent pooling mechanisms in response to the pandemic \u2014 saying it would only back existing voluntary ways to share intellectual property. And it rejected paragraphs on equal access to medicines that the Trump administration views as undermining patent protections for pharma and removing a key incentive for innovation.\n\nAsked about Trump\u2019s latest threat to the WHO on Tuesday, Commission spokeswoman Virginie Battu-Henriksson sided with the health body, saying that now it was the time for solidarity and not \u201cfinger-pointing.\u201d\n\nIn the same spirit, Tedros said in his speech that COVID-19 \u201cthreatens to tear at the fabric of international cooperation,\" and vowed repeatedly that the WHO would continue its work: \u201cLet solidarity be the antidote to division.

Then-Labor Minister Ursula von der Leyen responded to a worsening of the crisis in 2011 by suggesting Germany demand gold reserves or stakes in industrial companies as collateral for any loans to fellow euro members.\n\nThough Merkel shot down von der Leyen\u2019s idea, the chancellor was hardly a pushover when it came to spending German treasure on eurozone weaklings.\n\nTimes have changed.\n\nConservative leaders say they have few qualms about accepting the common debt issuance as it doesn\u2019t entail the kind of large-scale mutualization they so feared during the Greek crisis.\n\nMerkel\u2019s conservatives have put their weight behind the Franco-German plan presented on Monday \u2014 which would move the EU one step closer to a bona fide fiscal union \u2014 with almost no questions asked.\n\n\u201cWe support Chancellor Merkel and President [Emmanuel] Macron\u2019s joint initiative as a major contribution to European solidarity in the corona crisis,\u201d the Christian Democratic Union\u2019s parliamentary group said in a statement, released during the Merkel-Macron press conference.\n\n\u201cThis is a process and it\u2019s important that Germany and France take a common position,\u201d Andreas Jung, deputy leader of the CDU parliamentary group, explained on German public television Tuesday.\n\nEven Friedrich Merz, a prominent fiscal conservative who is running for the leadership of the CDU, praised Merkel and Macron for \u201ca very good proposal.\u201d\n\nConservative leaders say they have few qualms about accepting the common debt issuance as it doesn\u2019t entail the kind of large-scale mutualization they so feared during the Greek crisis.\n\n\u201cThis proposal shows that European solidarity can work without mutualization of debt,\u201d Ralph Brinkhaus, the leader of the CDU parliamentary group, told Der Spiegel.\n\nAt least when it's old debt.\n\nCountries would not be allowed to use the money in the fund to repay existing obligations, which in Italy\u2019s case totals about \u20ac2.5 trillion. The bonds sold to seed the fund would be issued in the name of the EU. That means individual members would only be responsible for repaying their own share (to be determined by the European Commission) and not liable for others\u2019 portions.\n\nAt least in theory. It\u2019s hard to imagine that Germany (even if it\u2019s not legally bound) would allow the EU to default on the bonds if Italy or Spain couldn\u2019t pay what they owed. The fallout would be too damaging. Such concerns are just one reason German conservatives rejected similar plans in the past.\n\nSo why did Germany\u2019s conservative bloc go from being the scourge of southern Europe to its enthusiastic savior? In a word, business.\n\nUnlike the euro crisis, which triggered dramatic turbulence in financial markets but left German industry unscathed, the corona pandemic threatens Germany\u2019s own economic stability. The nations in the eye of the euro crisis storm, such as Portugal and Greece, were not key German trading partners. The countries in focus now \u2014 especially Italy \u2014 are a different story.\n\nItaly is Germany\u2019s fifth-largest trading partner with a total trade volume of more than \u20ac125 billion last year. Major German car companies and machinery makers rely heavily on suppliers in Italy\u2019s northern industrial corridor. Permanent damage to those supply chains could also do irreparable harm to German industry.\n\nThat\u2019s why German industry, traditionally close to the CDU, has been one of the loudest voices urging Berlin to push ahead with the recovery fund.\n\n\u201cThe EU\u2019s response should be unprecedented,\u201d said Dieter Kempf, president of the Federation of German Industries, the country\u2019s most powerful business lobby, in a joint statement with his counterparts from Italy and France last week. \u201cIn order to limit the damage to business and society from this crisis, we need a strong financial policy response with a strong show of solidarity for the hardest-hit countries.\u201d\n\nWhile Merkel appears to have secured the support of key conservatives, and the leaders of the Bavarian faction, her proposal has met with some resistance on the backbenches. Whether those voices, which are louder than they are influential, can mount a conservative uprising is doubtful, however.\n\nFor once, the rest of Europe needn't worry about Berlin's backing.\n\nThe German chancellor is riding high at the moment, with both her personal ratings and those of her party at their highest levels in years.\n\nThat\u2019s why the opposition is unlikely to have much luck in derailing the proposal either. The liberal Free Democrats are sticking to their longstanding position that debt mutualization is a no-go. But with the party polling at just 6 percent in opinion polls, its influence is limited.\n\nThe far-right Alternative for Germany might have had more luck mounting a counterattack if it weren\u2019t consumed by a civil war over some leaders' ties to neo-Nazi elements.\n\nFor once, the rest of Europe needn't worry about Berlin's backing.\n\nWant more analysis from POLITICO?

In response, operators are contemplating shutting down some renewable generation sources.\n\nThat's going to be an even more pressing problem over the upcoming bank holiday weekend that marks the start of the summer season, when electricity consumption tends to drop.\n\nIn order to prevent grid instability, Octopus Energy, which buys power generated from renewables on the wholesale market, made its customers an usual offer this Friday \u2014 the company will pay people to use power.\n\n\"We will pay over 100,000 of our customers with smart meters to run the dishwasher, use their oven or watch TV this weekend,\" Octopus CEO Greg Jackson told POLITICO. \"If they were to charge an electric car, for instance, they'd make 35 pence and be able to travel 50 miles, which is great because traveling the same distance in a petrol car you'd pay about \u00a36 to fuel up.\"\n\nThe grid-based problems being experienced by the U.K. are likely to become increasingly common as power generation becomes greener.\n\nJackson explained that the first-of-its-kind scheme was seeking to find alternative ways to balance a sensitive power grid while also rewarding customers equipped with smart meters, which allows them to control their energy use. About 4 million smart meters have been installed in the U.K. and the goal is to have 85 percent of power customers equipped with them by 2024.\n\n\"With the smart meter technology we're able to better manage power and empower customers to benefit from incentives available at specific hours, making the most of domestic household consumption at a moment when fewer factories and commercial surfaces are operating,\" he said.\n\nJackson argued that if wind and solar farms were shut off due to power oversupply, that could end up spooking investors and harm future investments in Britain's clean energy transition. \"If we start wasting electrons, that transition will become more complicated.\"\n\nJulian Leslie, head of networks for the U.K.'s National Grid electricity system operator, said that the drop in demand caused by the pandemic had raised concerns about the stability of the grid.\n\nWhile he said the electric power transmission network had \"mechanisms in place to avoid emergency restrictions or system disturbances,\" he added that customer-driven approaches like the one taken by Octopus could help soak up surplus power.\n\n\"As we roll out smart meters in the U.K., time of use tariffs that incentivize the use of low-carbon energy at off-peak hours could prove to be a useful tool if they're used at a wide, predictable scale,\" he said.\n\nDepending on the success of the scheme, similar initiatives could be feasible in other energy markets that use smart meters, which would lead to a more efficient use of renewable power.\n\nThe grid-based problems being experienced by the U.K. are likely to become increasingly common as power generation becomes greener.\n\nA study published by Imperial College London and electric utility Drax on Thursday showed that during the first three months of the year renewable energy sources provided more electricity than fossil fuels. Those findings line up with National Grid data \u2014 Leslie said there has been no coal-generated power since April 10, something that hasn't happened since the Industrial Revolution.\n\nLeslie said that solar and wind penetration had contributed to a \"mindset shift\" in Britain, where he said that after decades considering coal as a base load for power output, renewables were now being considered the base source to be \"topped up.\"\n\n\"There's no reason why we as a system operator need to buy coal, and it doesn't look like we'll need to until the winter, when demand will likely rise again,\" he said.\n\nThis article has been updated to clarify the reference to the National Grid electricity system operator.", "link": "https://www.politico.eu/article/in-covid-19-britain-it-pays-to-run-your-washing-machine-on-sunday-afternoon/", "published": "2020-05-22T15:02:09+00:00", "author": ["Aitor Hern\u00e1ndez-Morales", "Matei Rosca", "Kalina Oroschakoff"]}, {"title": "How coronavirus is changing access to abortion", "text": "As the coronavirus steamrolls the global order, reproductive health care practitioners and advocates are struggling to maintain access to contraception and abortions.\n\nLockdowns and disrupted supply chains have prompted a flurry of action in the sector as governments, practitioners and advocates react to a crisis that has highlighted the often tenuous access to sexual health care products and services.\n\nA recent joint report based on two separate surveys carried out by the European Parliamentary Forum for Sexual & Reproductive Rights (EPF) and the International Planned Parenthood Federation European Network (IPPF EN) warns that the pandemic \"is endangering the sexual and reproductive health and safety of women and girls and vulnerable people across Europe.\"\n\nSince the outbreak, 94 percent of IPPF EN members responding to the survey \"reported a decrease in the number and frequency of services and outreach activities,\" according to the report.\n\nIt also takes to task governments, such as those in Poland and Romania, that have used the outbreak \"to undermine women\u2019s health and safety just when this most needs to be protected.\"\n\nThe supply side\n\nThe EPF and IPPF EN are among the many groups calling on governments to recognize sexual and reproductive health care services as \"essential, life-saving and often time-sensitive services.\"\n\nAdvocates and practitioners stress the time-sensitive nature of abortion, whereby barriers can increase health risks either by necessitating surgical procedures or barring access altogether.\n\nOne key factor is that supply chain delays have affected operations, according to Chris Purdy, CEO of DKT International, a nonprofit that operates in 60 countries outside Europe and distributes contraception and abortion services and technology.\n\n\u201cPretty much every single link of the supply chain is being affected by the strain connected to coronavirus,\" he said.\n\nDelays can start with manufacturers, who depend on raw material suppliers, as they experience \u201cslow-downs, shutdowns [and] closures of their factories\u201d due to the virus, he said. These suppliers would ordinarily be the providers of everything from active pharmaceutical ingredients to packaging, he added.\n\nThese delays continue as export opportunities shrink; quarantines of products on arrival lengthen; and internal supply chains are disrupted.\n\nUNFPA Supplies reported at the end of March that European \"suppliers are manufacturing at full capacity at this time, although they expect increased prices and challenges sourcing packaging and APIs [active pharmaceutical ingredients] if the crisis persists.\"\n\nThat report, which is the most recent accounting, also includes a projection for coming months.\n\n\"Mindful of anticipated challenges, suppliers are seeking 'free carrier' contract arrangements under which UNFPA would arrange transportation for deliveries in the third and fourth quarters of 2020,\" the report said.\n\nWhile supply issues in Europe don't look too dire for now, \u201cthere will be a greater demand for women who are interested in limiting, or controlling or terminating their pregnancies, because usually that's what happens at times of uncertainty,\u201d Purdy noted.\n\n\n\nVirtual solutions\n\nIn a climate in which people are confined to their homes and apprehensive about visiting medical staff, difficulties in maintaining access to reproductive health care services and products extend beyond supply chains.\n\n\u201cYou're trying to move toward tele-health visits and really encouraging self-care as much as possible where that is feasible,\u201d said Daniel Grossman, an ob-gyn and professor at the University of California San Francisco.\n\n\"Contraception is one area ... where it would be safe and effective to make these methods available without a prescription,\" he said. \"This crisis is a good argument for expanding that kind of access, at least during the pandemic.\"\n\n\u201cThe anti-abortion movement, at least in the U.S., is really trying to capitalize on the pandemic to essentially make abortion illegal in several states\u201d \u2014 Daniel Grossman, professor at the University of California San Francisco\n\nIn March, France implemented temporary measures allowing women to use expired scripts to renew their oral contraceptive prescriptions. In neighboring Belgium, the government pushed ahead with existing plans to make the morning-after pill free, as well as other forms of contraception for those aged 18 to 25.\n\nThat measure \"will be key to continue ensuring access to contraception given the social and economic impact the crisis will have on women,\" the EPF and IPPF EN report said.\n\n\n\nBut the group also noted that its members in Albania, Austria, Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Denmark, Germany, Ireland, North Macedonia, Portugal and Spain \"have reported that they have been forced to scale back contraceptive care.\"\n\nReduced attendance at medical clinics \"due to fear of contracting COVID-19\" and hindered access to long-acting reversible contraception, such as contraceptive injections, implants or intrauterine devices, are among the barriers to reproductive health imposed by the pandemic, the report noted.\n\nManaging access to abortions\n\nTele-health is also a huge topic in the abortion sector.\n\nOn March 30, the British government introduced temporary measures that allow women to take abortion pills for early medical termination at home, provided that they follow a tele-health or physical consultation with a registered medical practitioner.\n\n\n\nPrior to that decision, the U.K. allowed medical abortions \u2014 which involve the administration of the drugs mifepristone and misoprostol, or surgical abortions \u2014 generally only up to 24 weeks of pregnancy.\n\nIreland has implemented similar provisions, allowing remote consultations in most cases for women seeking early medical abortions, while France has extended access to home medical abortions for women up to nine weeks pregnant, up from seven weeks as previously allowed.\n\nBy contrast, in the Netherlands, the Court of the Hague rejected an application to allow access to medical abortions without visiting an abortion clinic.\n\nMeanwhile, Germany, which requires mandatory counseling before abortions, has allowed this preliminary step to take place over the phone or by video, following pressure from abortion rights groups.\n\nBut Christiane von Rauch, a member of Doctors for Choice Germany, said this measure still leaves some access problems unaddressed, including shortages of personal protective gear in surgeries and clinics.\n\n\"Lack of PPE is a major issue cited by almost all respondents,\" agreed the EPF and IPPF EN report.\n\nIn the long run\n\nThe immediate challenge aside, the lasting impact of COVID-19 on global access to abortions could be mixed, experts say.\n\n\u201cThe anti-abortion movement, at least in the U.S., is really trying to capitalize on the pandemic to essentially make abortion illegal in several states,\u201d Grossman said, referring to moves by Texas and some other Republican-governed states to issue bans on abortions during the outbreak on grounds they're nonessential medical procedures.\n\n\"They've used the restrictions on what kind of businesses can continue to operate to say that abortion services are not essential health care and services need to stop,\" he added.\n\nIn Europe, advocates continue to call on governments to improve access, raising particular concern around countries such as Poland, where restrictive abortion laws have been compounded by border closures \u2014 a major hurdle given that Polish women used to go to Slovakia or Germany for the procedure.\n\nNow, women are not just cut off from travel; they also can\u2019t count on Polish facilities, as they lack both doctors and necessary equipment.\n\nAnother country noted in the report is Romania, where the EPF and IPPF EN noted that \"the decision to suspend non-emergency procedures is in practice hindering women\u2019s reproductive freedom.\"\n\nIn response to criticism, Romanian Health Minister Nelu T\u0103taru has said he takes women\u2019s rights issues seriously and that each case has to be analyzed by the doctor, according to local media.\n\nOn the other side, the introduction of emergency measures means there's also a potential \"switch\" moment for reproductive health care in Western European countries such as the U.K., Purdy says.\n\n\"It's hard to roll that back once that door is open,\" he said. \"And if they allow it there, then you can imagine it might start to happen in other places.\"\n\n\"The advent of medical abortion [and] abortion pills is changing how women look at their options in a major way,\" he added. \"Keeping women fully informed of how those pills can be used is going to change a lot in the abortion space.\"\n\nCarmen Paun and Zosia Wanat contributed reporting.", "link": "https://www.politico.eu/article/how-coronavirus-is-changing-access-to-reproductive-health/", "published": "2020-05-08T13:22:40+00:00", "author": ["Miriam Webber", "Meg Bernhard", "Jillian Deutsch"]}, {"title": "EU regulators give airlines flexibility on social distancing", "text": "Travelers wearing face masks walk through the check-in area of Schipol airport in Amsterdam on May 11, 2020 | Evert Elzinha/ANP/AFP via Getty Images EU regulators give airlines flexibility on social distancing New guidelines balance health with economic and logistical concerns.\n\nThe EU\u2019s top regulators have emphasized the importance of social distancing at the airport and on planes \u2014 but left it up to operators to decide whether that\u2019s feasible.\n\nAs countries across the bloc look to open up travel again, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) issued final joint safety guidelines late Wednesday designed to minimize the risk of spreading the coronavirus while flying.\n\nThe advice is likely to result in a huge variation in travel experience because of the flexibility it gives the industry to balance health with economic and logistical concerns.\n\nIn planes, for example, the guidelines state that \u201caeroplane operators should ensure, to the extent possible, physical distancing among passengers\u201d but only \u201cwhere allowed by the passenger load, cabin configuration and mass and balance requirements.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis may be achieved by leaving at least one seat empty between passengers, increasing the distance between the seats or leaving every other row empty,\u201d it suggests.\n\nThe tourism sector and airlines in general, hard hit by the pandemic, are keen to salvage what they can of their busiest time of year between June and September.\n\nAirlines such as Ryanair have been vocal with concerns that flying will not remain economically viable (without price hikes or government subsidies) if planes are forced to fly with middle seats empty.\n\nThe tourism sector and airlines in general, hard hit by the pandemic, are keen to salvage what they can of their busiest time of year between June and September. They argue limiting a plane to be two-thirds full will make it even harder for air travel to return.\n\nOther airlines such as Lufthansa and TAP Air Portugal have instituted empty-row policies as a temporary measure while flights remain largely unfilled.\n\n\u201cThe guidance is clear that while airlines should seek to maintain physical distancing where practicable, flexibility on seating arrangements is permitted,\u201d said global airline lobby IATA in reaction to the guidelines.\n\nAn earlier version of the guidelines obtained by POLITICO did not mention leaving every other seat nor entire rows empty.\n\nThe final version also backs wearing masks while flying, allowing only passengers into terminals and not permitting people to line up in cabins to use the toilet.\n\nOverall, the guidelines recommend that \u201caeroplane operators, airport operators and service providers should ensure that physical distancing of 1.5 metres is maintained wherever this is operationally feasible.\u201d\n\nBut they discourage temperature checks at airports \u2014 which were backed by airlines \u2014 as being a \u201chigh-cost, low-efficiency measure\u201d that would do little to identify cases.\n\nWhile screening at airports has been widely adopted, some countries, including the U.K., have resisted implementing airport controls \u2014 with British Deputy Chief Medical Officer Professor Jonathan Van-Tam stating the incubation period of the virus means checks would be ineffective in preventing spread.\n\nWhen it comes to the use of masks, airlines have emphasized their mandatory use as an effective measure in the absence of social distancing.\n\nBut the EU regulators say they are only a \u201ccomplementary measure and not as a replacement for established preventive measures, such as physical distancing, respiratory etiquette, meticulous hand hygiene and avoiding touching the face, nose, eyes and mouth.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe look forward to working with EASA and the ECDC to incorporate the relevant improvements\" \u2014 Lobby group A4E\n\nThey also warn about the potential \u201cfalse sense of security that can be given by wearing a face mask.\u201d\n\nAirports welcomed the guidelines.

The investigation followed similar reports about Amazon\u2019s Alexa and Google\u2019s home assistant, as both companies also employed human reviewers to listen to recordings in order to improve the artificial intelligence technology's efficiency.\n\nSince then, Apple said it moved to an opt-in system that requires users to proactively agree to have their recordings reviewed. Asked about the current program, a spokesperson for the company redirected POLITICO to blog posts from August and October which explain the changes made by the iPhone maker after the reports. \"By default, we will no longer retain audio recordings of Siri interactions. We will continue to use computer-generated transcripts to help Siri improve,\" Apple said.\n\nAmazon said it would allow users to opt out from the human reviews and Google paused the reviews, which haven't resumed since.\n\nLast summer, both regulators said they had \u201cquestions\u201d for Apple and Amazon, but decided not to initiate probes.\n\nBut despite the three companies publicly acknowledging that users might not have been fully aware of the listening programs at the time, no investigation was opened by the privacy regulators in charge of the companies.\n\nLe Bonniec chose May 20 to send his letter because the date is days ahead of the European flagship privacy reform\u2019s second anniversary, he told POLITICO. The former Apple contractor hopes his public letter will pressure regulators to act and says he\u2019s ready to testify in future probes. He reached out to all European data protection authorities, to the European Data Protection Board, the European Data Protection Supervisor and privacy regulators in Liechtenstein, Norway, Switzerland and Iceland.\n\nTwo years in, privacy regulators have yet to impose meaningful fines under the General Data Protection Regulation, raising questions about the ability \u2014 and, sometimes, the willingness \u2014 of data protection authorities to enforce the legislation.\n\n\u201c[The timing of the letter] is a reminder that we have legislation at EU level that is supposed to be good for something. Up until now, we\u2019re under the impression that there was no repercussion after the Apple, Google revelations.

Some corrections were applied to voice assistants, but not consistently within the industry,\u201d a spokesperson for the regulator said.\n\n\u201cMoreover, the underlying questions if and under what circumstances user data may legitimately be used to improve products (which is a key element to a wide range of AI systems, voice-based and beyond) are far from solved,\u201d the spokesperson added.\n\nIndeed, both Apple and Amazon still have reviewing programs in place. A spokesperson for Amazon said: \u201cWe annotate a fraction of 1 percent of interactions to improve the Alexa experience for customers. For example, this information helps us train our speech recognition and natural language understanding systems, so Alexa can better understand your requests, and ensure the service works well for everyone.\"\n\nThe spokesperson declined to comment on how many users had opted out.\n\nApple resumed its own Siri program in October with changes: Recordings are no longer stored by default, unless users agree to do it, and only Apple employees, instead of contractors, have access to the samples. The company declined to disclose how many users had opted in.\n\nAccording to Le Bonniec, regulators should \"verify\" that Apple indeed stopped processing samples without the users' knowledge.

In France, Chinese diplomats have ridiculed the ability of liberal democracies to respond to the emergency.\n\nBeijing\u2019s attempt to pressure the European External Action Service to water down a report that clearly lists Chinese influence activities was one of the latest \u2014 but certainly not the last \u2014 in a series of attacks on the EU.\n\nEurope is, in some ways, an unlikely target. Unlike the United States, leaders there did not blame Beijing for its handling of the health emergency at the start of the crisis. Europeans also consistently tiptoe around the most contentious problems in order to keep collaboration on climate change and multilateralism alive, but also to avoid fatal disruptions in the economic relationship.\n\nAnd yet, instead of making strategic use of Europe\u2019s cooperative stance, Beijing\u2019s aggressive, ham-fisted and sometimes outright inept campaign to stamp out any hint of criticism has irritated policymakers from Paris to The Hague, Brussels and Berlin.\n\nSo, why is Beijing doing this? While it\u2019s difficult to untangle the specific reasoning behind China\u2019s decision-making, there are at least three possibilities.\n\nPanic\n\nThe first is that Beijing is operating with a sense of panic. The Communist Party leadership has faced severe criticism over its handling of the pandemic, and it is increasingly nervous about domestic repercussions and the potential economic impact, which is likely to be significant.\n\nIn this sequence of events, the crisis has exposed massive challenges China had swept under the rug of economic growth for decades: authoritarian overreach, economic inequality, local debt, and deficiencies in the social and health care system, to name just a few.\n\nAs Chinese dissident author Ma Jian argued in February, President Xi Jinping is following the party\u2019s tradition of burying the truth to solidify its leadership. But as the virus spread around the world, burying the truth in nationalist domestic propaganda became more difficult. To remain in control and demonstrate the supremacy of its system, Beijing took its domestic tactics global \u2014 because making others look bad makes China\u2019s leaders look better at home.\n\nAnger\n\nThe second possibility is that the Chinese leadership is angry \u2014 especially about the way the United States is trying to blame Beijing for the virus, as Washington papers over its own incapacity to prepare for the pandemic and handle its fallout.\n\nEven before the pandemic, the battle between the U.S. and China had already moved far beyond the initial trade war into the territory of systemic confrontation. The Chinese leadership, worried that Washington is seeking to exploit a moment of weakness, may have decided to proactively lash out against the U.S. and its allies alike.\n\nEurope, in this scenario, is to a degree collateral damage in the bigger struggle between these two global powers \u2014 a struggle in which Europe will not be neutral, as Beijing sees it, but will necessarily take Washington\u2019s side.\n\nCalculation\n\nThe final option is that Beijing is simply taking a calculated risk. China\u2019s shift into offense, the thinking here goes, comes at a time of European weakness. As such, it is a strategic and deliberate move to bully Europe into compliance at a time when there is little unity and a lot of nervousness among EU countries.\n\nThis could explain Beijing\u2019s initial attempts to score points with countries most affected by the virus \u2014 such as Italy \u2014 by sending face masks and other medical gear, in an effort to demonstrate the benefits of friendly relations with China.\n\nThis strategy rests on the assumption that times have changed, and that Europe needs China more than China needs Europe \u2014 especially when it comes to its economic recovery post-crisis. The fact that Europe\u2019s top diplomatic personnel allowed a recent op-ed by EU ambassadors celebrating the anniversary of EU-China diplomatic relations to be censored before it was published in the China Daily demonstrates that this assumption is not fully unwarranted.\n\nThe toughening of Europe\u2019s stance toward China over the last two years, which saw the EU label it a \u201csystemic rival,\u201d was not in Beijing\u2019s interest. Now, the Chinese leadership may see a chance for course correction. If Europe gives in, it can continue to do business as usual.\n\nAll of the above\n\nThe most likely explanation is that all these dynamics \u2014 an eye toward the domestic audience, a limited degree of panic, a dose of anger and the desire to make the most of a strategic opportunity \u2014 are informing Beijing\u2019s current approach.\n\nWhat is unclear, however, is whether this is a temporary offensive that will ebb as the pandemic fades, or is part of the \u201cnew normal\u201d awaiting Europe in the future.\n\nIn the short term, those in Europe who had been sounding the alarm bell about China before the crisis have been handed more leverage to pursue a confrontational agenda, while supporters of deeper engagement may find it harder to make their case. Already, the calls for reducing the bloc\u2019s dependency on China and diversifying its economy are growing louder.\n\nUltimately, economic relations between China and Europe are still strong. It will take more than just a few diplomatic missteps to completely derail them. But if the past few weeks are a sign of a permanent shift toward a strategy of intimidation, views in Europe may well harden against China even more broadly. In the end, Beijing may find it has made a huge strategic mistake: Losing Europe to win the battle of narratives would be a big price to pay.", "link": "https://www.politico.eu/article/coronavirus-china-behavior-in-europe/", "published": "2020-05-07T11:15:13+00:00", "author": ["Janka Oertel", "Jacopo Barigazzi", "Jakob Hanke Vela", "Laurens Cerulus", "David M.

There will doubtless be plenty of occasions when people raise their hand to ask to go to the toilet and then feel the eyes of fellow passengers upon them and instead buy some scratch cards and a bottle of Paco Rabanne. Whether cabin crew will hand out individual sheets of toilet paper wasn't made clear in the video, nor was it stated if passengers in first class seats will get extra paper or if sweary Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary will introduce a charge to use the lavatory. It wouldn't be a surprise if he did as back in 2009, he floated a \"pay a pound to spend a penny\" plan that was only scuppered by technical issues.\n\nThere are already major changes afoot for those who prefer to stay on land. Authorities in the Belgian region of Bredene have announced the closure of the country's only nudist beach for the whole summer (which in reality is about three days of actual sun). The space will instead be used to allow extra social distancing for the sworn enemy of the nude sunbather, the clothed sunbather.\n\nOf course, if your idea of a good time is to wander around a beach on the North Sea coast then social distancing is likely every bit as normal as people pointing, laughing and then running away.\n\nCAPTION COMPETITION\n\n\"The new series of Baywatch looks rubbish.\"\n\nCan you do better?

The EU\u2019s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, is planning to travel to Sudan on Friday.\n\nEU honchos are becoming familiar faces in Addis Ababa. Council President Charles Michel visited earlier this month during the annual AU leaders\u2019 summit, and von der Leyen herself made a highly symbolic trip back in December within days of starting her mandate to declare the start of the EU\u2019s southward pivot.\n\nWith the EU both feeling betrayed by Britain and the U.S. and menaced by Russia and China, von der Leyen\u2019s \u201cgeopolitical Commission\u201d looks to its giant next-door neighbor for new friends, new economic opportunities and better ways to contain security threats \u2014 especially from uncontrolled migration.\n\nInterest in Africa is not entirely new. The shift began under von der Leyen\u2019s predecessor, Jean-Claude Juncker, who called for a \u201cnew alliance\u201d to create 10 million jobs in Africa over five years in his 2018 State of the Union speech.\n\nWith the EU\u2019s treasured multilateral order under increasing threat, however, as well as a pressing need for allies to address new policy challenges like fighting climate change, the EU\u2019s intensified focus on Africa represents a significant turnabout.\n\nBack in September 2016, when EU leaders met in Bratislava to agree on a vision for the bloc\u2019s future in the aftermath of the traumatic Brexit referendum result, Africa didn\u2019t even warrant a mention in the final declaration.\n\nThe omission triggered a fierce reaction from then-Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi who, concerned about a surge of migrant arrivals on Italy\u2019s shores, shunned a joint press conference with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and then-French President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande.\n\nNow, faced with a U.S. retreat from multilateralism under President Donald Trump and both China and Russia making firm grabs for global influence, nearly all EU countries \u2014 including the Central and Eastern states and the Baltics \u2014 seem to be on board.\n\n\u201cBratislava was before Trump\u2019s election, which I think is one of the most vital elements here,\u201d said Chloe Teevan, a policy officer focusing on EU-Africa relations at the European Centre for Development Policy Management. \u201cMultilateralism is under attack, and our traditional ally in supporting the multilateral order is no longer really an ally on that. We need new allies.\u201d\n\nThe pivotal year\n\nIn December, EU foreign ministers declared 2020 the pivotal year for their relationship with Africa. Thursday\u2019s unprecedented meeting of EU and AU top brass is intended to maintain the momentum created by both Michel and von der Leyen\u2019s visits.\n\nNext on the agenda is the Commission\u2019s formal strategic vision for the relationship with the continent, due to be released in mid-March. A meeting with leaders from the Sahel region has been attached to the regular EU leaders\u2019 summit in Brussels later that month, to be followed by a joint meeting between AU and EU ministers in Rwanda in May. The diplomatic caravans culminate with the sixth EU-AU summit in Brussels this fall.\n\nSome diplomats and officials say that the new impetus comes mainly from Paris and Berlin, with help from von der Leyen, a former German defense minister and close ally of Merkel. The Eastern and Baltic countries, usually more concerned about threats posed by Russia, are going along with it \u2014 albeit under some pressure.\n\n\u201cThey agree just because Germany is pushing for it,\u201d said one senior EU diplomat, \u201cotherwise, their interest would remain very low. They added that alongside geopolitical considerations, economic interests were a key factor.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a competition, also internally, between the French and the Germans to enter a market as countries like Nigeria are becoming increasingly interesting,\u201d said the diplomat, highlighting German car manufacturer BMW\u2019s industrial plan in South Africa.\n\nEU diplomats fear that Russia and China, with the support of many African countries, will gain a greater say over internet norms and rules.\n\nBrussels hopes to capitalize on the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), a regional trade agreement that came into effect in May 2019. Although still in the early stages of implementation, it is a potential game-changer for business with Africa \u2014 which has a consumer market of 1.2 billion people and a combined GDP of more than \u20ac2 trillion.\n\nThe EU\u2019s assertiveness, however, could also face resistance from African countries increasingly wanting to be considered as self-reliant.\n\nAlthough EU officials have stressed a desire to move past the legacy of colonialism, Europeans often still speak in ways that Africans view as both paternalistic and unjustified, given Africa\u2019s population is roughly triple that of the EU. The AU also has more than twice as many countries; the Congo alone is 75 times bigger than Belgium, its former colonizer.\n\n\u201cThe principle of finding African solutions for African problems must be our over-riding theme in addressing all the conflicts on our continent,\u201d South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said in his inaugural speech as the 2020 chairman of the African Union earlier this month.\n\nA senior East African diplomat said Europe was a \u201ckey partner\u201d for security. \u201cThey are also helping a lot when it comes to financing the AU,\u201d they said, \u201cbut it\u2019s not like Africa will instantly drop everything for Europe\u2019s benefit. They need to come up with substantial programs that actually benefit Africa.\u201d\n\nItaly and Spain want Brussels to work with African countries on more agreements allowing the return of people whose asylum claims are rejected.\n\nSensitivities notwithstanding, the EU has its eye on the rising global influence of Moscow and Beijing. Diplomats point to a recent vote on the issue of cybercrime at the United Nations General Assembly, where many African states sided with Russia and China.\n\nThe EU and its allies \u2014 including the U.S. this time \u2014 pushed for the adoption of the Budapest Convention, which is the only legally binding international treaty that lays out common standards on cybercrime investigations. On the other side were Russia and China, which refused to join, calling instead for a new global cybercrime treaty at the U.N.\n\nEU diplomats fear that Russia and China, with the support of many African countries, will gain a greater say over internet norms and rules. On this and other issues, the 54 African countries that are members of the United Nations form a big bloc should they act together.\n\nOther factors at play are Russia\u2019s increasingly aggressive efforts to build military and security ties to African countries like the Central African Republic, and more recently in Libya.\n\nMigration control\n\nAlso key to the EU\u2019s motivations are migration and security. Italy and Spain in particular \u2014 as the main arrival points for irregular migrants \u2014 want Brussels to work with African countries on more agreements allowing the return of people whose asylum claims are rejected.\n\nFrance also has a major longstanding military presence in the Sahel, the West African region including Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger. Paris has deployed almost 5,000 soldiers to counter Islamist militias in the region.\n\nAccording to two senior diplomats, the \u20ac10.5 billion the Commission proposed to allocate to an off-budget \u201cpeace facility\u201d is mainly designed to send EU battlegroups to Sahel to help French troops stabilize the region. In Mali and Burkina Faso in particular, anti-French feeling is growing, making it harder for the force there to be effective. One EU official referred to \u201cthe risk of an EU Afghanistan\u201d \u2014 a military involvement that can drag for many years with little or no solution in sight.\n\nThe potential for trade and the security threat have been evident for years; why all the attention from the EU now?\n\nA senior European diplomat from a non-EU country said von der Leyen had few options where to direct her geopolitical aspirations. \u201cI think in some ways the European Commission, when it looked at the world, had nowhere else to go. I don\u2019t think von der Leyen, when she looked at the U.S., Russia, China or Latin America, will have been very tempted. Africa is basically all Europe has left as a partner.\u201d\n\nSome diplomats say that the continent might have been a bigger priority sooner, had it not been for the reticence of former Council President Donald Tusk. Michel, by contrast, as the former prime minister of Belgium, has a far deeper interest in Africa and has longstanding ties with many African leaders.\n\nOther officials said that the 2020 pivot was a natural outgrowth of a long string of initiatives over the years \u2014 including Juncker\u2019s 2018 speech \u2014 designed to engage with Africa that simply hadn\u2019t gotten much attention beyond tallies of development aid.\n\nBrussels hopes that its new investment of political capital will be impossible to ignore.\n\nThis article was changed to reflect the latest official tally of EU commissioners who traveled to Africa.\n\nThis article is part of POLITICO's EU in Africa series.

{"title": "Scandinavia seeks to launder its dirty-money image", "text": "This article is part of the special report Europe's dirty (money) secret.\n\nSTOCKHOLM \u2014 On a recent weekday, at the headquarters of Swedish lender Swedbank, in the Nordic country\u2019s capital, Chief Executive Jens Henriksson admitted his bank\u2019s failings.\n\n\u201cSwedbank has not done what it takes to stop money laundering,\u201d Henriksson told reporters. \u201cIt has not had good enough governance or internal controls,\u201d he said.\n\nHenriksson\u2019s frank admissions are part of a wider reckoning underway in Scandinavia, as a region of the world that prides itself on a squeaky-clean image grapples with a spate of dirty-money scandals.\n\nA banking sector long seen as a model of transparency has, at least in its dealings in the Baltics, shown itself to be something far more opaque.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to see any weak link in the EU that criminals could exploit\u201d \u2014 Vera Jourov\u00e1, former European commissioner for justice\n\nAs Henriksson spoke, Swedbank had just been fined 4 billion Swedish kronor (\u20ac370 million) by the Swedish financial regulator for lax controls on massive suspected money laundering at its Baltic branches, while an external report commissioned by Swedbank itself had found similar faults and laid them out in a 218-page report.\n\nDenmark\u2019s biggest lender, Danske Bank, has also faced severe censure for allowing huge flows of largely Russian money to pass through its Estonian branch without adequate checks.\n\nSweden\u2019s SEB bank is also facing questions about its Baltic operations.\n\nIll-gotten gains\n\nAt the European Union level, the emergence of Scandinavian banks as a weak link in the fight against money laundering is a wake-up call for the Commission as it deploys a fifth anti-money laundering directive for member countries to follow.\n\nMoney laundering, the process by which criminals use banks and other businesses to make ill-gotten assets appear legitimate, is a huge problem for authorities globally.\n\nThe United Nations estimates that between 2 percent and 5 percent of global economic output, which is between \u20ac715 billion and \u20ac1.87 trillion, is laundered each year.\n\nWhen Scandinavian banks entered the Baltic states in the early 2000s, it was hoped that they would be guarantors against the kind of financial malfeasance that had by then become widespread in other parts of the former Soviet Union.\n\nThat such malfeasance should seemingly find its way inside the Baltic operations of well-respected institutions like Swedbank and Danske Bank is a sign of the EU\u2019s vulnerability to flows of dirty cash, something its leaders are scrambling to reduce.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to see any weak link in the EU that criminals could exploit,\u201d the then-European Commissioner for Justice Vera Jourov\u00e1 said last year as the problem in Scandinavia was escalating. \u201cThe recent scandals have shown that member states should treat this as a matter of urgency.\u201d\n\nSwedbank\u2019s time in the Baltics dates back to 1998 when it invested in locally based Hansabank before buying it fully in 2005, a year after Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania entered the EU.\n\nDanske Bank bought Finland\u2019s Sampo Bank in 2006, giving the Danish lender control of Sampo\u2019s Baltic business.\n\nThe idea that there were problems with potential money laundering within Danske\u2019s and Swedbank\u2019s Baltic operations began to emerge in 2017 in reporting by investigative journalists from a range of outlets, including the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project, Denmark\u2019s Berlingske and Sweden\u2019s SVT.\n\nRegulators in the Baltics, Scandinavia and the United States began investigations into potential breaches of anti-money laundering rules.\n\nAs it became increasingly clear that the banks would need to come clean with the regulators, Danske and Swedbank both ordered in-depth reports from external law firms to map the extent of the problem.\n\nThese reports, published in 2018 by Bruun & Hjejle for Danske and in 2020 by Clifford Chance for Swedbank, showed how the heart of the problem was with what were termed \u201cnonresident\u201d clients, customers based outside the Baltics who held accounts in the Baltics.\n\nThese customers, often based in Russia, the reports showed, used Swedbank and Danske to make huge quantities of suspect payments: In Danske\u2019s case, payments of around \u20ac200 billion between 2007 and 2015 were identified as high risk for money laundering, and for Swedbank, the figure was around \u20ac37 billion between 2014 and 2019.\n\nReputational damage\n\nFor the two banks, the drip feed of bad news has been devastating in several ways.\n\nBoth saw dramatic swings in their share price and faced hefty fines by financial regulators. Danske is still waiting to hear exactly how much it must pay.\n\nExecutives also lost their jobs: Danske fired its chief executive Thomas Borgen in 2018 and Swedbank\u2019s Birgitte Bonnesen was ousted last year. Bonnesen could still face criminal charges for her role in the scandal, Swedish media reported in late April.\n\nMeanwhile, the reputational damage to both the banks and their home markets could also be significant.\n\nAs news of the Swedbank scandal was breaking, Swedish Prime Minister Stefan L\u00f6fven expressed his outrage.\n\n\u201cThis is totally unacceptable and destroys the whole credibility of the financial system,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cIt risks spoiling our nations\u2019 reputations,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe need a financial system that actually works for ordinary people and companies,\u201d he added. \u201cIt should work for a good development of society, not for organized crime.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt must be one of the worst pieces of business Swedbank has ever done\u201d \u2014 Jens Henriksson, CEO of Swedbank\n\nJoacim Olsson, the chief executive of the Swedish Shareholders\u2019 Association, a lobbying group which represents the interests of private shareholders, has been critical of the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority.\n\nIn early 2019, Olsson told Swedish public service broadcaster SVT that, in his view, the authority had been slow to react to signs of money laundering in the Baltic branches of Swedish banks \u2014 and when it finally did act, its initial analysis was badly flawed.\n\n\u201cThey chose to say that there were unlikely to be big problems within the Swedish banking operations in the Baltics, and that was obviously an incorrect conclusion,\u201d he said.\n\nAt Swedbank headquarters, Henriksson, the chief executive appointed in August 2019 to lead a cleanup, presented the bank\u2019s first-quarter earnings numbers.\n\nThe regulatory fine and the cost of the Clifford Chance report had totaled 6.7 billion Swedish kronor, sending the bank into the red.\n\nThe \u201cnonresident\u201d portfolio in the Baltics, which he said had earned \u201ca few hundred million over a few years,\u201d had cost the bank dearly both financially and in terms of the trust it must now work hard to rebuild, he said.\n\n\u201cIt must be one of the worst pieces of business Swedbank has ever done,\u201d Henriksson told POLITICO.", "link": "https://www.politico.eu/article/the-north-relaunders/", "published": "2020-05-15T03:30:35+00:00", "author": ["Charlie Duxbury", "Bjarke Smith-Meyer"]}, {"title": "Wanted: A watchdog, with teeth, to sniff out dirty money", "text": "This article is part of the special report Europe's dirty (money) secret.\n\nThe European Commission is hell-bent on creating a watchdog to enforce the bloc\u2019s anti-money laundering rules. But skeptics fear it won\u2019t have much bite.\n\nExecutive Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis sounded a rallying call for a European authority last week as the Brussels executive launched an action plan for tackling illicit funds flowing through the EU.\n\n\u201cWhat we should be aiming for is a strong EU supervisor, which can act in case of failure, for example, of national supervisors to act,\u201d the Latvian European commissioner said in an interview. \u201cWe have strong, strict anti-money laundering rules, but enforcement is uneven.\u201d\n\nThe Commission\u2019s action plan also outlines initiatives to harmonize and update anti-money laundering safeguards across the bloc while improving communication channels among financial intelligence units, the agencies in each country that analyze information from banks and other businesses obliged to report on suspicious activities.\n\n\u201cLook at Malta. They said they\u2019d clean up to join the EU, and look at them today\u201d \u2014 Karel Lannoo, the Centre for European Policy Studies\u2019 chief executive in Brussels\n\nThe plans are open for input from the public until July 29, in preparation for legislative proposals scheduled for early 2021.\n\nProgress could prove slow, some Treasury officials and think tankers warned. National interests and general opposition to handing too much power to a European authority could stifle the Commission\u2019s plans.\n\nEstonia \u2014 home to multiple cases in the past two years \u2014 as well as Hungary and Poland have already dismissed the need for a new EU watchdog. More will feel the same way, according to Karel Lannoo, the Centre for European Policy Studies\u2019 chief executive in Brussels.\n\n\u201cOn a political level, there is lip service that they want to do this,\u201d said Lannoo, who argues the EU would be better off harmonizing reporting requirements for supervised companies and improving communication among capitals, rather than pursuing a new watchdog.\n\n\u201cLook at Malta. They said they\u2019d clean up to join the EU, and look at them today,\u201d he continued, pointing to the island nation\u2019s so-called golden passports that grant investors citizenship in exchange for cash. The practice creates risks of money laundering, corruption and tax evasion, Brussels has warned. Cyprus offers a similar program.\n\nThe coronavirus could also prove an obstacle, Treasury and Commission officials warned. The pandemic has political priority at the moment, and governments might be reluctant to spend money on other issues.\n\nDombrovskis is undeterred. A series of scandals in Denmark, Estonia, Germany, Latvia, Malta, the Netherlands and Sweden since 2018 have laid bare the EU\u2019s lack of enforcement. The coronavirus has only pushed money laundering online, he said.\n\n\u201cOur experience of recent years concerning [anti-money laundering] has helped to concentrate minds,\u201d said the 48-year-old former prime minister, speaking by phone from his office in the Berlaymont headquarters, which is operating with reduced staff to avoid spreading the coronavirus.\n\nThe Commission estimates that around 1 percent of EU wealth is involved in \u201csuspect activity\u201d \u2014 some \u20ac160 billion.\n\nLoopholes\n\nGovernments for years have been interpreting EU directives differently when writing them into their respective national statues, leaving loopholes for criminals to exploit.\n\nSome but not all countries require businesses such as crowdfunding platforms and diamond dealers to report suspicious transactions, according to the Commission. Limits on cash payments and the asset-freezing powers of authorities also differ by country.\n\nThe situation is exasperated by a lack of communication among national authorities, the action plan said.\n\nLoopholes and lax enforcement have meant U.S. authorities have repeatedly had to step in to clean up the bloc\u2019s mess \u2014 leaving EU policymakers red-faced.\n\nIt took a press release from the U.S. Treasury in February 2018 to bring down Latvia\u2019s third-largest lender, ABLV Bank. The Treasury\u2019s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network accused it of laundering money involved in the North Korean weapons program. A month later, U.S. authorities in New York arrested the chairman of Malta\u2019s Pilatus Bank on charges including bank fraud and money laundering.\n\nSupervisors at the European Central Bank were ignorant of the illicit activity because money laundering is out of their remit. EU governments kept the policing duties for themselves rather than handing it to the ECB when they put the Frankfurt body in charge of supervising lenders six years ago.\n\nThat has to change now, Dombrovskis said, calling for a watchdog that can scrutinize banks as well as national authorities for bad behavior \u2014 and punish them accordingly.\n\nQuestion of ambition\n\nThe Commission\u2019s action plan lays out two possible watchdogs that the EU can introduce \u2014 both of which have \u201cpluses and minuses,\u201d Dombrovskis said.\n\nOne option involves setting an agency up from scratch, allowing legislators to design a dedicated supervisor with a mandate to investigate beyond the financial industry, into businesses such as gambling.\n\nThe setup process could take a while, the 18-page document said, leaving criminals more time to wash their illicit funds. Establishing a new body could also prove expensive, something Treasury officials say could prove a problem after governments have spent trillions of euros to prop up their economies during the coronavirus outbreak.\n\n\u201cThat money aspect might play a role,\u201d one skeptical official said.\n\nThe second, cheaper, option would be expanding the role of the EU\u2019s existing banking regulator. The European Banking Authority is already staffing up its anti-money laundering team to 16 people as part of a remit to make sure national supervisors are enforcing the rules properly.\n\nStill, industry enforcement would require many times that number. The Paris agency comes with its other problems, as well. The regulator\u2019s board is made of up the bloc\u2019s national supervisors, who have been reluctant to reprimand each other for their own shortcomings.\n\nFor example, the board decided last year to let Denmark and Estonia off the hook for not noticing that Danske Bank had funneled some \u20ac200 billion of suspicious funds through its Estonian branch for more than 6,000 \u201cnon-resident\u201d clients between 2007 and 2015.\n\n\u201cThe fact that they failed to act on one of the largest scandals in Europe ... shows that there are needs for more effective governance, decision-making structure and move away from an assembly of national supervisors,\u201d said Dombrovskis, who\u2019s been openly critical of the decision.\n\nThe EBA would also be limited to supervising the financial sector, the action plan said, leaving \u201cweak links in the EU supervisory network\u201d that should cover a welter of other businesses, from casinos to art galleries to real estate agents.\n\nThe point is far from lost on EU lawmakers. \u201cImproving the governance of the EBA is of course needed, but this does not make a banking authority a good supervisor against financial crime,\u201d Sven Giegold, a German Green in the European Parliament, said in a statement.\n\nNational interests\n\nThe governments could still choose to stick with the EBA. France has been lobbying other capitals to strengthen the Paris-based agency since the fall \u2014 ramping up national tensions, three Treasury officials said.\n\n\u201cThere is a feeling that anything that emanates from an institution based in Paris has a particularly French feel to it,\u201d one of the officials said. \u201cIt would fit perfectly with French processes and systems but could be a nightmare for other member states to implement.\u201d\n\nA spokeswoman for France\u2019s finance ministry rejected those claims, saying France is focused on finding the right solutions to crack down on dirty money rather than squabbling over the geographical locations of a European supervisor.\n\n\u201cThe impact of COVID-19 is hard to underestimate\u201d \u2014 Eero Hein\u00e4luoma, Finnish MEP\n\n\u201cWe believe that the EBA could provide a more cost-effective option,\u201d and it \u201ccould yield concrete results more rapidly,\u201d she added. \u201cIt is one option, and the decision on the supervisor\u2019s structure will only come at a later stage once we have agreed on its mandate and competence.\u201d\n\nEither way, countries need to put their disagreements aside, said MEP Eero Hein\u00e4luoma of Finland, who leads the Socialists & Democrats on anti-money laundering measures. He said EU citizens need to feel like politicians are working together to fight illicit financiers \u2014 especially in the current crisis.\n\n\u201cThe impact of COVID-19 is hard to underestimate,\u201d Hein\u00e4luoma told POLITICO.\n\n\u201cIn such a difficult societal context, where thousands of people risk losing their jobs and/or will have seen their standard of living lowered, it is unimaginable that there will be no political willingness to step up the European cooperation against money laundering,\u201d he said.\n\nThis article is part of POLITICO\u2019s premium policy service: Pro Financial Services.

The 'total and complete shutdown' of Muslims entering the U.S.\n\nWith the country rattled by the San Bernardino shooting in which a Muslim husband and wife massacred 14 and wounded 21 others, Trump's came out on Monday with a doozy of a statement, calling for a \"total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what is going on.\"\n\n\n\nWhile the proposal triggered condemnation from most candidates in both parties, Trump said it was necessary to protect the homeland.\n\n\"Without looking at the various polling data, it is obvious to anybody the hatred is beyond comprehension. Where this hatred comes from and why we will have to determine,\" he said in a statement released through his campaign. \"Until we are able to determine and understand this problem and the dangerous threat it poses, our country cannot be the victims of horrendous attacks by people that believe only in Jihad, and have no sense of reason or respect for human life. If I win the election for President, we are going to Make America Great Again.\"\n\nIn a telephone interview with MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" on Tuesday, Trump summarized his message for Muslims: \u201cWe love you, we want to work with you, we want you to turn in the bad ones, we want you to practice vigilance, we know that if you know a lot, in many cases, we want you to turn in the bad ones. We all want to get along. We want to get back to a normal, peaceful life.\"\n\n2. 'I'm a negotiator like you folks'\n\nThe previous week, Trump addressed the Republican Jewish Coalition on Dec. 3, calling himself \"a negotiator like you folks,\" one of many Jewish stereotypes the Manhattan real-estate mogul dropped throughout his speech.\n\n\u201cIs there anyone in this room who doesn\u2019t negotiate deals?\u201d he joked. \u201cProbably more than any room I\u2019ve ever spoken.\u201d He also generated some boos for not answering whether he would support moving the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem from its current location in Tel Aviv.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not going to support me even though I\u2019ll be the best guy for Israel,\u201d he told the audience, remarking that he did not expect much support from them.\n\n3. 'the blacks'\n\n\u201cI have a great relationship with the blacks. I\u2019ve always had a great relationship with the blacks,\" Trump told Albany's Talk 1300 in April 2011 as he mulled a run for the presidency at that time, which he did not ultimately pursue.\n\n4. 'I am the least racist person there is'\n\nIn May 2011, Trump pointed to the fact that an African American man, Randall Pinkett, won the fourth season of his NBC show \"The Apprentice\" as evidence that he is the \"least racist person there is.\"\n\nIn a telephone interview with \"Fox and Friends,\" Trump was asked to account for a campaign by an African American advocacy group trying to get then-\"Celebrity Apprentice\" contestants Lil Jon and Star Jones to condemn him for \"race-baiting.\"\n\n\"Well, you know, when it comes to racism and racists, I am the least racist person there is. And I think most people that know me would tell you that. I am the least racist, I\u2019ve had great relationships,\" Trump said. \"In fact, Randall Pinkett won, on the as you know, on 'The Apprentice' a little while ago, a couple of years ago. And Randall\u2019s been outstanding in every way. So I mean, I am the least racist person.\"\n\n5. 'Laziness is a trait in blacks'\n\n\u201cI have black guys counting my money. \u2026 I hate it,\" Trump told John R. O'Donnell, the former president of Trump Plaza Hotel & Casino, according O'Donnell's account in his 1991 book \"Trumped!\" \"The only guys I want counting my money are short guys that wear yarmulkes all day.\"\n\nTrump, according to O'Donnell, went on to say, \"'Laziness is a trait in blacks. It really is, I believe that.\"\n\nIn an interview with Playboy in 1999, Trump remarked that \"[t]he stuff O'Donnell wrote about me is probably true. The guy's a f----g loser. A f----g loser. I brought the guy in to work for me; it turns out he didn't know that much about what he was doing. I think I met the guy two or three times total. And this guy goes off and writes a book about me, like he knows me!\"\n\n6. 'a well-educated black'\n\nIn an interview with NBC News in September 1989, Trump remarked, \"A well-educated black has a tremendous advantage over a well-educated white in terms of the job market.\"\n\nHe continued: \"If I were starting off today, I would love to be a well-educated black, because I believe they do have an actual advantage.\"\n\n7. 'They're rapists ... some, I assume, are good people'\n\nTrump kicked off his presidential campaign on June 16 from the Trump Tower in Manhattan, and immediately touched off a furor with his comments about immigration.\n\n\"When Mexico sends its people, they\u2019re not sending their best. They\u2019re not sending you. They\u2019re not sending you. They\u2019re sending people that have lots of problems, and they\u2019re bringing those problems with us. They\u2019re bringing drugs. They\u2019re bringing crime. They\u2019re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people,\" Trump said at his campaign announcement. \"But I speak to border guards and they tell us what we\u2019re getting. And it only makes common sense. It only makes common sense. They\u2019re sending us not the right people. It\u2019s coming from more than Mexico. It\u2019s coming from all over South and Latin America, and it\u2019s coming probably\u2014 probably\u2014 from the Middle East. But we don\u2019t know. Because we have no protection and we have no competence, we don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening. And it\u2019s got to stop and it\u2019s got to stop fast.\"\n\n8. 'I have thousands of Hispanics that work for me'\n\nAddressing news of a coalition of Hispanic organizations protesting his hosting appearance on \"Saturday Night Live,\" Trump was frank.\n\n\"I\u2019m leading in the polls with the Hispanics. I mean, you look at Nevada, I\u2019m leading in the polls with the Hispanics because I produce jobs, and they know it. I have thousands of Hispanics that work for me, my relationships to Hispanics is better than those groups,\" he told \"Fox and Friends\" in an Oct. 19 interview. \"Those groups are looking to fundraise; I know all about those groups.\"\n\n9. No bones about it\n\nFollowing blowback from the comments regarding Mexican immigrants and rapists, Trump sought to tamp down the controversy with comments to \"Entertainment Tonight\" on July 1.\n\n\"I don't have a racist bone in my body,\" Trump told the show. \"The fact that I want a strong border and the fact that I don't want illegal immigrants pouring into this country, that doesn't make me a racist, it means I love this country and I want to save this country.\"\n\n10. 'the Japs'\n\nSpeaking to Time magazine for a profile published in January 1989, Trump was asked to give an estimate of his total wealth.\n\n\"Who the f knows? I mean, really, who knows how much the Japs will pay for Manhattan property these days?\" he asked in response, using a racial slur for the Japanese.\n\n11. On how to treat women\n\nIn a New York magazine profile published in November 1992, a year after Trump divorced his first wife, Ivana, Trump was quoted dispensing his wisdom about how to handle the fairer sex.\n\n\"You have to treat 'em like shit,\" Trump said in the article to friend Philip Johnson, who responded, \"You'd make a good mafioso.\"\n\nTrump's response: \"One of the greatest.\"\n\n12. 'I cherish women'\n\nDays after sparking outrage by remarking that Fox News debate moderator Megyn Kelly had \"blood coming out of her wherever,\" a remark he later clarified to mean her nose, Trump tried to play up his positive image with women in an interview with CNN's Jake Tapper.\n\n\u201cI cherish women. I want to help women,\" he said in an Aug. 9 interview. \"I\u2019m going to be able to do things for women that no other candidate would be able to do, and it's very important to me.\u201d\n\nThe line became part of his stump speeches, drawing some criticism in itself. Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton remarked in September that she would rather Trump \"stop cherishing women and start respecting women.\u201d\n\nAt an October No Labels event in New Hampshire, a member of the audience told him, \"Maybe I'm wrong ... but I don't think you're a friend to women.\"\n\nTrump interrupted, insisting, \"I respect women incredibly\" and noting the number of women who work for him and the opportunities he has provided them.\n\n13. Rosie O'Donnell, Bette Midler, Arianna Huffington...\n\nMegyn Kelly drew fire from Trump in the first debate for asking him about his psst remarks about women, specifically of Rosie O'Donnell, of whom he remarked in 2006 to \"Entertainment Tonight\": \u201cRosie O\u2019Donnell\u2019s disgusting. I mean, both inside and out. You take a look at her, she\u2019s a slob.\"\n\n\u201cRosie\u2019s a person that\u2019s very lucky to have her girlfriend. And she better be careful or I\u2019ll send one of my friends over to pick up her girlfriend,\" Trump continued. \"Why would she stay with Rosie if she had another choice?\u201d\n\nO'Donnell is far from the only famous woman to feel Trump's scorn. He also tweeted about actress Bette Midler (\"grotesque\") and publisher Arianna Huffington on separate occasions.\n\nNow grotesque @BetteMidler is into the Trump act --- trying to become relevant again. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 28, 2012\n\n.@ariannahuff is unattractive both inside and out. I fully understand why her former husband left her for a man- he made a good decision. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 28, 2012\n\nHuffington Post is just upset that I said its purchase by AOL has been a disaster and that Arianna Huffington is ugly both inside and out! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 20, 2014\n\n14. 'When a man leaves a woman'\n\nAmid his divorce from Ivana, Trump summed up in a September 1990 Vanity Fair article the press' obsession with his soon-to-be ex-wife as such:\n\n\u201cWhen a man leaves a woman, especially when it was perceived that he has left for a piece of ass\u2014a good one!\u2014 there are 50 percent of the population who will love the woman who was left.\u201d\n\n15. Golf and marriage\n\nSpeaking to The New York Times for an article published in May 2011, Trump likened homosexual relationships to changing tastes in golf equipment.\n\n\u201cA lot of people \u2014 I don\u2019t want this to sound trivial \u2014 but a lot of people are switching to these really long putters, very unattractive,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s weird. You see these great players with these really long putters, because they can\u2019t sink three-footers anymore. And, I hate it. I am a traditionalist.\"\n\n\"I have so many fabulous friends who happen to be gay, but I am a traditionalist,\" he said.", "link": "https://www.politico.eu/article/15-most-offensive-things-trump-campaign-feminism-migration-racism/", "published": "2015-12-08T21:21:58+00:00", "author": ["Nick Gass", "Vince Chadwick", "Paul Dallison", "Benjamin Cunningham"]}, {"title": "The world after coronavirus", "text": "The world we knew before COVID-19 is gone. The one that comes after is still at least partly up to us.\n\nThe crisis has put entire countries under lockdown, devastated countless businesses, killed hundreds of thousands of people and upended hundreds of millions, if not billions, of lives.\n\nThe question now: What comes next?\n\nAs the world begins to look at what it will be like to live life with the coronavirus \u2014 or the threat of future outbreaks \u2014 it\u2019s already clear that the pandemic has the potential to disrupt industries, accelerate cultural and economic trends, or be used by policymakers or advocates gunning for transformative agendas.\n\nPOLITICO journalists asked dozens of experts and policymakers what they believe the epidemic will \u2014 or, in their view, should \u2014 change. Here are their answers.\n\nIf current trends continue, the coronavirus crisis will...\n\n... kill the office.\n\nThe commercial real estate market stands to take a serious hit because of the coronavirus crisis. Many businesses are not expected to reopen once the crisis passes \u2014 leaving much unoccupied office space. Others may allow their employees to continue working from home and opt to save cash by taking advantage of more flexible co-working spaces.\n\nDespite occasional frustrations that come with remote working, managers in some industries have discovered how practical videoconferencing can be. \"It\u2019s much more effective than having hundreds of meeting[s],\" said Warsaw Mayor Rafa\u0142 Trzaskowski, \"only now people realize how easy it is to use them.\u201d Hubertus Heil, Germany's labor minister, is drafting a law to give people the right to work from home even after the crisis.\n\nAccording to consulting firm Global Workplace Analytics, two years from now up to 30 percent of workers could be working from home multiple days per week.\n\nThe vacated commercial spaces may be of use to cities like Madrid, Rome and Amsterdam, which for years have struggled with a housing crisis and rising residential rents.\n\nEven offices that continue to function will have to adjust in order to prepare for the pandemics that scientists cited by the World Economic Forum predict will be increasingly common in the future because of globalization and climate change.\n\nPaternoster lifts and \u201cShabbat elevators\u201d \u2014 which run without anyone having to press germ-covered buttons \u2014 could become more common, and office spaces are likely to be more spaced out, as evidenced by examples like the Six Feet Office developed by real estate services firm Cushman & Wakefield.\n\n\u2014 Aitor Hern\u00e1ndez-Morales\n\n... devastate the restaurant sector.\n\nIt's hard to imagine Europe not returning to its culture of eating out and open-air caf\u00e9s. But even when the lockdowns are over, the experience of China shows that people are very reluctant to return to dining out.\n\nAccording to Adrian Cummins, a board member of HOTREC, a hospitality trade body, it will take some time before the situation for restaurants returns to anywhere near how things were before the lockdowns.\n\n\"What we need to do in our sector now, which is the most important thing, is we need to restore confidence,\" he said. \"We need to make sure that consumers are confident that going to a restaurant is a right thing.\"\n\nIn China, the restaurants that have reopened have had to introduce extra safety measures: masks for staff, sufficient spacing between tables, and temperature checks. Similar measures could soon be introduced in Europe, which may make it hard for restaurants that make it through the immediate crisis to operate. Spacing out diners inevitably means fewer covers \u2014 and that could be enough to kill off many businesses.\n\nEven if consumers want to eat out, they might find their favorite places are gone. Cummins estimates that in Ireland, where he lives, 40-50 percent of restaurants might not reopen. That is why, he says, the European Commission and national governments should help businesses with non-refundable grant aid or zero-percent loans.\n\n\u2014 Zosia Wanat\n\n... shorten food supply chains.\n\nOne of the first tangible impacts of the coronavirus that most Europeans witnessed outside hospitals was the panic-buying and empty shelves fueled by fears of shortages. Later, national border restrictions made it hard for truckers to transport goods across countries and for seasonal farmworkers to harvest fields.\n\nSome argue the crisis should prompt profound reflection on the relationship between Europeans and our food, from what we're eating now under lockdown, to what we should be eating when it's all over \u2014 as well as where it comes from.\n\nThe European Agriculture Commissioner Janusz Wojciechowski argues that one of the main lessons is that Europe needs to grow its own crops, so it depends less on outside sources and bolsters the bloc's own food security.\n\n\u201cWe have to have our own food, produced on our fields, by our own farmers, and we have to take better care of local markets, shorten those supply chains,\u201d he said in an interview with POLITICO.\n\nFarming is already heavily subsidized by the Common Agricultural Policy, and the bloc is a net food exporter. But within the EU, the food supply in some individual countries is reliant on transportation and workers from abroad.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s absolutely no doubt in my mind that there\u2019ll be more and more calls for re-localized, 're-territorialized' food systems,\u201d said Olivier De Schutter, co-chair of the International Panel of Experts on Sustainable Food Systems. \"Never before has there been such an incredible interest in short supply chains,\u201d he added.\n\nDe Schutter said the EU could improve some of its policies \u2014 on public procurement, competition, the CAP scheme and its nascent Farm to Fork strategy to improve sustainability \u2014 to give advantages to local, smaller and organic farmers.\n\n\u2014 Zosia Wanat\n\n... encourage people to eat better.\n\nThe crisis has also changed consumers' relationship with their food. National lockdowns and restaurant closures have nudged Europeans into their kitchens to bake bread and banana cake and more interesting evening meals. Many are also choosing the closest grocer to them, instead of opting for shopping at big supermarkets.\n\nAccording to a YouGov survey conducted at the beginning of April, 42 percent of British people said they value food more than they did before the crisis, 38 percent reported cooking more often from scratch, and 33 percent said they throw away less food.\n\nThe poll also showed a clear majority wanted to see at least some of the personal or social changes they have experienced over the last month continue.\n\n\"Our expectation is that hopefully the consumers are going to regain some of the respect for food that previous generations had,\" said Mette Lykke, the CEO of Too Good To Go, an app that aims to reduce food waste. \"For a long time, we haven\u2019t really appreciated the true value of our food; we\u2019ve just taken it for granted.\n\n\"[Most people] have actually realized that we can live in a quite different way and still be pretty well off,\" Lykke said, adding that consumers might turn to better-quality food. \"A lot of this stuff we used to buy, we might not necessarily be interested in anymore.\"\n\nThe pandemic has led to a surge in demand for organic and sustainable foods, according to Ecovia Intelligence, a research company. In France, for example, some organic food shops are reporting sales increases of over 40 percent.\n\n\u2014 Zosia Wanat\n\n... expand protections for gig workers.\n\nThe coronavirus crisis has divided workers into two classes: those who can work from home, and those forced to risk infection. While online platforms such as Uber and Deliveroo argue that their model offers people flexibility and control over their earnings, the crisis has shown how little freedom workers really have.\n\nThe digital proletariat \u2014 those working for food-delivery, ride-hailing and e-commerce platforms \u2014 have little choice but to show up in order to serve remote customers. \u201cThe myth of the empowered gig economy worker has been fatally wounded by the COVID-19 crisis,\u201d said Nicola Countouris, professor of labor law at University College London.\n\nGovernments will have to rethink social protections and labor rights for new kinds of work, especially as the newly laid-off turn to platforms for income. \u201cThere is going to be an increase of online work, but it won\u2019t all be of good quality and with enough protection, especially not in times of shock,\u201d said Anna Thomas, director of the Institute for the Future of Work.\n\nAs the number of precarious workers grows, policy debates will heat up around how gig worker should be classified and support for policies like a universal basic income may gain traction, Thomas said. Spain has announced it is rolling out universal basic income permanently. If it succeeds, others may follow.\n\nGig economy companies have been adamant that their workers should not be classed as \"employees.\" That means that many are not entitled to employee protection from the state, nor to bailouts for businesses offered to help them weather the crisis. Once COVID-19 subsides, that will be harder to sustain.\n\n\u2014 Melissa Heikkil\u00e4\n\n... move grocery shopping online.\n\nWith consumers too scared to leave their homes to shop for groceries, retailers have had no choice but to go online. Some of them, like Britain's Tesco or Belgium's Delhaize, already had online platforms, while others have had to get creative.\n\nFrance's Carrefour teamed up with UberEats to boost its delivery service, while Poland's biggest retailer Biedronka started to partner with the Spanish startup Glovo to deliver food to customers' doorsteps. Some smaller stores, such as the Parisian organic shop Kilogramme, built their own e-commerce services within 24 hours.\n\nThis trend will continue when the crisis is over, said Christian Verschueren, director general of EuroCommerce, a trade body. \"If we learned one thing through this [crisis, it] is that digital transformation has been accelerated and will be accelerated,\" he said.\n\n\"People who have never gone online for their groceries have now started to go online for groceries,\u201d he added. \u201cI think all food retailers have seen an increase in e-commerce, and I think that will definitely not go away.\"\n\nCould that mean supermarkets as we know them will disappear, or will be run by machines? In the U.S., Amazon's technology for cashier-free shops is becoming increasingly popular, but in Europe the change might not come that fast.\n\nVerschueren said the robotization of retail on the Continent will continue \u2014 think more contactless payment options and self-checkouts to reduce opportunities to transmit the virus \u2014 but the technology can't totally replace human workers, especially in times of crisis.\n\n\"Even with the best artificial intelligence and the best robotization, I don\u2019t think the sector would have been able to deal better with the supply, because at the end of the day, it\u2019s actually the human invention and the human resilience that was able to cope with an increasing demand,\" he said.\n\n\u2014 Zosia Wanat\n\n... make the bicycle king.\n\nWill bicycles rule the post-corona city? Campaigners and local officials hope so.\n\nFrom Berlin to Bogot\u00e1, and Vancouver to Milan, cities are already taking steps to broaden bike lanes to allow people to cycle while keeping a safe social distance from others. City residents are also enjoying the cleaner air from a massive drop in city traffic \u2014 a feature of lockdown life they may want to retain after restrictions begin to ease.\n\n\u201cMoving around on bike or on foot is \u2026 the only real pandemic-resilient mobility there is,\u201d a coalition of activists wrote in an open letter to German Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer earlier this month.\n\nUrban mobility is a zero-sum game: The more space is given to cyclists, the more restrictions need to be imposed on cars. With vehicle traffic suppressed, campaigners see an opportunity to make a shift to two-wheeled transport, although it remains to be seen whether commuters will stay out of their cars once confinement restrictions are lifted \u2014 particularly if they are nervous about public transport.\n\nIn Brussels, authorities are moving to impose a 20-kilometer-per-hour speed limit on motor vehicles within the congested center to give more space to cyclists and pedestrians.\n\n\u201cThe changes have to be permanent to be an improvement,\u201d said Morten Kabell, a former mayor for environmental affairs in Copenhagen and co-CEO of the European Cyclists\u2019 Federation. \u201cWider and more bicycle lanes can transport more people than car lanes can \u2026 and it\u2019s cheaper to build bike infrastructure.\u201d\n\nSpain\u2019s environment minister, Teresa Ribera, has backed efforts to shift transport infrastructure, while France\u2019s environment minister, \u00c9lisabeth Borne, has said she\u2019s making cash available for cities to extend cycling paths during the pandemic. Campaigners across Germany are calling for wider bike lanes, strict speed limits and \u201clarger, car-free shared spaces.\u201d They also want to turn entire neighborhoods into bike-only zones.\n\nIn an effort to create more public space for people to walk around without being crammed on narrow sidewalks, Vienna has banned cars on some streets to create new \u201cmeeting zones\u201d instead.\n\n\u2014 Kalina Oroschakoff and Josh Posaner\n\n... redraw city maps.\n\n\"Think global, act local\" has long been the mantra of the environmental and social justice movements. The coronavirus crisis might help trigger its broader adoption, and change cities in the process.\n\nThe ongoing lockdown has expanded our digital and local lives while contracting physical and global ones. Mark Carney, the former governor of the Bank of England, argued in the Economist that the trend will continue. \"Even afterward, local resilience will be prized over global efficiency,\" he wrote.\n\nCity officials and campaigners are already pushing for a rethink of urban planning, to reclaim public space and improve local living. Months before the appearance of the coronavirus, Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo made the concept of the \u201c15-minute city\u201d a pillar of her reelection campaign.\n\nThe Socialist proposed turning the French capital into a collective of self-sufficient communities with everything \u2014 groceries, parks, gyms, health centers, schools and workplaces \u2014 just a 15-minute walk away from every resident\u2019s doorstep.\n\nCOVID-19-related restrictions have inadvertently turned Hidalgo\u2019s plan \u2014 which was meant to reduce the pollution and stress created by daily commutes \u2014 into a reality, with Parisians forbidden under most circumstances to stray more than 1 kilometer from their homes.\n\nIt would not be the first time that a crisis was used to revolutionize urban planning in Europe: Lisbon\u2019s utilitarian grid layout was developed as the Marquis of Pombal sought to rebuild the Portuguese capital after a devastating 1755 earthquake.\n\nFathers of the \u201cRed Vienna\u201d city sought to address the housing crisis created by post-WWI urban migration by building grand self-sufficient living communities, exemplified by Karl-Marx Hof, a massive, housing complex that contains schools, health clinics, athletic infrastructure, gardens, beauty salons and shops.\n\n\u2014 Kalina Oroschakoff and Aitor Hern\u00e1ndez-Morales\n\n... push public transport into the red.\n\nThe global health crisis is accelerating a shift away from cash payments for public transport. Bus drivers in Berlin and London, for example, are now sealed in their cabins, and tickets can no longer be bought on board.\n\nThat's accelerated the shift to app-based ticketing systems. And where physical ticket controls have vanished completely, some travelers are enjoying (effectively) free transit.\n\nEven once things start to gradually return to normal, decreased use of public transport will mean services will run way beneath profitability. Local authorities will have to provide major subsidies to maintain transport links, or risk the mothballing of tram and subway routes.\n\nEven before the pandemic, authorities in places such as Luxembourg and Vienna had already moved to make public transport free (or heavily discounted to \u20ac1 per day) as part of efforts to get cars off the road.\n\nOther transit changes will be more subtle, but are likely to stick. For example, carriage doors now open automatically on many subway systems, with messages for commuters to avoid regular touch points such as handles that could spread the infection.\n\nTo counter fears of contagion, Transport for London, the authority that manages and regulates the U.K. capital\u2019s transport network, has promised to deploy long-lasting anti-viral cleaning fluids.\n\n\u2014 Josh Posaner\n\n... ground the airline industry.\n\nVideoconferencing has taken the place of face-to-face meetings (and air miles that come with them) as big companies like Facebook, Rio Tinto and BP froze travel even before government lockdowns shuttered their employees at home.\n\nThe longer that continues, the less likely that the old corporate travel bonanza is to return. Companies will be able to evaluate closely how productivity under lockdown compares \u2014 and whether the millions spent on corporate travel are really worth it.\n\nWith the future uncertain, Facebook has ruled out holding events with more than 50 people until at least June 2021 and has banned business travel until at least June this year. Others may follow suit.\n\nAirlines are noticing. The airline lobby IATA is generally bullish when it comes to travel demand, but even its chief economist, Brian Pearce, admitted the forced break from air travel could change habits.\n\n\"If we see a bigger increase in videoconferencing technology as a substitute for business meetings, there is a possibility people might shun long-haul,\" he said. Airlines who had built their brand around adding \"a personal touch\" might have to rethink that too.\n\nOnce the crisis subsides, leisure travel may not be the same either. Under lockdown, people are staying closer to home, and it\u2019s unclear whether holidaymakers \u2014 nervous about what they might catch \u2014 will be itching to get on a plane once restrictions are lifted.\n\nNearby locations tend to be cheaper, and getting somewhere by car is less risky, at least from an infectious disease point of view, than being packed in a plane.\n\nRyanair CEO Michael O\u2019Leary says he will counter that thinking with a blitz of low ticket prices. He predicts that families cooped up in their homes will be desperate to fly once the shackles are off.\n\nHis competitors have taken a more conservative line. Many have deferred plane deliveries, believing it will take years before air travel returns to pre-pandemic levels.\n\n\u2014 Saim Saeed\n\n... change the airport experience.\n\nAirports have long been countries' gatekeepers, but the pandemic may require them to be de facto doctors too. Since the pandemic hit, numerous countries have installed facilities including temperature checks and COVID-19 testing equipment in terminals to screen passengers.\n\nFears of a second wave of the disease or some future pathogen mean those facilities might remain for longer than the outbreak itself. In some cases, airlines themselves are testing passengers for the disease.\n\nThe need for social distancing will also present challenges. Maintaining that in lines at security and immigration will require more space and different layouts.\n\nPassengers are also likely to find that they will encounter fewer staff while passing through security and into their plane, so as to minimize infection risk.\n\nDesign changes will also mean fewer opportunities to pick up an infection by touching surfaces. That means more cleaning, no check-in screens and more contactless security and identification checks.\n\nThe development of facial recognition technologies, long in the works, could be expedited to track passengers through the airport and reduce the need for physical checks \u2014 though such measures would come with privacy and surveillance concerns.\n\nWith a predicted recession and demand in free fall, companies and policymakers are also considering shelving airport expansion plans.\n\n\"Returning as quickly as possible to full operational capabilities under a 'new normal' ... will involve new requirements for our staff, facilities, services and processes,\" said lobby group ACI-Europe's Director General Olivier Jankovec.\n\n\"Understanding what these requirements will be and shaping them is of crucial importance, as well as addressing longer-term impacts on a full range of issues \u2014 from airport layout and equipment to our economic and business models.\"\n\n\u2014 Saim Saeed\n\n... expose tech giants as public utilities.\n\nIn times of crisis, people typically turn to government authorities for help. With COVID-19, they've also turned to Big Tech.\n\nFacebook has teamed up with national public health agencies to keep people informed; Google has peppered search results with the latest updates on how to keep safe; Amazon has become an arm of many countries' postal services, as people rely on the e-commerce giant for everything from groceries to toilet paper.\n\nThat trend \u2014 of treating some of Silicon Valley's biggest names as de facto public utilities \u2014 will not ebb as the number of global fatalities linked to the coronavirus eventually subsides.\n\nBy providing up-to-the-minute advice, guidance and logistics, these companies have cemented themselves in public life even more so than they had done pre-COVID-19. Pulling back from that will be difficult, if not impossible.\n\nThe consequences are likely to be felt across society. Regular interactions with government agencies and other public bodies will often also involve Big Tech. Think a national tax authority providing updates on WhatsApp, or Amazon delivering medical supplies to the elderly on behalf of a public heath agency. The lines between public bodies and these private companies will become blurred.\n\nThe effects of labeling Big Tech as public utilities could go two ways. It may cement their position in society, driving off competitors and making them quasi-equals to government agencies.\n\nOr it may force regulators to clamp down on their activities, limiting their revenue sources as is done with other public utilities. Much will depend on how these companies perform during the crisis \u2014 and how governments react in the aftermath.\n\n\u2014 Mark Scott\n\n... strip away privacy rights.\n\n\"Many short-term emergency measures will become a fixture of life. That is the nature of emergencies. They fast-forward historical processes,\" wrote Israeli philosopher Yuval Noah Harari in late March, as the West woke up to the fact that it too would have to deal with a deadly disease that many thought would remain far away.\n\nFor democracies that hold fundamental rights dear, that has meant some painful soul-searching as governments have turned to phone tracking and other surveillance measures to tame the outbreak.\n\nOfficials have trotted out reassurances \u2014 that these are extraordinary times, and that intrusive technology deployed now will be wound down once the crisis is over \u2014 but many fear the genie is now out of the bottle.\n\nAs the EU's data protection supervisor Wojciech Wiewi\u00f3rowski said at a webinar recently: \u201cIf we create the system of tracking \u2026 it will stay here.\"\n\nEven if we decide we want to \"come back to the world without the contact tracing, without the location tracking, the weapons, the tools will be around anyway,\" he added.\n\n\u2014 Vincent Manancourt\n\n... empower the EU in public health.\n\nEurope's initial response to the coronavirus looked chaotic and uncoordinated: flight bans, border closures and blocks on exports of protective gear by national capitals that weren't talking to each other.\n\nBrussels was a sideshow because it does not have much power over health matters. \u201cThe truth is that when it comes to public health, the Union has done what its member nations wanted it to do: not much,\u201d public health expert Scott Greer wrote in the New York Times.\n\nBut what if the EU could lay down the law \u2014 literally?\n\nThe crisis has convinced many that the current setup doesn't work. More than 6,000 people, including former prime ministers, commissioners and a Parliament president, signed a petition arguing that it is time to make health a shared EU competence, and give the bloc the ability to act as a federal state in health emergencies.\n\nProviding Brussels with more health competence \u2014 in some form at least \u2014 has also been backed by French President Emmanuel Macron and some current commissioners.\n\nUnder the health federalists\u2019 vision, Brussels could have acted earlier and more decisively by activating an EU-wide plan to harmonize testing and unify lockdown strategies.\n\nIt would have been able to purchase masses of protective gear from the outset. (It took weeks after a health ministers meeting before the EU launched its first procurement effort.)\n\nBrussels could have played air-traffic controller: moving medical staff to countries harder hit, and patients to countries with a greater capacity to treat them.\n\nSuch measures would mean a massive increase in power, which in turn would mean reopening EU treaties \u2014 an idea that strikes fear into the heart of even the most committed Europhile. But with scientists predicting the arrival of future pandemics, it could prove essential.\n\n\u2014 Jillian Deutsch\n\n\u2026 digitally transform the European Parliament.\n\nThe idea of an entirely digital European Parliament now doesn't looks so crazy.\n\n\u201cThis crisis is showing everybody that the digital world has arrived,\u201d said Esteban Gonz\u00e1lez Pons, a Spanish MEP and vice president of the conservative European People\u2019s Party. \u201cWe are at the beginning of the digital Parliament.\u201d\n\nIn March, Parliament President David Sassoli canceled all plenary sessions in Strasbourg until July, advised MEPs to work remotely and later introduced online voting and virtual committee meetings. The measures were unprecedented.\n\nGonz\u00e1lez Pons said that the need for MEPs to spend money on travel could be re-examined in the future, although scrapping trips to Strasbourg is \u201canother issue,\" he said, as \u201cwe are obliged by the treaties.\u201d\n\nOther MEPs saw the experience of going entirely digital as a way to improve their relationship with the outside world.\n\nNathalie Loiseau, a French MEP from the centrist Renew Europe group, said she will participate in a videoconference with MPs in France, \u201csomething we had struggled to put in place in normal times.\u201d\n\nDaniel Freund, a Green MEP from Germany, said he had organized webinars on EU-related themes \u201calmost every day\u201d since the lockdown started.\n\nBut for many, tech solutions are no substitute for face-to-face business. \u201cTechnical solutions do by no means replace physical meetings and social interaction,\u201d said German Socialist MEP Gabriele Bischoff.\n\nLoiseau, who is also the chairwoman of the Parliament's Defense and Security Subcommittee, agrees. \u201cClearly, the work conditions were not optimal. Everything took twice more time, we had to call each other before a meeting to prepare, and after the meeting to debrief. It\u2019s much less interactive.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Ma\u00efa de La Baume\n\n\u2026 turn the European Union inward.\n\nThe EU's geopolitical ambitions look increasingly likely to be a casualty of the crisis \u2014 at least in the short term.\n\nTo bolster the EU's nascent military capabilities \u2014 and hence diplomatic clout \u2014 the Commission originally proposed that the next long-term EU budget include a European Defense Fund of \u20ac13 billion, to promote military cooperation, plus a separate off-budget European Peace Facility of \u20ac10.5 billion for military operations.\n\nBut with economic survival now the priority \u2014 the International Monetary Fund expects the eurozone to contract by 7.5 percent this year \u2014 there will be urgent calls to put the bloc's money to other uses, diplomats say. \"In the short term ... in a moment of economic reconstruction, the last priority will be the military one,\u201d said Nathalie Tocci, director of the Istituto Affari Internazionali, a Rome-based think tank, and a special adviser to European High Representative for Foreign Affairs Josep Borrell.\n\nGeopolitical considerations will not be off the agenda forever though, she said. \"In the longer term, the theme will bounce back as the U.S. and China are on a [conflicting] path ... and it\u2019s increasingly clear that [it] is very expensive for us to be simply the battleground between the two superpowers,\u201d said Tocci.\n\nEU leaders stressed the bloc's \"strategic autonomy\" in a joint statement following their first virtual meeting in March shortly after lockdowns were imposed across Europe. That means the EU's ability to protect key assets and the goal of becoming less economically dependent on external actors such as China.\n\n\u201cWhat we have understood is that first we need to be less dependent and to have our economy back on track, then we can really play a role as a geopolitical actor,\u201d argued a senior EU diplomat. Others are less optimistic and say that with 27 different interests to reconcile, the goal of strategic autonomy \"could take decades to become real\u201d according to a second senior EU diplomat.\n\n\u2014 Jacopo Barigazzi\n\n... break the euro \u2014 or make it stronger.\n\nSince creating the euro, European leaders have dreamed that their shared currency will one day rival the almighty dollar.\n\nThe previous European Commission drew up a battle plan to use the euro as a counter to the U.S., whose stranglehold over dollar-denominated trade in commodities like oil lets it run unilateral policies such as sanctions on Iran \u2014 and impose fines on EU banks for violating them.\n\nCommission President Ursula von der Leyen has also taken up the challenge, mandating Executive Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis to make the euro a \u201cstrategic asset for our Union.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis will include increasing the global use of the euro for payments, as a reserve currency and for debt issuance,\u201d she wrote in his mission letter.\n\nFor that to happen, however, Europe will need strong economic growth, said Guntram Wolf, the director of the Brussels think tank Bruegel. Instead, the Continent is on course for its biggest decline since the Great Depression.\n\n\u201cNo one wants to invest in your economy if there\u2019s no growth,\u201d Wolf said, stressing the importance of the EU crafting an economic recovery fund. \u201cThe growth story is really, really important.\u201d\n\nEven if growth comes back strong, the euro club is lacking a safe asset for investors to buy, equivalent to U.S. Treasury securities. Northern European countries have repeatedly spurned the idea of shared euro bonds for fear that their taxpayers would be on the hook for the debt of supposedly profligate southern countries.\n\nIf the crisis doesn't end up breaking the euro, then there is hope, said Wolf. \u201cIf we can pick out a proper growth strategy and issue some joint debt, which would be sustainable on the side of stronger and weaker countries, then the EU can get out of the crisis strengthened \u2014 not weakened.\"\n\n\u2014 Bjarke Smith-Meyer\n\n... make experts great again.\n\nOne of the shared characteristics of the populist movements that, in their various incarnations, came to prominence in the past decade was a deliberate fostering of mistrust in established, academic, informed opinion.\n\nWho needs people who have studied a subject for years when you have a \u201cvery stable genius\u201d in the White House? Or when the U.K. public has \u201chad enough of experts\u201d?\n\nThe coronavirus may have changed that.\n\nIt\u2019s not just the sight of some those same populist figureheads now being flanked by their expert officials at daily press conferences. Scientists warned for years that a pandemic like this was not only possible but probable. Politicians concerned with the daily cut and thrust did not pay enough attention. They will now.\n\n\u201cAfter the COVID crisis, it\u2019s reasonable,\u201d wrote former Bank of England Governor Mark Carney in the Economist, \u201cto expect people to demand \u2026 more heed to be given to the advice of scientific experts.\u201d\n\nIn Carney\u2019s view, \u201cthe great test\u201d of whether a new attitude really prevails will be climate change \u2014 governments either mitigate in advance or people will suffer down the line. There is no social distancing from a heating climate.\n\nFrank Snowden, a history of medicine professor who specializes in how epidemics change society, agrees. \u201cIt seems to me essential, desirable and good economics, politics and morals to go about stimulating the economy in ways that are sustainable in the long term; a green economy,\u201d he said. \u201cThat would protect our planet and protect our health \u2014 and put people back to work.\u201d\n\nWho needs experts?

It had previously been piloting deliveries in three areas in and around Mumbai.\n\nThe move comes just days after Jio \u2014 a part of Ambani's sprawling conglomerate Reliance Industries \u2014 secured more cash to fuel the billionaire's tech ambitions. The company has raised more than $10 billion in recent weeks, including a $5.7 billion investment fromwhich includes a tie-up between JioMart and WhatsApp. That deal is still undergoing regulatory approval.\n\nJioMart's expansion also comes as millions of Indians remain under lockdown because of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n\"Never waste a crisis, they say!\" Damodar Mall, chief executive of grocery retail at Reliance Retail, tweeted Saturday. Mall added that Chinese e-commerce giant\"flourished\" during the 2003 SARS pandemic, something founder and chairman Jack Ma has acknowledged\n\nAmazon AMZN Walmart-owned WMT andFlipKart are the two dominant e-commerce platforms in India. Both companies operate in hundreds of cities across the country, delivering goods such as smartphones, electronics and clothing.\n\nBut JioMart's launch \"is a reason for worry for Amazon and Flipkart, [because they] are not very strong in grocery,\" said Satish Meena, analyst with research firm Forrester. Both companies launched online grocery deliveries last year.\n\nAmazon and FlipKart have also faced difficulty delivering orders across India during the Covid-19 pandemic because of varying levels of restrictions from one city to the next, he said.\n\nFlipKart had to temporarily suspend services in March when the nationwide lockdown began, and Amazon had to to limit orders as it responded to increased demand.\n\nAmazon and FlipKart did not immediately respond to requests for comment. They are both currently delivering essential goods in India.\n\nJio's online grocery platform expanded services to 200 Indian cities, as large swathes of the country remains under lockdown because of Covid-19.\n\nJioMart launched late last year, with the goal of getting 30 million kiranas, small neighborhood mom and pop shops, online.\n\nGrocery is 70% of the Indian retail market, and more than 90% of the market is unorganized and driven by kirana stores, according to investment research firm Bernstein. The overall retail market is expected to double in size from $676 billion in 2018 to nearly $1.3 trillion by 2025, according to Bernstein.\n\nIndia's online grocery market is small by comparison, worth around $3 billion this year, according to Forrester. But the firm said that number is growing fast, as the pandemic is quickly changing people's shopping habits.\n\nBernstein and Forrester analysts say JioMart is well placed to disrupt the online grocery market because it can source supplies from Reliance's brick-and-mortar stores. Reliance is India's largest retail operator.

You can sign up right here\n\nLondon (CNN Business) Since the Great Recession following the 2008 financial crisis, China and India have powered much of the world's economic growth. Now, activity in both countries has plunged, raising the risk of a prolonged global slump.\n\nWhat's happening: China said Friday that it could not set a target for economic growth this year \u2014 a sign of how much uncertainty the coronavirus pandemic has caused the world's second largest economy.\n\nChina has set such targets for decades. Last year, Beijing targeted growth in the range of 6% to 6.5%. GDP grew 6.1%, its slowest pace in nearly 30 years.\n\nMeanwhile, Shaktikanta Das, the governor of the Reserve Bank of India, said Friday that the country's economy wouldn't grow at all in the current fiscal year, which ends in March 2021. The last time India's economy shrank over the course of a year was in 1979.\n\nThese announcements cast further doubt on the ability of the global economy to recover from its deepest downturn since the Great Depression.\n\nBank of America continues to slash its economic forecasts, it told clients Friday. The bank now predicts that the global economy will shrink by 4.2% this year, down from a 2.7% contraction it forecast six weeks ago. The IMF predicted in April that global output would contract by 3% in 2020.\n\nThe deteriorating relationship between the United States and China is giving investors even more reason to worry.\n\nEye on Hong Kong: Global stocks tumbled Friday after news broke that Beijing would pass a controversial national security law , the biggest blow to the city's autonomy since its handover to China in 1997. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index notched its worst performance since July 2015.\n\nThe US State Department has condemned the move, warning that \"any effort to impose national security legislation that does not reflect the will of the people of Hong Kong\" would be met with an international response.\n\nTensions had already been running high, with Beijing and Washington trading criticism over the handling of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nWatch this space: Chinese stocks have become a flashpoint . On Wednesday, the US Senate unanimously passed a bill that would prevent companies that refuse to open their books from listing on Wall Street. The bill's bipartisan cosponsors said the goal is to \"kick deceitful Chinese companies off US exchanges.\"\n\nCoronavirus could end Silicon Valley as we know it\n\nThe Silicon Valley of the past decade may be on its way out as remote work becomes the new normal.\n\nFirst came Twitter's pronouncement earlier this month that some employees would be able to continue working from home \"forever.\"\n\nThe company said the experience of working from home during the pandemic has shown that it can be adopted at scale.\n\n\"If our employees are in a role and situation that enables them to work from home and they want to continue to do so forever, we will make that happen,\" Twitter's vice president of people, Jennifer Christie, in a statement to CNN Business. \"If not, our offices will be their warm and welcoming selves, with some additional precautions, when we feel it's safe to return.\"\n\nFacebook FB CEO Mark Zuckerberg said Thursday that as many as 50% of employees could be working remotely within the next five to 10 years.\n\nZuckerberg pitched the idea as both a matter of keeping employees happy and creating \"more broad-based economic prosperity.\"\n\n\"When you limit hiring to people who live in a small number of big cities, or who are willing to move there, that cuts out a lot of people who live in different communities, have different backgrounds, have different perspectives,\" Zuckerberg said on a livestream.\n\nWhat it means: US tech companies have fared far better than most firms during the pandemic. Demand for cloud services has shot up, and employees were already used to working from home. Now tech leaders may reconsider all the money they spend maintaining their high-end campuses, which had been a key perk for employees \u2014 and a symbol of Silicon Valley's prosperity.\n\nRemember Brexit? Why the UK recession could be really bad\n\nAs nations around the world attempt to dig their way out of a cataclysmic global recession, Britain is in a particularly tight spot of its own making.\n\nThe country is in the middle of an economic disaster and a health crisis. The Bank of England has predicted that the United Kingdom is heading for its worst economic crash in more than 300 years, while its death toll from Covid-19 is the highest in Europe.\n\nYet the United Kingdom is also racing toward a self-imposed deadline to construct a post-Brexit trade agreement with the European Union, its single biggest market for exports, by the end of the year. Talks are not going well \u2014 raising the possibility of another major shock just as the expected economic recovery gains momentum.\n\n\"The whole of the advanced world is in recession because of the coronavirus,\" Kallum Pickering, senior economist at Berenberg Bank, told me. \"But the UK has an additional problem of the UK-EU negotiations in the second half of the year.\"\n\nConcerns about Brexit could weigh on household spending, which accounts for around 70% of GDP in the UK, Pickering said. That could limit the impact of government relief efforts.\n\nThis just in: Attempting to stem the vast economic damage, the UK government borrowed \u00a362.1 billion ($75.7 billion) in April, the highest level since records began in 1993.", "link": "https://us.cnn.com/2020/05/22/investing/premarket-stocks-trading/index.html", "published": "2020-05-22T00:00:00", "author": ["Julia Horowitz", "Cnn Business"]}, {"title": "India's economy will shrink this year for the first time since 1979", "text": "New Delhi/Hong Kong (CNN Business) India's economy won't grow at all this year, despite an anticipated rebound in activity in the coming months, the head of the country's central bank said Friday.\n\nShaktikanta Das, the governor of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), said that GDP in Asia's third biggest economy would fall for the fiscal year of 2020-2021, which ends next March. The last time India's economy shrank over the course of a year was in 1979.\n\nDas made the projection while announcing a slew of new measures to prop up the ailing economy , which has largely been shut down due to a nationwide lockdown over the coronavirus pandemic\n\nHe announced that the RBI would slash its lending rate from 4.4% to 4%.

Air pollution already kills 7 million of us every year, damages our children's health and development, causes serious breathing and lung problems, and even affects babies in the womb.\n\nNow climate experts are demanding countries use this recovery period to enact policies that reduce emissions and invest in renewable energy and climate-resilient infrastructure. That, they say, will create jobs, be better for the economy in the long term and, crucially, save lives.\n\nBailing out fossil fuel companies and funding high-carbon industries, by contrast, will set back the planet's chances of limiting global temperatures to within levels needed to stave off the worst of the climate catastrophe\n\nFor Pulitzer Prize-winner Joseph Stiglitz, and a group of leading economists, this is a make or break moment.\n\n\"The recovery packages can either kill these two birds with one stone \u2014 setting the global economy on a pathway towards net-zero emissions \u2014 or lock us into a fossil system from which it will be nearly impossible to escape,\" they wrote earlier this month in the Oxford Review of Economic Policy.\n\nBuilding green, climate resilient infrastructure\n\nBefore the virus hit, India had clear targets on climate change.\n\nIt had committed to having 40% of its power generation supplied by non-fossil fuels by 2030, and had increased its target for renewable energy capacity to 450 gigawatts by then, too.\n\nDemand for coal \u2014 which generates about 75% of India's electricity \u2014 was down , as renewable energy became much cheaper, and on the world stage India had taken a lead in climate negotiations.\n\n\"Before pandemic hit the predictions were that India would surpass its targets,\" said Aparna Roy, associate fellow and co-lead on climate change and energy at the Centre for New Economic Diplomacy (CNED).\n\nBut the coronavirus lockdowns have wreaked huge economic disruption on India's economy. More than 120 million people lost their jobs in April, mostly informal laborers and small traders, according to the Centre for Monitoring the Indian Economy (CMIE).\n\nTo ease the economic pain, the Indian government last week unveiled $266 billion economic package aimed at building a \"self-reliant India,\" according to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and will help micro, small and medium-sized enterprises.\n\nThe details of that package are still being rolled out, but government support for energy efficiency upgrades for businesses and targets for decarbonizing as conditions on funds could go a long way, experts say.\n\n\"Fossil fuel industries, facing extraordinarily low oil prices, are likely to request future tax breaks or bailouts,\" the economists write in the Oxford University study. \"While there may be good reasons for such support, such bailouts should be conditional on these industries developing a measurable plan of action to transition towards a net-zero emissions future.\"\n\nover seven times larger than those for alternative energy, according to from two environmental think tanks found in April, highlighting an area where India has to do better. Subsidies for fossil fuels in India were alreadyover seven times larger than those for alternative energy, according to a report from two environmental think tanks found in April, highlighting an area where India has to do better.\n\nThe disruption from the virus could also impact whether India meets its renewable energy targets.\n\nThe country wants to be a leader in solar power and is aiming for 175 gigawatts of renewable energy by 2022, with the majority of that to come from solar. But construction on solar projects was halted during lockdown as the majority of the components needed for these installations come from China, where factories shut during the pandemic.\n\nIndia also depends on international finance to help reach its climate goals \u2014 a pot that could dry up as developed nations struggle with their own economic hardships.\n\n\"Most developed countries that are already regressing from their commitments, this is an opportunity to not commit the further finance that is urgently required for developing countries to make their transition,\" Roy said.\n\nJUST WATCHED Lockdowns lead to air pollution drops in major cities Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Lockdowns lead to air pollution drops in major cities 01:08\n\nIndia's development depends on green policies\n\nIndia's long-term coronavirus recovery strategy could also determine how the country progresses not only with its clean energy transition but the health and development of its people.\n\nIndia's ability to provide enough food and energy for its growing population hinges on building infrastructure that will withstand the impacts from the climate crisis, having a sustainable agriculture sector, and transitioning to renewable energy.\n\n\"The Covid pandemic has actually highlighted how important three things are: food security; sustainable, reliable and affordable energy access; and the third is critical infrastructure,\" Roy said. \"Poverty alleviation will require India to have energy and food security, at the same time its energy and food security are very vulnerable to climate impact.\"\n\nThose climate impacts are already being felt. Deadly heatwaves with temperatures above 50 degrees Celsius (122 Fahrenheit) are now the norm during summer. Erratic monsoon rains bring annual flooding that grind entire cities to a standstill, and disrupt the region's vital crop production. Pollution from factories, exhausts and crop burning choke India's cities every year, damaging the health of millions.\n\nAdding to the urgency is that this nation of 1.3 billion people is the world's third-largest emitter of carbon dioxide. And those energy needs are expected to double over the next decade due to its rapidly growing population and economy.\n\nConstruction of roads, buildings and other infrastructure such as transport links will need to expand to keep up with the millions of people moving to cities.\n\nAnd millions more still have no or poor access to electricity and use polluting fuels such as wood or kerosene for cooking and lighting. The challenge over the next decade will be how to rapidly expand energy access, and sustainably develop the agriculture sector \u2014 which hundreds of millions of people in India depend on for their livelihoods \u2014 while not increasing emissions and pollution.\n\nHaving a coronavirus recovery strategy that builds green infrastructure, reduces emissions and ramps up renewable energy capacity and production is therefore a huge opportunity for India.\n\n\"How India meets its development trajectory and meets the energy transition is very important. India has the opportunity to create the kind of a model that it can export to other developing nations,\" Roy said.\n\nCoal is a crucial area for China after Covid\n\nBefore the pandemic, China was on track to achieve most of its climate commitments \u2014 which included a peak in carbon emissions by 2030, and a 20% share of renewable energy in its primary energy demand. It had also made big strides in reducing pollution in its cities, with Beijing now out of the world's top 100 most polluted.\n\nthe world's largest developer of renewable energy, and dramatically In recent years, China had becomethe world's largest developer of renewable energy, and dramatically reduced the price of solar power.\n\nBut Covid-19 has shrunk China's economy into its worst three-month period in decades. Some 80 million Chinese may already be out of work and experts say it will be a long road to recovery.\n\n\"There will be major pressures in China to stimulate the economy and keep people employed, and China's coal industry still a huge employer,\" said Joanna Lewis, associate professor of energy and environment and an expert on China's clean energy at Georgetown University.\n\nChina is the world's largest producer and consumer of coal and there is evidence that China is relaxing restrictions around fossil fuel, signaling a possible move to use coal to boost the country's coronavirus-hit economy.\n\nIn the first few weeks of March, more coal-fired capacity was permitted for construction in China than in all of 2019, according to the Global Energy Monitor\n\nConstruction of plants could give an economic boost in the short term. But in the long-term coal is generally unprofitable \u2014 research by Carbon Tracker found that 40% of China's coal plants are losing money.\n\n\"Even if renewables are technically cheaper at this point, they will have to complete against a coal industry being supported by government programs to reduce output, push up prices and guarantee output contracts,\" Lewis said.\n\nIt may talk a green talk, but carbon emissions have been rising in China over the past few years as its economy slowed.\n\n\"Even before the outbreak we saw backsliding in commitments to slow coal growth, with increasing demand in 2019 after years of slowing growth,\" said Lewis.\n\nEyes will be on China's biggest annual political meeting, the National People's Congress (NPC), which kicks off on May 22 after being delayed because of the virus. The sessions unveil key economic targets and budgets \u2014 and measures to revive the economy after coronavirus will be center stage.\n\nObservers will be keen to see how much climate policy will be on the agenda.\n\nLewis said a green economic package would be a \"huge opportunity to capitalize on the last decade of progress it has made in pushing forward clean energy innovation and deployment and ensure the low carbon transition can continue.\"\n\nImportantly, China is drafting its 14th Five Year Plan \u2014 a roadmap of the country's goals and a key indicator of how much clean energy and sustainable development will be a focus in the next five years. Because China is the world's biggest polluter, the document's climate policy is hugely important.\n\n\"The technologies China should be investing in are different from where they invested a decade ago,\" Lewis said. \"Rather than investing in wind power technology, for example, more investment in battery technology would not only enable further deployment of EVs (electric vehicles) but can help to balance a grid that is relying on more and more renewable energy.\"\n\nChina leads the world in deployment of electric vehicles. At the end of June 2019, 45% of the electric cars and almost all electric buses were in China.\n\nreport by China Briefing said the country's recovery strategy will likely push it toward a \"sustainable and technology-driven economic model\" with investments in \"new infrastructure\" such as big data centers, 5G, and charging stations for new energy vehicles.\n\nAt the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP 26) \u2014 postponed until next year because of the virus \u2014 China and India are expected to update their climate commitments, along with other countries. What they do during this recovery time will have ramifications for global climate action.\n\nLewis said coordination between China and the United States \u2014 the world's second-biggest polluter \u2014 should be a \"crucial element of US-China engagement going forward.\"\n\nWithout it, she said: \"We risk valuable global action being taken during this next decade, which is no doubt the decisive decade for climate change.\"", "link": "https://us.cnn.com/2020/05/20/business/coronavirus-recovery-climate-india-china-intl-hnk/index.html", "published": "2020-05-20T00:00:00", "author": ["Helen Regan", "Cnn Business"]}, {"title": "Cyclone Amphan caused an estimated $13.2 billion in damage in India's West Bengal: government source", "text": "Kolkata, India (CNN) The powerful cyclone that slammed into the coastal region where India and Bangladesh meet Wednesday likely caused $13.2 billion dollars in West Bengal alone, according to a source in the Indian state's government.\n\nThe storm, Cyclone Amphan, packed powerful winds and heavy rains that killed at least 80 people in West Bengal and another 10 across the border in Bangladesh.

The virus, which continues to spread through both countries, has complicated the emergency response, as relief teams grapple with how to get people to safety while also protecting them against the risk of Covid-19.\n\nIndia passed more than 100,000 confirmed infections earlier this week, according to Johns Hopkins University, and recorded its largest single-day spike on Wednesday with 5,611 new cases.

What's next?\n\nA: \"Two months ago, recovery wasn't on anyone's mind,\" said \"Two months ago, recovery wasn't on anyone's mind,\" said Dr. Reynold Panettieri , a pulmonary critical care physician in New Jersey. While most patients with coronavirus will fully recover, data from China suggest that some patients, especially those who had more severe infections, may face lasting \u2014 even permanent \u2014 damage to their bodies. To better understand these effects, Panettieri is leading a six-month study of recovered Covid-19 patients. Unlike most viral diseases, which may result in a nagging cough for weeks, Panettieri has observed that some patients have other serious symptoms that won't go away. He said this could be related to a number of factors, including how the virus affects the lungs, heart and muscles. So far, it seems overcoming the disease is only the first step in a much longer journey.\n\nSend your questions here . Are you a health care worker fighting Covid-19?

By contrast, antibody tests use blood samples to look for biological signals that a person has been exposed to the virus in the past.\n\nCombining the two types of tests overstates a state's testing ability, a crucial metric as nearly all states ease the coronavirus restrictions. Experts have consistently emphasized that for states to reopen, there has to be adequate testing and tracing.\n\nDisasters complicate coronavirus\n\nCatastrophic flooding in Michigan and a powerful cyclone that slammed India and Bangladesh have shown the challenges of responding to natural disasters amid the pandemic.\n\nWhen a rain-swollen river breached two dams in central Michigan it sent at least 10,000 people fleeing from their homes.

Its cloud field is 2,800 kilometers (1,740 miles) long from tip to tail -- that's the equivalent of the distance from Lisbon to Warsaw.\n\nThere's also a risk of powerful storm surges of up to 5 meters (16.4 feet), that could inundate low-lying coastal areas and be catastrophic for millions of people. In the areas under threat from the cyclone many villagers live in temporary homes with thatched or tin roofs.\n\nHeavy rain is also likely to lead to flash flooding across the region through Thursday morning. The storm is expected to weaken significantly as it continues to push inland across eastern India and Bangladesh and dissipate by Friday.\n\nUp to 33.6 million people in India could be exposed to the storm's powerful winds, according to the US Pacific Disaster Center (PDC). In Bangladesh, 8 million could be in its path, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) said.\n\nOn Wednesday, Bangladesh raised its cyclone warning for the port towns of Mongla and Payra, which are in the storm's path, and 11 districts to danger signal 10 -- its second highest alert level. Meanwhile, the Indian Coast Guard has deployed 20 disaster relief teams along the country's eastern coast to carry out search and rescue operations at short notice, a spokesperson for India's Ministry of Defence said on Twitter.\n\nSince Amphan is a large storm and spent multiple days at the equivalent of a Category 3 to 5 strength, the surge will be more significant than that of a typical Category 2 storm when it hits, meteorologists predict. The U-shape of the coastline around the Bay of Bengal and the low-lying delta region make the area prone to storm surge flooding.\n\nBefore it weakened on Wednesday, Amphan became just the second super cyclone to hit the Bay of Bengal since records began. During the last super cyclone in 1999, nearly 15,000 villages were affected and almost 10,000 people were killed.\n\nMass evacuations underway\n\nRelief teams are rushing to evacuate people in low-lying coastal areas in both India and Bangladesh.\n\nBy Wednesday, Bangladesh had evacuated 2.4 million people, according to Enamur Rahaman, the State Minister for Disaster Management and Relief, who said evacuees from coastal areas would be relocated more than 12,000 cyclone shelters.\n\nThe Bangladesh Disaster Management Ministry said there is capacity nationwide for 9.1 million people to be safety housed in cyclone shelters while maintaining social distancing, as thousands of schools and government buildings are used for this purpose.\n\n\"(The government has) increased the evacuation shelter capacity, so that people can be taken to these shelters and ensure the physical distance,\" said Achala Navaratne, spokesperson for the American Red Cross in Bangladesh.\n\nA volunteer urges residents to evacuate to shelters ahead of the expected landfall of the cyclone in Khulna, Bangladesh, on May 19.\n\n\"They have also asked people to come with their own masks, make sure that if there are people that are showing any symptoms then to make sure they are in different shelters, not in the same shelters as the others.\"\n\nIn India, by Wednesday morning, more than 430,000 people had been evacuated in the states of Odisha and West Bengal states, according to India's National Disaster Relief Force (NDRF). In West Bengal cyclone shelters can normally house 500,000 people, according to the NDRF, but because of social distancing rules, that number had been reduced by more than half to just 200,000.\n\nFishermen have been warned to remain onshore and not sail out for the next 24 hours by the Indian Meteorological Department.\n\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi reviewed the country's emergency response measures on Monday night, ahead of the storm's landfall in India. After the meeting, Modi said on his official Twitter account that evacuation plans had been discussed, as well as other emergency response measures.\n\n\"I pray for everyone's safety and assure all possible support from the Central Government,\" he said.\n\nCoronavirus pandemic\n\nThe storm comes as India and Bangladesh struggle to bring local coronavirus outbreaks under control. India passed more than 100,000 confirmed infections on Monday, according to Johns Hopkins University, and recorded its largest single-day spike on Wednesday with 5,611 new cases.\n\nMeanwhile, Bangladesh's infection count is rapidly rising, with more than 1,300 new cases on Sunday, its biggest rise to date. In total, the country has recorded 23,870 confirmed infections, according to Johns Hopkins.\n\nThe countries will face as a double challenge, as emergency workers have to carry out difficult work with masks, gloves and visors, evacuating people who may already have the virus.\n\nPradeep Jena, special relief commissioner for Odisha state, said emergency services had to balance saving lives from the cyclone with saving lives from the coronavirus. \"We have to strike a balance between the two and evacuate people wherever it is extremely essential, otherwise people are better off in their own homes,\" he said.\n\nJena said in evacuation centers, they were trying to keep the elderly and pregnant women separate from the rest of the population and were working hard to obtain adequate soap.\n\n\"Social distancing is definitely a very good concept but enforcing it in the strictest possible manner in a disaster situation may not always be possible,\" he said.\n\nMembers of India's National Disaster Response Force warn people on the Bay of Bengal coast at Namkhana, West Bengal, on May 19\n\nSnigdha Chakraborty, the Bangladesh manager for aid organization Catholic Relief Services, said people in the storm's path are worried about how they can ride it out while practicing social distancing.\n\n\"They're stressed. They are worried about going to evacuation centers. And they are also worried about maintaining physical distance,\" she said.\n\nThe problem is particularly acute in Cox's Bazar, which is home to nearly 1 million Rohingya refugees, many who fled violence in neighboring Myanmar.\n\nThe first known Covid-19 cases were confirmed in the camp last week and with the storm now imminent, the two disasters could make for a devastating combination.\n\nThough Cox's Bazar is on Bangladesh's east coast and further from the storm, Chakraborty said the camp could be affected.\n\nBangladesh's state minister for disaster management and relief Md. Enamur Rahman said evacuating the camp, was \"not that important\" as the warning signal for the area was at 6, a relatively manageable level.\n\n\"Evacuation is still not that important and [there] are many cyclone center[s] around the Rohingya camps[,] so if the direction of cyclone changes toward Cox's Bazar and Chittagong then they would be evacuated,\" he said on Wednesday.\n\nOne human rights advocate said that a novel coronavirus outbreak in the camp would be a \"nightmare scenario.\"\n\n\"The prevalence of underlying health conditions among refugees and the deteriorating sanitary conditions sure to come with the looming monsoon and flooding season make for a witch's brew of conditions in which the virus is sure to thrive,\" said Daniel P.

And if he plays his cards right, his mobile carrier and technology juggernaut Jio Platforms could soon hold rank alongside the likes of Google ( GOOGL ), Amazon ( AMZN ), Alibaba ( BABA ) and Tencent ( TCEHY ).\n\nJio Platforms already has an ecosystem of apps \u2014 which feature everything from online grocery shopping to video streaming \u2014 that it serves to the 388 million people subscribed through the Reliance Jio mobile network in India.\n\nNow, Asia's richest man is getting even more ambitious. In the span of a few weeks, he's amassed a $9 billion war chest fromand a clutch of A-list American investors to fuel the next phase of his domination of India's internet, the fastest growing in the world.\n\nAmbani \"definitely [wants Jio Platforms] to be more than just a telecom company. They want to be the next Google or Tencent of India,\" said Wylie Fernyhough, an analyst with PitchBook.\n\nThe \"ultimate goal,\" according to Counterpoint Research analyst Tarun Pathak, is to become everything to every Indian and build an indispensable platform for the country's hundreds of millions of internet customers.\n\nBillionaire Mukesh Ambani wants JioPlatforms to be a place where Indians can do everything from mobile banking, to messaging, to social media.\n\nBuilding a new kind of tech giant\n\nUnder Ambani's leadership, Reliance Industries has grown from an oil and energy company into a sprawling conglomerate that includes retail shops, a mobile and broadband carrier, digital platforms and more.\n\nBut to take his plans to the next level, Ambani needed buy-in from Silicon Valley \u2014 hence, his $5.7 billion partnership with Facebook and its global messaging service WhatsApp. When the deal was announced last month, the scale of his ambition was clear.\n\n\"This winning recipe will be extended to serve other key stakeholders of Indian society,\" Ambani said. \"Our kisans [small agricultural workers]. Our small and medium enterprises. Our students and teachers. Our healthcare providers.\"\n\nThe deal, which is still awaiting regulatory approval, signaled that Ambani and Facebook are trying to create \"some sort of platform where you can do everything from mobile banking, to messaging, to your social media, to everything basically built into just one platform,\" according to Fernyhough. In other words, a version of Tencent's wildly popular WeChat service in China.\n\nUnlike Tencent, though, Jio Platforms also has a massive mobile network that it can rely on to build a base of customers.\n\n\"We have seen the e-commerce, content, cloud, tech companies replacing traditional telcos,\" said Pathak.\n\nRakuten RKUNF AT&T T He pointed toJapan, an e-commerce company that is now working to build a 5G network, and to US mobile carriers, who are becoming \"content houses\" as the number of cord cutting Americans grows. (CNN is owned by.)\n\n\"Eventually you can't just sell data, right, it will be much more on top of it,\" he said.\n\nFacebook has pushed back on the idea that it is helping Ambani build a \"super app\" by noting that the two companies will continue to operate separately in India with their own services.\n\nUnder Ambani's leadership, Reliance Industries has grown from an oil company into a sprawling conglomerate that includes retail shops, a mobile carrier, digital platforms and more.\n\nInstead, the two companies are providing \"enabling blocks for small businesses to come online, that then allows many other companies to ride on that,\" Ajit Mohan, vice president and managing director of Facebook for India, told CNN Business.\n\nBut even that level of collaboration gives Ambani a great deal of clout in India, allowing him to find new customers by offering online services and digital tools that Indians are clamoring for.\n\nGrocery as a step toward domination\n\nOnline grocery shopping is the partnership's first target. Grocery is 70% of the Indian retail market, according to Bernstein, and more than 90% of the market is unorganized and driven by small neighborhood mom and pop shops, known as kirana stores in India. The overall retail market is expected to double in size from $676 billion in 2018 to nearly $1.3 trillion by 2025, according to Bernstein.\n\nIndia's online grocery market is small by comparison, worth around $3 billion this year, according to the research firm Forrester. But the firm said that number is growing fast, as the pandemic is quickly changing people's shopping habits.\n\nWhen JioMart launched late last year, it set a goal of convincing 30 million small shops to do business on the platform.\n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic and the accompanying lockdown in India have accelerated the need to get kiranas online fast. WhatsApp will be instrumental in making that happen, because more than 400 million Indians already use it as their main messaging app, and often text businesses directly to buy goods or ask about products and services.\n\nAmazon AMZN Walmart-owned WMT JioMart and WhatsApp are \"going to make life complicated forand () FlipKart. Because this lockdown has proven one thing: That Amazon and FlipKart are not equipped to deliver groceries in India in their current format,\" said Satish Meena, an analyst with Forrester.\n\nThat was the experience of Sambit Mohanty, a 40-year-old sales and marketing executive.\n\nWorried about his elderly parents, Mohanty ordered basic essentials like tea leaves and soup for them on Amazon. But delivery took 10 days. He was also unable to buy toys for his daughter on Amazon, because it stopped taking orders for non-essential items.\n\nNow Mohanty said he's turning back to local grocers \u2014 many of which do business on WhatsApp.\n\n\"It only takes a notice from the government, and Amazon ... puts a [notice] online saying that they won't deliver,\" he said. \"But the local kirana stores are always available.\"\n\nThere are some disadvantages to relying on those shops: Kiranas can have trouble keeping track of stock, since many owners record their inventory by writing items down in a book and crossing stuff off when it gets sold.\n\nIf JioMart can sign up the millions of kiranas it wants, while also organizing them and helping them keep track of their inventory, that could be a game changer. Reliance also has the largest number of brick-and-mortar grocery stores in India, which could act as partner suppliers.\n\nPathak, of Counterpoint Research, said it will be easier to convince the mom and pop shops to join JioMart because WhatsApp is involved, so they won't have to download and learn how to use another app.\n\nGood for Ambani's bottom line\n\nThe recent fundraising spree is about more than fueling India's digital growth. Ambani also needs money to pay off Reliance Industries' ballooning debt.\n\nShortly after the Facebook deal was announced, Jio Platforms revealed three more big investments: $750 million from Silver Lake, $1.5 billion from Vista and $870 million from General Atlantic.\n\nIn all, Ambani secured about $9 billion in less than four weeks. Analysts say Ambani is under pressure to pay off debt, offset the massive declines he is experiencing in oil and other sectors, and prove the value of Jio Platforms.\n\nThe billionaire said at a shareholders meeting last year that he wants Reliance Industries to become a \"zero net debt company\" by March 2021. As of March 2020, Reliance had about $44 billion of debt on its books.\n\n\"Reliance also needs technology to shift from a petroleum and trading company to [a] software company,\" said Meena, of Forrester. The pandemic has badly dented the oil business.

As crowds gathered in the Causeway Bay shopping district, they were met by an exceptionally large police presence and warnings that any protest would be in violation of both the city's public order laws and coronavirus social distancing measures.\n\nHong Kong police were roundly criticized over their heavy-handed tactics last year, including most recently by a former member of a government-sponsored panel looking into the protests. On Sunday it was not just the force police used -- tear gas, baton charges, and water cannon against unarmed, mostly peaceful protesters -- but also the speed at which they deployed it. The first round of tear gas was fired within 25 minutes of the proposed start time for the march.\n\nBy comparison, several unauthorized marches last year -- in which hundreds of thousands of people protested a proposed extradition bill with China, eventually succeeding in forcing the government to shelve it -- were only broken-up after clashes between protesters and police, often many hours after first getting underway.\n\nMillions of people took part in the protests last year, which changed the city's character forever and created a yawning political divide that has only grown larger since. Hong Kong now seems set for another summer of unrest, with the key anniversaries of the Tiananmen Massacre and the city's handover to Chinese rule on the horizon.\n\nThe coronavirus caused a pause in the unrest at the beginning of this year, but as the danger passes in Hong Kong, people are more willing to come out. At the same time, however, the police are better equipped and more prepared, and the local authorities seem determined to wipe out any dissent before it gets off the ground.\n\nPolice tell pro-democracy protesters gathered in Causeway Bay district of Hong Kong to leave on May 24, 2020, ahead of planned protests against a proposal to enact new security legislation in Hong Kong.\n\nLooking for hope\n\nWriting in response to the proposed anti-sedition bill, Nathan Law, a former pro-democracy lawmaker, urged Hong Kongers not to be disheartened, pointing out that they had achieved \"miracles\" in the past.\n\nBut short of divine intervention, it's hard to see how anyone in the city can block the bill. On Wednesday, legislators will resume debate on another law demanded by China, making it a crime punishable by imprisonment to insult the country's national anthem. That bill has taken over three years to pass, thanks to repeated filibustering and delaying tactics, and protesters plan to encircle the legislature in an attempt to delay it even further.\n\nNeither tactic can be used against the anti-sedition bill, which will be debated and imposed by Beijing's parliament, not Hong Kong's, and will come into force regardless of what happens in the city in the coming weeks. Pro-Beijing lawmakers and bodies in the city have already lined up to support the bill, while Hong Kong's police commissioner said Monday the new law will \"help combat the force of 'Hong Kong independence' and restore social order.\"\n\nWith its options limited, the city's opposition is looking to the international community to pressure Beijing into changing course.\n\nReaction to the proposed law has been damning. More than 200 parliamentarians and and policymakers from two dozen countries signed an open letter last week slamming the anti-sedition bill as a \"comprehensive assault on the city's autonomy, rule of law, and fundamental freedoms.\"\n\nSignatories included Chris Patten, the last British colonial governor of Hong Kong, six US senators including Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, and numerous UK, European Union, Australian and New Zealand members of parliament.\n\nLater this month, the US Congress is due to decide whether Hong Kong remains sufficiently autonomous from mainland China to justify continuing its special trading privileges . Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the proposed anti-sedition bill would \"inevitably impact our assessment,\" and other lawmakers have suggested imposing sanctions against Beijing and Hong Kong officials responsible for the move.\n\nJUST WATCHED Hong Kong lawmaker: Our young are fighting for their future Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Hong Kong lawmaker: Our young are fighting for their future 03:19\n\nPressure campaign\n\nHistorically, China does not respond well to international pressure. Indeed, part of the stated-motivation for the anti-sedition bill is Beijing's paranoia that Hong Kong has become a base for anti-regime activity fostered by malicious foreign powers.\n\nBy this logic, the denouncement of its moves by those same governments may only strengthen China's resolve and play into the narrative that overseas actors are behind the unrest.\n\nNor does the threat of sanctions or international condemnation have a strong track record in recent history. Sanctions can cause misery and death for ordinary people -- cut off from vital supplies and hurt by the economy -- but they often do not shake those they are designed to punish.\n\nNorth Korea has defied decades of being a global pariah and crippling economic punishment to pursue its nuclear program, while sanctions imposed on Vladimir Putin's Russia did not stop him from seizing Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. China is far, far more secure economically and militarily than either country, and can draw on strong alliances elsewhere in the world to balance any aggression from the US.\n\n\"The US does have tangible options in its toolkit to exert pressure on China. But after the two-year long trade war, China has encountered all possible US punitive tools and has built its resilience,\" the nationalistic state-backed tabloid Global Times said in an editorial Friday . \"China's latest announcement showed its strategic contempt for Washington's tactics of pressuring Beijing. As long as the US dares to play its cards, China will play the game without hesitation.\"\n\nRiot police stand guard during an anti-government rally on May 24, 2020 in Hong Kong.\n\nNo way out?\n\nProtests against the anti-sedition bill will continue in Hong Kong, at least for now. Multiple demonstrations have already been planned or called for -- though it remains to be seen how many will be willing to come out when police have shown a willingness to crack down hard and early.\n\nCommemoration of the Tiananmen Square massacre is also due to go ahead on June 4, despite continued coronavirus restrictions preventing a mass rally being held for the first time in over two-decades.\n\nOnce the law comes into force, and any criticism of the government potential \"subversion\" charge -- as many dissidents in China have learned only too well -- a major chilling effect can be expected. There may also be a further radicalizing of those already prepared to use violence, particularly among separatists who might face arrest for past promotion of Hong Kong independence. The increased risk of injury, arrest and prison time as the protests escalated last year turned some away, but it did not stop the unrest, and there is no reason to think the new law will do so immediately either.\n\nBut the ability provided under the new law for Chinese state security agencies to operate in the city for the first time, could see many protesters swept up before they have a chance to take to the streets.\n\nAlready, some are talking about heading for the exits, a task made more difficult by the coronavirus pandemic, but not impossible. Last year, two protesters sought on riot charges were granted asylum in Germany , and pressure is already growing in the UK for Westminster to do something to protect its former colonial citizens.\n\nTaiwan, where sympathy protests were held in support of Hong Kong over the weekend, has long been a destination for those fleeing Communist rule in China. While the island does not currently have legal protections for refugees , on Sunday its president, Tsai Ing-wen, vowed to \"proactively improve and forge ahead with relevant support work, and provide Hong Kong's people with necessary assistance.\"\n\nA similar exodus was seen in the run up to 1997, when China first assumed control over Hong Kong. Ultimately, Beijing's hands-off approach and honoring of the city's existing freedoms helped convince many of those who had left to return. Now, as China's mood over its truculent special administrative region seems to have soured for good, they may be questioning that decision.", "link": "https://us.cnn.com/2020/05/25/asia/hong-kong-china-national-security-law-intl-hnk/index.html", "published": "2020-05-25T00:00:00", "author": ["Analysis James Griffiths"]}, {"title": "Hong Kong protest over proposed national security law met with tear gas", "text": "Hong Kong (CNN) Thousands of protesters took to the streets of Hong Kong Sunday to oppose the Chinese government's move to impose a controversial national security law, which threatens the city's autonomy and civil liberties.\n\nPolice fired tear gas at the crowds less than an hour after the start of the march, which did not receive official authorization and went against coronavirus social distancing restrictions, which ban groups of more than eight people meeting.

When we met up with other humans, it wasn't enough to simply be there with them; we felt an urge to instantly bond with them. And so we kissed, we hugged, we shook hands, we high-fived.\n\nThat was how things were until early 2020. Then came the age of coronavirus and the need for social distancing, self-isolation, quarantine, lockdown and shelter-in-place.\n\nToday, we humans continue to be social animals, and we continue to crave connection. We need to find a way to build an instant bond but we have to do it without physical contact. Research shows that a single handshake can transfer 124 million bacteria on average, so it is quite likely a perfect way to share viruses as well. A high-five will transfer about half of that number.\n\nSome of us have dusted the elbow bump off the shelf. This is what the World Health Organization told us to use in the 2006 age of avian flu.\n\nBut let's face it, elbow contact just doesn't have the same sizzle as, say, a handshake or a hug. You just have to see this picture of two grimacing presidential candidates to feel convinced about that.\n\nAnd Director-general of the World Health Organization Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus recently said it wasn't a good idea, tweeting \"When greeting people, best to avoid elbow bumps because they put you within 1 meter of the other person.\"\n\nSo some elder statesmen around the world are using the bonding method that they've learned during their state visits to India: Namaste.\n\nNamaste around the world\n\nIn case you haven't taken a yoga class, namaste is when you bring your hands together, palms pressed against each other, centered at your chest. Namaste is part of several yoga postures, but it is also the traditional way in which the people of India greet each other. And, since it involves no physical contact, it is virus-proof.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had traveled to India in 2018. So when coronavirus struck, he was one of the first to adopt namaste as his greeting of choice. He has also encouraged his country to abandon handshakes and adopt namaste -- and is giving free tutorials\n\nFrance's President Emmanuel Macron also recently decided to employ namaste in welcoming Spain's King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia. The French ambassador to India, Emmanuel Lenain, later tweeted , \"President Macron has decided to greet all his counterparts with a namaste, a graceful gesture that he has retained from his India visit in 2018.\"\n\nIn US President Donald Trump's recent state visit to India, his host, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, may not have been able to sell him on a new trade deal, but he did sell him on namaste. Soon after his return, Trump folded his hands to greet Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar.\n\n\"I just got back from India. And I did not shake any hands there, and it was very easy because they go like this and Japan goes like this,\" Trump said, demonstrating the Indian namaste and the Japanese bow. \"They are ahead of the curve.\"\n\nAfter a number of visits to India, England's Prince Charles too has now adopted namaste as his preferred style of greeting, although, as this video shows , old habits are hard to break.\n\nIt's high time namaste went global, for it has been around in India forever. Namaste may arguably be the oldest form of greeting in active use on our planet. Earthen figures excavated by archeologists from the Indus Valley Civilization, dating back to 3,000 BC, show people in the namaste pose.\n\nIn contrast, the handshake only originated, like, yesterday -- around the 9th century BC.\n\nYou can use it during your video conference\n\nBecause namaste involves no contact, it is also the perfect form of remote greeting. So tomorrow when you run what may be your 31st virtual meeting in this age of coronavirus, think about it. You can't shake your colleagues' hands or give them a hug as they enter the Zoom video conference room, but you can invite them all to build a bond with each other through a namaste. That's what we are doing now in our team meetings at Mentora Institute.\n\nBesides its no-contact benefits, there are other alluring possibilities in adopting namaste as your preferred greeting. A few years ago, as I was wrapping up a keynote to an audience of 600 executives, I felt a strong tug in my heart for the audience. They had listened to me for an hour, laughed and sighed at my stories, and, through their nods and note-taking, given a gracious reception to my ideas. I dearly wanted to hug each one of them at the end of my talk as they were applauding.\n\nIn 15 seconds, I was going to walk off stage and out of their lives forever, and I wanted to convey to each of them \"I am grateful for the beautiful connection you and I made today.\" How on Earth could I create this bond with 600 individuals before I rode away into the sunset?\n\nThen, instinctively, my hands folded and the palms pressed against each other, my thumbs close to my heart. Namaste. I realized that I was doing what I would do growing up in India every time I walked into a room buzzing with friends and family. Stand still. Bow ever so slightly. Smile. Sweep the room with one namaste while looking affectionately into everyone's eyes.\n\nNamaste has this powerful quality of being inclusive. With namaste, you are building an instant bond with all who are gathered in your midst -- not simply the one person right in front of you. It is physically impossible to achieve that with a kiss, a hug, a handshake, a high-five or an elbow bump, all of which are exclusively one-to-one. Namaste helps us to recognize that, like it or not, we are all connected; we rise and fall together. While we may choose to hug or bump elbows with just our favorites, when we offer a namaste, we are opening our heart to everyone, without discrimination. All of humanity is in our embrace.\n\nWhat does 'namaste' even mean?\n\nAnd that is not all. To understand namaste's ultimate potential as a social bonding tool, we need to ask, \"What does this strange-sounding word even mean?\"\n\nWithin the word Namaste is encoded the whole philosophy of yoga. Here's what I mean.\n\nIf I were to draw for you a line to represent the full spectrum of human nature, going from \"terrible\" to \"terrific,\" where would you place yourself on this line? Where would you place your favorite colleague? And your least favorite colleague?\n\nWherever you placed yourself, and wherever you placed these two colleagues, I offer that you are wrong. Because, you see, you are the whole spectrum, and so are they. Think of your worst quality, your worst behavior, your worst life moment. Now think of your best quality, your best behavior, your best life moment.\n\nYoga invites you to find that divine spark within yourself -- the part of you that I call your \"inner core\". When you operate from your inner core, you are centered, committed, connected and curious. You are able to step away from attachment, ego and insecurity to operate with wisdom and intention. You are at your full potential.\n\nThe more you discover this divine spark within your own self, the more you start seeing it all around you, in every throbbing heart, for it is innate in humanity. We all have it -- we just need to work on awakening it and expressing it in all we do.\n\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion's new newsletter. Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nNamaste is a Sanskrit word that means \"the divine spark in me bows to the divine spark in you.\" In other words, it is saying, on some days, you or I may be tired, ill-behaved or deeply flawed; but today, in this moment, as we connect, I seek to offer you the best in me, and I strive to draw out the best in you.\n\nIt is now abundantly clear that we will win the war with coronavirus only if we're all in this together. Rich have to unite with the poor, young with the old, conservatives with liberals, each nation with all others. We need to inspire not just the best in ourselves, but the best in others -- including the people who, on a more average day, we may dismiss, dislike or denounce.\n\nWhat better way to pursue this goal than to start and close every interaction by pressing palm against palm to gently affirm the untapped heroic potential that lies within everyone you engage with?\n\nBecause, as Gandhi once said, \"The difference between what we do and what we are capable of doing would suffice to solve most of the world's problems.\"\n\nNamaste.", "link": "https://us.cnn.com/2020/03/24/opinions/namaste-greeting-coronavirus-social-distancing-wadhwa/index.html", "published": "2020-03-24T00:00:00", "author": ["Opinion Hitendra Wadhwa"]}, {"title": "Democracy is dying in India, and Trump shouldn't be on Modi's side", "text": "Akanksha Singh is a journalist based in Mumbai, India.

View more opinion on CNN.\n\n(CNN) For decades following World War II, the free world has looked to the United States for democratic and civil guidance. So, when President Trump wrapped up his two-day visit to India in February and praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi for India's \"religious freedom\" following Hindu-Muslim riots in parts of the capital, it didn't just feel like Indian democracy was crumbling further; it felt as though it had got the go ahead from a global superpower.\n\n\"We did talk about religious freedom, and I will say that the prime minister was incredible on what he told me,\" Trump said while announcing a $3 billion trade deal with India at a press conference in New Delhi on February 25. \"[Modi] wants people to have religious freedom ... he said that in India they have worked very hard to have great and open religious freedom.\"\n\nIn reality, this religious freedom is under considerable threat, particularly for Muslims. The violence in New Delhi began over a disputed citizenship law on February 23, which led to clashes between Muslims and Hindus. The citizenship law, passed by the Indian government on December 11, 2019, grants fast-tracked citizenship to undocumented immigrants from Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Bangladesh based on their religion \u2014provided they aren't Muslim. Critics of this law see it as unconstitutional for purposely leaving out a religious group. India, the world's largest democracy \u2014 where 80% of the population is Hindu, compared with 14% Muslim \u2014 has been secular since its birth in 1947.\n\nSo far, 52 people have died and more than 500 have been injured. The riots have also been accompanied by arson, stone-pelting, and larceny. The last time the city saw religious violence on this scale was during anti-Sikh riots in 1984, which followed the assassination of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi by her Sikh bodyguards.\n\nThis recent violence isn't just an isolated incident. It's part of a disturbing trend in Modi's India. Since the Modi-led Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) came into power 2014, there has been a rise in violent crimes against minorities . The violence has followed a rise in overtly religious nationalism in India's politics; several members of the BJP advocate for \"Hindutva,\" a principle that aims to define Indian culture through Hindu values\n\nSo far, the US has declined to criticize the direction in which India is heading.\n\nAt his press conference in New Delhi, Trump declined to discuss the citizenship law, saying it was \"really up to India\" to handle. In describing Modi, Trump said he was a \"very religious man\" whom he admired and described India as \"an incredible country. It's got unbelievable energy.\"\n\nThis isn't the first time Trump has shown his support for Modi. Last year, Trump featured at the \"Howdy, Modi!\" event held on September 22 , in Houston, Texas, attended by an estimated 50,000, many of them Indian Americans.\n\nTrump's predecessor, President Barack Obama, also sought a warm relationship with Modi despite his record. Modi was, after all, the chief minister of the western state of Gujarat when Hindu-Muslim riots broke out under his watch in 2002. More than 1,000 people perished in those riots, most of whom were Muslim . The US State Department denied Modi a visa in 2005 over the issue. He has never apologized over what happened in Gujarat to date.\n\nGiven the divisive turn India has taken under Modi's leadership, Trump's support for Modi \u2014 offered, as it is, without much qualification and without any criticism \u2014 sends a dangerous signal that the US doesn't have any problems with his ethno-nationalist politics.\n\nThe New Delhi riots were \u2014 as some of my colleagues have pointed out \u2014 a pogrom. There is nothing to debate there, no matter what right-wing media mouthpieces in India say. Muslims were specifically singled out, their houses torched, their livelihoods destroyed, and their lives threatened \u2014 just like they had been, years before, when Modi was Gujarat's chief minister. Critics have leveled charges that police did not stop the violence, and the hatred for this minority has come from the uppermost levels of the BJP. \"Shoot the traitors\" has become a common cry at BJP rallies recently, after Anurag Thakur, the minister of state for finance, was seen leading a crowd with the inflammatory slogan in January. Unsurprisingly, perhaps, Modi did not condemn these comments either.\n\nThe only statement Modi made came nearly three days after the riots erupted in New Delhi \u2014 in the form of a tweet : \"Peace and harmony are central to our ethos. I appeal to my sisters and brothers of Delhi to maintain peace and brotherhood at all times. It is important that there is calm and normalcy is restored at the earliest,\" he wrote, adding in a second tweet, \"Had an extensive review on the situation prevailing in various parts of Delhi. Police and other agencies are working on the ground to ensure peace and normalcy.\"\n\nThe location in which the recent riots took place is small but significant. Muslims are being targeted by radical Hindus in the national capital, and violence has erupted without anyone in power taking decisive action to stop it. Since riots erupted, locals have accused police of standing idly by.\n\nAt present, the New Delhi police force is under the jurisdiction of the BJP-controlled Ministry of Home Affairs, not the AAP (Aam Aadmi Party), the opposition party that controls the local government in New Delhi. Before the riots, some Hindus flew saffron flags outside their shops and homes to stay safe in northeast New Delhi. A CNN reporter observed a saffron flag hoisted above a mosque.\n\nWe in India are still in the early phases of this terrifying regime, but if the world doesn't stand up and take notice soon, it will only get worse. India is very concerned about her image globally right now \u2014 it's the reason a wall was built to hide slums before Trump's visit.\n\nIn the months leading up to the US presidential election, it is imperative that Americans consider Trump's support of Modi. India is the world's second-largest country by population.\n\nIt's important for the president of the world's top superpower, as well as the candidates seeking to replace him, to condemn the ongoing hate crimes against Muslims as they unfold within the borders of an important ally and trading partner as it gains attention on the world stage.", "link": "https://us.cnn.com/2020/03/15/opinions/akanksha-singh-trump-modi/index.html", "published": "2020-03-15T00:00:00", "author": ["Opinion Akanksha Singh"]}, {"title": "Indian MP: Our nation's glorious tradition of religious tolerance is being shredded", "text": "Manish Tewari is a Member of Parliament representing Shri Anandpur Sahib Lok Sabha Constituency.

Participating in the right of dissent that is the holy grail of any constitutional democracy. Guha and others have rightfully taken a stand against the Citizenship Amendment Act, passed by the upper and lower houses of India's Parliament, which is vague and unconstitutional because it makes fast-tracked citizenship dependent on one's religion.\n\nWatching Ramachandra Guha being taken away reminded me of his riveting exposition on why India is the most fascinating country in the world. The central thesis being how India had emerged as a religiously pluralistic society when most nations have defined themselves through a monotheist lens.\n\nIndeed, India can be said to be a utopia that defines itself by the phrase \"unity in diversity.\" I wrote in an earlier op-ed that \"out of a bloodstained Partition there emerged two ideas of nationhood -- a progressive, pluralistic and inclusive impulse that became the idea of the Republic of India and a theocratic template that became the idea of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan.\" Sadly the events playing out through the actions of the government depict a trajectory that is distinct from the vision of a pluralistic society.\n\nIndia has been the birthplace of religions such as Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Jainism, which add to its cultural smorgasbord. Even the Abrahamic religions have a unique history in India. Syriac Christians in India emerged shortly after Christ died and 600 years before Islam came into being. History records that Thomas the first, one of Jesus' 12 apostles, landed in Kerala to spread Christianity and today, he is buried in Tamil Nadu. The country today is host to a significant population of the Christian faith.\n\nIslam came peacefully to the south and has a slightly more complicated history up north. Today, India has the second largest Muslim population in the world, despite not being an Islamic country. India is one of the few countries which houses members of the Jewish diaspora who have never faced any form of state-led persecution.\n\nMore interesting is the story of the Parsi community and their arrival in India. While fleeing religious persecution in Persia, they docked on Indian shores, in modern day Gujarat. Apocryphal tales have it that the King Jadhav Rana sent a bowl of milk filled to the brim, implying that he would not be able to accommodate them. The Parsis returned the same bowl of milk with sugar in it to convey that, just as the sugar had seamlessly mixed with the milk, they too would integrate effortlessly.\n\nFor centuries, India has assimilated, internalized, accommodated and embraced waves of immigrants, invaders, traders and preachers among others. The Citizenship Amendment Bill 2019 (CAB), coupled with the National Register of Citizens (NRC) -- a register of all Indian citizens whose creation is mandated by the citizenship act of 1955, subsequently amended in 2003 -- is an assault on India's pluralistic ethos. It is an affront to the first principles of constitutionalism. It violates Articles 14, 15, 16, 21, 25 and 26 and the basic structure doctrine now cast in stone in the 1973 Indian Supreme Court case of Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala, which, by a slender majority, mandated that certain articles that form the core of the Constitution are beyond even the amending powers of Parliament.\n\nIn a secular nation like India, religion cannot be the basis of citizenship, whether territorial or extra-territorial. It also militates against the first principle of reasonable classification under Article 14 -- equals cannot be treated as unequals. You cannot make religion the determinant for granting refuge, asylum or citizenship.\n\nThe act seems to be testing the waters for a pan-India NRC that would make the citizenship of billions subject to the whimsical biases and ideological predilections of those in government today in New Delhi. Moreover, the Citizenship Amendment Act adopts different benchmarks for Bangladesh and Bhutan. The government's defense is that it is meant to protect persecuted minorities in its pan-Islamic neighborhood, specifically, non-Muslim minorities in Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh.\n\nHowever, Maldives too is Islamic as per Article 10 of its Constitution. Yet, the bill does not extend the same privileges to minorities in the island nation as it does to those of Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan. Sri Lanka is a predominantly Buddhist country, where the Tamil minority (largely Hindu) have long faced persecution at the hands of pro-Sinhalese nationalists. Why does the act exclude them then? What about Ahmadis, Shias, and Baloch in Pakistan? Yes, they're Muslim, but they have been under the shoe of Sunni hardliners, and hardships have been further exacerbated by the military establishment and the constitution in Pakistan that refuses to recognize Ahmadis as Muslims. There is also the case of persecuted Christians in Bhutan.\n\nWhat would have been more magnanimous on the part of the government would have been comprehensive legislation that is holistic and welcomes all individuals fleeing persecution and not drawing arbitrary lines to gauge persecution based on religious denominations.\n\nThere are many shades of grey here and hence we need nuances separating illegal migrants from refugees and granting citizenship on a case-by-case basis in a non-discriminatory manner.\n\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion's new newsletter.

However, CNN retains full editorial control over all of its reports. Our sponsorship policy .\n\n(CNN) In Tanegashima, Japan, a spacecraft named Hope is being prepared for its launch towards Mars.\n\nIf all goes to plan, the UAE's Mars Hope Probe (or \"Al Amal\" in Arabic) will blast off this summer, reaching the Red Planet in February 2021.\n\nNot only will the arrival of the 1,350-kilogram probe coincide with celebrations for the 50th anniversary of the establishment of the UAE, but it will also mark the first time the country orbits Mars.\n\nHope's scientists, from Dubai's Mohammed Bin Rashid Space Center (MBRSC), plan to send the craft into space at the same time as NASA's Perseverance Rover and China's first Mars mission, Tianwen 1 . They are aiming to launch during the biennial window, when Earth and Mars are closest together, starting in July 2020 and going into early August.\n\nAlthough the coronavirus pandemic has forced the Emirates Mars Mission (EMM) team to adjust plans, it says it is still on track to launch on schedule.\n\n'Almost ready to launch'\n\n\"When Covid-19 came into the equation, it definitely took the complexity to a different level,\" says Omran Sharaf, EMM Mission Lead.\n\nHope was shipped to Japan three weeks earlier than planned, while a team was sent two weeks prior, allowing them time to quarantine, he says. However, this shouldn't impact the launch of the mission, he adds.\n\nJUST WATCHED The first Emirati in space Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH The first Emirati in space 02:24\n\n\"Are were ready to launch? We're almost there,\" Sharaf says. \"We continue testing until the last minute.\"\n\nTo help build the spacecraft, the EMM team partnered with a team in the US, at the University of Colorado Boulder's Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics.\n\nAccording to MBRSC, Hope will travel some 493 million kilometers, and star trackers will help position the autonomous craft into orbit. Across a distance so vast, and with so many factors outside of the team's control, Sharaf acknowledges there is a risk of failure.\n\n\"Mars is risky and Mars is difficult,\" he says. \"The mission was five times more complex than missions we have worked on before.\"\n\nProbes have been sent to Mars from Earth since the late 20th century. Recent missions include NASA's Curiosity rover , which has been snapping photographs of the Red Planet since it landed in 2012.\n\nThe Hope Probe will launch from Tanegashima, Japan, using an MHI H2A launcher, as shown in this image.\n\nThe Hope Probe is one of several space projects Dubai's MBRSC has been working on in recent years, including the launch of two satellites, sending the first Emirati into space and the ambitious goal to build a human settlement on Mars by 2117.\n\nClimate change on Mars\n\nTo find a novel science objective for Hope's upcoming mission, EMM scientists consulted the Mars Exploration Program Analysis Group ( MEPAG ), a forum created by NASA to plan explorations of Mars.\n\nEMM's Science Lead, Sarah Al Amiri, says the team settled on the goal of building the first full picture of Mars' climate throughout the Martian year, because there is a gap in data and understanding.\n\n\"There hasn't been a mission before that has taken full data sets about the Mars weather system ... throughout an entire day and at all times of day,\" she explains.\n\nStudying its weather system, including changes in the atmosphere and climate, could help lead to an understanding of how Mars -- a planet that used to share characteristics with Earth -- went from having rivers and lakes to having no water on its surface, she says.\n\n\"One of the reasons that Mars evolved to the state that it is in is atmospheric loss, and that's also one of the reasons why liquid water can't be stable on the surface,\" says Al Amiri. \"To us, water is the source of life and it's a bit of a worry that there is a planet out there in our solar system and that its climate or atmosphere started changing, and water was lost from the surface.\"\n\nPart of plans to build a settlement on Mars by 2117, the UAE has said it will build Mars Science City, as seen in this rendering, in the desert outside Dubai.\n\nTo piece together the puzzle, the probe will aim to take a variety of measurements, allowing to explore different theories. Al Amiri says the team is especially interested in a possible link between dust storms and the loss of hydrogen and oxygen -- the building blocks of water -- from the Martian atmosphere.\n\nReaching for the stars\n\nIn addition to addressing national challenges such as water security , Al Amiri, who is the Minister of State for Advanced Sciences, says the EMM has the wider goal of inspiring the UAE's youth to be interested in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM).\n\nPrior to the EMM, she says people with science backgrounds had fewer career opportunities -- often limited to education or research -- but the mission has opened up a variety of new possibilities.\n\n\"The mission created a mindset for the youth that there are opportunities for them to work in areas that they never thought they can work in,\" she says.\n\nYoung people will be important to try to transition the UAE's economy away from oil, she explains.\n\n\"For us, the EMM was a catapult for the UAE venturing into space,\" Al Amiri adds. \"It's a transition from a natural and service-based economy to one that's based on creativity and knowledge.\"", "link": "https://us.cnn.com/2020/05/19/middleeast/space-mars-hope-probe-uae-spc-scn-intl/index.html", "published": "2020-05-19T00:00:00", "author": ["Stephanie Bailey"]}, {"title": "Du Wei, the Chinese ambassador to Israel, is found dead in home", "text": "(CNN) China's Ambassador to Israel, Du Wei, was found dead inside his official residence Sunday morning, a spokeswoman for Israel's Ministry of Foreign Affairs told CNN.\n\nAt this stage, the 57-year-old's death is not being treated as suspicious.\n\nPolice are outside the ambassador's residence in Herzliya -- to the north of Tel Aviv -- as part of standard procedure, the spokeswoman said.\n\nHis death comes less than a week after US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo visited Jerusalem, openly criticizing China's actions during the coronavirus pandemic, as well as calling on Israeli leaders to stop signing major infrastructure and communications deals with Chinese companies.\n\nThere has been no comment on the ambassador's death from the Chinese embassy in Israel or the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Beijing.\n\nRead More", "link": "https://us.cnn.com/2020/05/17/middleeast/israel-chinese-ambassador-dead-intl/index.html", "published": "2020-05-17T00:00:00", "author": ["Oren Liebermann"]}, {"title": "Cholera Fast Facts", "text": "(CNN) Here's a look at cholera, an acute diarrheal infection that has killed thousands of people worldwide.\n\nFacts\n\nCholera is contracted by consuming food or water contaminated with the bacteria Vibrio cholerae.

How are you all doing?\" she asked through the television, surrounded by a gaggle of camera-wielding young adults -- her children -- acting as her crew. \"Things have changed so much, but what has not changed is I still love cooking.\"\n\nA stuck-at-home audience seems to agree, with more people than ever hungry for Food Network.\n\nTypically, a television viewer can rely on cable's most delicious channel to be a respite from the messiness of the world. However, this particular mess -- the coronavirus pandemic -- has been without boundaries. It's overtaken all aspects of life and changed it in ways that make whatever normal once existed seem like a memory more than a moment that will return -- the same feeling one might get looking at a frozen piece of wedding cake.\n\nAs productions began to shutter in the second week of March, the network was quick to realize the need for programming that spoke to the moment, and it's delivered. With a mix of filmed-at-home originals, a healthy stock of programs that had been filmed to completion but not yet aired and a vast library, the network has emerged as the keeper of the perfect recipe for pandemic programming.\n\n\"What's really interesting and encouraging and gratifying is that different types of people are coming to us for different reasons,\" Courtney White, president of Food Network, told CNN. \"It's been great to feel like our content is more needed than ever out there.\"\n\nFood for thought\n\nLast month was the network's highest rated in seven years, with increases averaging 20-30% on any given week, according to White. Some parts of its daytime lineup have even increased as much as 70%, she said.\n\nMen are watching more, too. White theorizes the rise is, in part, because some of the void left by the absence of organized sports has been filled by watching chefs go toe-to-toe.\n\n\"What we found is once sports went dark, viewers who are just hungry for competition came to us and they weren't our regular food viewers,\" she said. \"Seeing the battles play out on Food Network scratched an itch there.\"\n\nIt's true that the network serves many roles as of late.\n\nAt times, it's a guide, like when the hosts of \"The Kitchen\" did an entire episode featuring recipes based on the ingredients they already had in their pantries at home. Or when Amy Schumer and her husband, chef Chris Fischer, recent additions to the Food Network fold, found themselves quarantined without all the ingredients needed to bake their cookies, so they improvised and made a homemade answer to peanut butter cups.\n\nGuy Fieri appears on a special take-out episode of \"Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives.\"\n\nAt other times, it's repeats of traveling food shows serve as a reminder of what once was and what we long to get back to.\n\nArguably at its best, it calls attention to an industry rocked to its core.\n\nOn the charitable front, the network and its talent have been bringing awareness to the Restaurant Employee Relief Fund , which has raised over $20 million for those who have been out of work in the food industry.\n\nLocal restaurants have also been a focal point as dining rooms emptied and profits fell for many.\n\nWhen he isn't cooking nachos with Bill Murray , Guy Fieri has been ordering take-out from restaurants previously featured on \"Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives\" and consulting with owners via video chat.\n\nTrina Gregory-Propst, chef/owner of Se7en Bites bakery in Orlando, Florida, was among those featured in a recent episode.\n\nShe and wife Va Propst are set to reopen their doors on Thursday after closing completely in mid-March to focus on caring for her mother, who is high risk.\n\nFor an episode that aired last week, she sent Fieri the ingredients for a funnel cake apple pie that was served with cinnamon ice cream and a chipotle caramel drizzle. It looked as good as it sounds, and Fieri wasn't the only one salivating over it.\n\nGregory-Propst told CNN she's answered close to 500 emails from people asking if they could to get ingredients and goods shipped to them. It's a welcomed running start as she prepares to reopen.\n\n\"The amount of gratefulness that we have for how this is shifting and changing and shaping our lives at a time when we don't know really what is going to happen week to week, it's overwhelming to say the least,\" she said, her voice breaking. \"I'm sorry. I feel super emotional about it. I'm trying to hold it together, but this is our life.\"\n\nShe added: \"Our staff is like our family, and I feel like we are part of this whole big Food Network family, as well. They really make you feel like that.\"\n\nOpening up\n\nSe7en Bites is just one of many establishments looking to reopen, and this is front of mind for Food Network and, in particular, Chef Robert Irvine, host of \"Restaurant: Impossible.\"\n\nFor nine weeks, Irvine was holed up at his house in Florida, where he filmed, among other content, a special episode of \"Restaurant: Impossible\" where he checked in with owners who'd appeared on the show in the past.\n\nThough his specialty is bringing restaurants back from the brink, he knows the order is taller than ever as restaurants reopen and hope to recover.\n\nA new iteration of his show will help them do so responsibly, with a focus on precautionary measures and protocols, aimed at instilling confidence back in restaurant owners, employees and patrons alike.\n\nRobert Irvine films a quarantine special of \"Restaurant: Impossible\"\n\n\"Food Network, listen, it's a consumer facing network, but think about this: All the chefs and the owners and the managers, they all watch Food Network. So what a great platform to help relaunch America,\" he told CNN. \"How do we open up these restaurants and give the consumer that feeling of being safe?\"\n\nHis wife is among the skeptics about returning to in-person dining. She is, in many ways, his target audience, he said.\n\n\"We're going to lead that way,\" he said. \"There'll be no other network that does what we do.\"\n\nIrvine said he'll be focusing first on restaurants in areas allowed to open and places where it's \"proven that the pandemic has subsided.\"\n\nAs far as filming, he said the crew will be certainly be smaller and there's a possibility that they may quarantine on a bus after being tested for coronavirus, to assure everyone's safety.\n\nIrvine is eager to start filming and get the episodes to those who need the information across the country. He wants to help the millions of restaurant workers affected by the pandemic get back to work -- safely -- in any way he can.\n\n\"It's been a challenge for me to sit still knowing that I can make a difference in people's lives, you know?\" he said. (Though, he hasn't exactly been sitting still. His Pennsylvania distillery was quick to begin making hand sanitizer for the public and first responders.)\n\nAs of last week, White was uncertain about production timelines across the network.\n\nThe cast of \"The Kitchen\" have been producing episodes from their homes amid coronavirus.\n\n\"I think every show is going to be different, and every case is going to be different,\" she said. \"I think, obviously, the production community is really keen to get back to work. We are working very closely with production companies and talking them through plans that keep everybody safe.\"\n\nMany of the shows that have adopted stay-at-home models will continue to produce episodes in that manner through the summer, she said.\n\nOne new program starring chef Michael Symon was even born from an idea that started during the pandemic on one of the network's Facebook pages, which they have been treating as something of a test kitchen.\n\nAbout two months ago, Symon began making daily dinners on Facebook Live in response to increased requests for easy, quarantine-friendly meals. To date, the self-shot videos have amassed 30 million views, White said, and earned the rather simple concept a move to the linear network.\n\nAmong the takeaways from this time, White said, has been \"how nimble we can be and how quick we can be in production.\"\n\n\"Amy Schumer Learns to Cook\" was another lesson in swiftness.\n\nProduction on the series began within two weeks of it being pitched in late March.

Wade -- that she describes as her \"deathbed confession.\" But the documentary is most intriguing as a profile of a woman who spent time as a lightning rod for both sides of the most divisive of political issues.\n\nThe big headline out of \"AKA Jane Roe\" is McCorvey's assertion that she was paid by anti-abortion activists to switch her position on reproductive rights in the mid-1990s. \"It was all an act,\" she says in the documentary, of her much-ballyhooed about-face -- which had been attributed to her becoming a devout Christian -- proclaiming herself to be a \"good actress.\"\n\nMcCorvey -- who died in 2017 , at age 69 -- defiantly states that she doesn't care what people think of her. She was, to be sure, a complicated figure -- one who says she never actually had an abortion. Growing up under hardscrabble circumstances, she faced an unwanted pregnancy when she was recruited to serve as the plaintiff in the landmark case, only later shedding her anonymity to be embraced as an icon of the reproductive rights movement.\n\nMcCorvey later shocked her allies by declaring herself born again, switching her allegiance to the anti-abortion-rights group Operation Rescue. It was only the latest wrinkle in what a news report described as \"the furious battle that rages around all her name has stood for,\" but not the last one, given what she reveals during the interviews conducted over the last year of her life. (Operation Save America, an anti-abortion group formerly known as Operation Rescue, has denied McCorvey was paid by that group.)\n\nSweeney has a great deal of ground to cover, going back and forth between the macro issue of abortion and McCorvey's personal tale. If she was a less-than-ideal fit for the spotlight, as one abortion-rights advocate notes, only someone with limited options could have fulfilled the role that she did in arguing against Texas' restrictive abortion law.\n\nRead More", "link": "https://us.cnn.com/2020/05/22/entertainment/aka-jane-roe-review/index.html", "published": "2020-05-22T00:00:00", "author": ["Review Brian Lowry"]}, {"title": "J.K.

While smaller in tone and topic than most HBO movies, it's a solid exploration of greed and corruption, where the ultimate hero is, of all things, a teenage journalist.\n\nBased on a magazine article about a scam in the Long Island community of Roslyn, the small-town vibe falls somewhere between \"The Positively True Adventures of the Alleged Texas Cheerleader-Murdering Mom\" (look it up, it's a real HBO movie, and a good one) and the recent college admissions scandal.\n\nIn this case, superintendent Frank Tassone (Jackman) is an accomplished con man, who has worked with Pam Gluckin (Janney) to bilk the school board in a multi-million-dollar embezzlement scheme. While the numbers might not add up, everyone is positively giddy about the high school's rising status -- graduating more kids into prestige schools -- and the higher property values that come with owning homes in a sought-after school district.\n\nIt's 2002 when a reporter for the school paper, Rachel (\"Blockers'\" Geraldine Viswanathan), gets assigned a \"puff piece\" about a skywalk that's supposed to be built, but the glad-handing Frank encourages her to aim higher -- that it's only a puff piece if she lets it be. Those are words he'll come to regret, as Rachel begins poring over school records, discovering that those production orders, and a lot else, seem fishy.\n\nDirected by Cory Finley from Mike Makowsky's script, \"Bad Education\" (which premiered last fall at the Toronto Film Festival) skips over a lot of details that come to mind -- like how Frank and Pam hatched the plot in the first place, and what made them so sure they could get away with it.

But sampling its lineup, a more controllable flaw is that the shows generally aren't very good, which -- for a programming venture -- is more than a mere quibble.\n\nAlthough the highest-profile fare includes \"Movies in chapters\" -- slicing dramatic stories into 7-to-9-minute sections as \"episodes\" -- the titles that work best are unscripted, which feels more suited to snack-sized video consumption.\n\nAs for any coherence to the selections, there really isn't any. Seemingly emulating Netflix, Quibi -- which is kicking off with a 90-day free trial -- appears to want to be some things to all people, delivering a hodgepodge of ideas ultimately defined more by the format than its content.\n\nQuibi made more than two dozen individual offerings available to preview, so depending on personal preferences and interests your mileage might vary. That includes self-help fare, cooking shows, a revival of \"Punk'd\" (with Chance the Rapper) and news, sports, entertainment and latenight compilations, the last group basically approximating what you can see on those screens offering clips at the gas station.\n\nThere's utility in that, although it's tough to envision a true test of Quibi's value until life returns to semblance of normalcy, with people moving about and having small windows of time to fill while they wait in lines and the like.\n\nRead More", "link": "https://us.cnn.com/2020/04/06/entertainment/quibi-review/index.html", "published": "2020-04-06T00:00:00", "author": ["Review Brian Lowry"]}, {"title": "Social distancing TV is finding its groove -- and discovering its limits", "text": "(CNN) Several weeks into the TV-produced-from-home phenomenon, a few things are becoming clear: The closer a show's format is to a couple of people talking, the better it generally fares in this environment, while others don't translate nearly as well.\n\nLate night talk shows have adapted the most seamlessly, in what feels like a throwback to earlier days of broadcasting, which relied on pioneers like Jack Paar and Steve Allen to hold the viewer's attention minus any modern frills.\n\nGranted, the hosts have missed having audiences and the energy they derive from appreciative laughter, but they've been broadly effective.\n\nIn some cases, the conversations in venues like \"The Late Show With Stephen Colbert\" -- where the host's dog has become an occasional co-star -- even feel more intimate and relaxed, like being privy to a private chat between two famous people than the usual appearance. That might be due, in part, to the fact there's less promotion involved, since shilling for upcoming movies or TV shows feels like a little awkward.\n\nThe at-home approach is also compelling the hosts to reveal more of themselves -- and their families . The same goes for guests, such as Jason Bateman's young daughter essentially photo-bombing him this week during \"Jimmy Kimmel Live.\"\n\n\" allowfullscreen>\n\n\"You can't really do anything that fake. It's really you,\" \"The Tonight Show's\" Jimmy Fallon said during an MSNBC interview on Tuesday. \"It's showing your real character. ... It's bizarre, but this is the times we're living in.\"\n\nJohn Oliver's HBO show \"Last Week Tonight\" has weathered the shift almost without missing a beat, while working the new minimalism into the comedy. Bill Maher, by contrast, has essentially traded in his panel for individual interviews, while continuing to provide staples like \"New Rules\" and using clips of laughing audiences as a garnish to his monologue.\n\nMusic has also proved to be a natural, deeply personal vehicle for offering what amounts to acoustic shows. That will include the \"One World: Together at Home\" concert on April 18, which will play on multiple networks, featuring an eclectic roster of artists to raise funds intended to address the needs unleashed by Covid-19.\n\nAt the same time, there are obvious limits. \"Saturday Night Live\" deserves credit for the inventive nature of its \"at home\" experiment , but the revolving solo-shtick approach to sketch comedy began to feel almost oppressive and more than a little claustrophobic. Granted, \"SNL\" is often a trifle flabby, but 90 minutes of that felt like more than the exercise could reasonably sustain.\n\nSimilarly, ESPN's stunt with a remote \"HORSE\" competition -- the one-on-one basketball game built around trick shots -- was amusing for all of about 10 minutes, at which point the novelty and technical limitations began to take its toll. Yes, everyone is hungry for live sports, but after watching that, there's something to be said for those NBA Playoff reruns after all.\n\n'Sesame Street: Elmo's Playdate.'\n\nAs it stands, one of the more creative efforts thus far has been \"Sesame Street: Elmo's Playdate,\" a star-studded special that played on HBO. Then again, that ran slightly less than 30 minutes, and puppets don't have to worry about social distancing.\n\nEveryone deserves to be cut slack as they find their way through this unprecedented period. But the lessons that programmers are learning now should inform what they're doing not only in the near term, but over the long haul, especially with the likelihood that social-distancing methods will be necessary, off and on, for an extended stretch.\n\nThat said, watching a lot of these programs in a week has somehow simultaneously stoked admiration for those soldiering on and made one yearn for TV like they used to make it way back in February of 2020 -- as loud, gaudy and filled with the sound of actual human laughter and applause as you can get.", "link": "https://us.cnn.com/2020/04/17/entertainment/social-distancing-tv/index.html", "published": "2020-04-17T00:00:00", "author": ["Analysis Brian Lowry"]}, {"title": "Remdesivir alone is not enough, researchers conclude in first major Covid-19 trial of the drug", "text": "(CNN) Researchers have finally published the data that led the federal government to recommend the use of the antiviral drug remdesivir in very ill coronavirus patients, and they say the drug alone will not be enough to help patients.\n\nThe data, published in the New England Journal of Medicine , show the drug shortened the course of illness from an average of 15 days to about 11 days.\n\n\"Preliminary results of this trial suggest that a 10-day course of remdesivir was superior to placebo in the treatment of hospitalized patients with Covid-19,\" the researchers wrote.

They said they won't be giving such a high dose in future studies.\n\nOffit said the immunogenicity data was \"not impressive,\" especially since all of the doses -- even the \"low\" dose -- were actually very high, he said. Combined with the side effects, he recommended that the CanSino researchers give up on their efforts.\n\n\"I think they should stop,\" said Offit, who previously developed a successful rotavirus vaccine. \"I have to believe there are other candidates out there that are going to do better than this.\"\n\nDr. Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at the Baylor College of Medicine, also wasn't thrilled with the findings. \"I'm not impressed with this,\" he said.\n\nStill, he said researchers should keep studying the vaccine, either to use on its own or alongside another vaccine in what's called a prime-boost approach.\n\n\"The good news is, (the vaccine) is producing neutralizing antibodies, which scientists think is important for protective immunity against Covid-19,\" said Hotez, who is also working on a vaccine against Covid-19. \"What is less certain is whether the levels of neutralizing antibody are high enough to confer complete protection, or whether this will be partially protective.\"\n\nClinical trial in China will study 500 volunteers\n\nThe vaccine from the Beijing researchers uses what's called an adenovirus vector. Adenoviruses can cause the common cold, but in this case, they're weakened and modified to deliver genetic material that codes for a protein from the novel coronavirus.\n\nThe body then produces that protein and, ideally, develops an immune response against it. In the new study, the vaccine produced a complex immune response, prompting most volunteers to produce both T-cells that should attack the coronavirus and antibodies as well.\n\nThis particular vaccine used an adenovirus strain called adenovirus 5. People who had some immunity to that strain did not seem to respond as well to the vaccine, the researchers said.\n\nChen called the results encouraging but said more research is needed.\n\n\"The trial demonstrates that a single dose of the new adenovirus type 5 vectored COVID-19 (Ad5-nCoV) vaccine produces virus-specific antibodies and T cells in 14 days, making it a potential candidate for further investigation,\" he said.\n\n\"However, these results should be interpreted cautiously. The challenges in the development of a COVID-19 vaccine are unprecedented, and the ability to trigger these immune responses does not necessarily indicate that the vaccine will protect humans from COVID-19.\"\n\nHe said the result \"shows a promising vision for the development of COVID-19 vaccines, but we are still a long way from this vaccine being available to all.\"\n\nAccording to The Lancet's press release, researchers have initiated a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in Wuhan, China to further test the vaccine -- the gold standard for clinical research.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nThe study will look at 500 healthy adults, according to the Lancet, with half of the volunteers given the middle dose, 125 given the low dose, and 125 given a placebo.

But for some, the burden of isolation and uncertainty is becoming hard to bear.\n\nThis \"stay at home awhile longer\" advice recognizes that older adults are more likely to become critically ill and die if infected with the virus. At highest risk are seniors with underlying medical conditions such as heart, lung or autoimmune diseases.\n\nYet after two months at home, many want to go out into the world again. It is discouraging for them to see people of other ages resume activities. They feel excluded. Still, they want to be safe.\n\nGrowing isolation\n\n\"It's been really lonely,\" said Kathleen Koenen, 77, who moved to Atlanta in July after selling her house in South Carolina. She's living in a 16th-floor apartment while waiting to move into a senior housing community, which has had cases of Covid-19.\n\n\"I had thought that would be a new community for me, but everyone there is isolated,\" Koenen said. \"Wherever we go, we're isolated in this situation. And the longer it goes on, the harder it becomes.\"\n\n(Georgia residents age 65 and older are required to shelter in place through June 12, along with other vulnerable populations.)\n\nHer daughter, Karestan Koenen, is a professor of psychiatric epidemiology at Harvard University's T.H. Chan School of Public Health. During a Facebook Live event this month, she said her mother had felt in March and April that \"everyone was in [this crisis] together.\" But now, that sense of communality has disappeared.\n\nMaking it worse, some seniors fear that their lives may be seen as expendable in the rush to reopen the country.\n\n\"[Older adults] are wondering if their lives are going to end shortly for reasons out of their control,\" said Dr. Linda Fried, dean of the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia University, in a university publication. \"They're wondering if they'll be able to get the care they need. And most profoundly, they're wondering if they are going to be cast out of society. If their lives have value.\"\n\nBattling despair\n\nOn the positive side, resilience is common in this age group. Virtually all older adults have known adversity and loss; many have a \"this too shall pass\" attitude. And research confirms that they tend to be adept at regulating their reactions to stressful life events \u2014 a useful skill in this pandemic.\n\n\"If anything, I've seen a very strong will to live and acceptance of whatever one's fate might be,\" said Dr. Marc Agronin, a geriatric psychiatrist and vice president of behavioral health at Miami Jewish Health, a 20-acre campus with independent living, assisted living, nursing home care and other services.\n\nSeveral times a week, psychologists, nurses and social workers are calling residents on the campus, doing brief mental health checks and referring anyone who needs help for follow-up attention. There's \"a lot of loneliness,\" Agronin said, but many seniors are \"already habituated to being alone or are doing OK with contact [only] from staff.\"\n\nStill, \"if this goes on much longer,\" he said, \"I think we'll start to see less engagement, more withdrawal, more isolation \u2014 a greater toll of disconnection.\"\n\nErin Cassidy-Eagle, a clinical associate professor of psychiatry at Stanford University, shares that concern.\n\nFrom mid-March to mid-April, all her conversations with older patients revolved around several questions: \"How do we keep from getting Covid-19? How am I going to get my needs met? What's going to happen to me?\"\n\nBut more recently, Cassidy-Eagle said, \"older adults have realized the course of being isolated is going to be much longer for them than for everyone else. And sadness, loneliness and some hopelessness have set in.\"\n\nShe tells of a woman in her 70s who moved into independent living in a continuing care community because she wanted to build a strong social network. Since March, activities and group dining have been canceled. The community's director recently announced that restrictions would remain until 2021.\n\n\"This woman had a tendency to be depressed, but she was doing OK,\" Cassidy-Eagle said. \"Now she's incredibly depressed and she feels trapped.\"\n\nA blow to mental health\n\nEspecially vulnerable during this pandemic are older adults who have suffered previous trauma. Dr. Gary Kennedy, director of the division of geriatric psychiatry at Montefiore Medical Center in New York City, has seen this happen to several patients, including a Holocaust survivor in her 90s.\n\nThis woman lives with her son, who got Covid-19. Then she did as well. \"It's like going back to the terror of the [concentration] camp,\" Kennedy said, \"an agonizing emotional flashback.\"\n\nJennifer Olszewski, an expert in gerontology at Drexel University, works as a geriatric psychiatric nurse in three nursing homes in the Philadelphia area. As is true across most of the country, no visitors are allowed and residents are mostly confined to their rooms.\n\n\"I'm seeing a lot of patients with pronounced situational depression,\" she said \u2014 \"decreased appetite, decreased energy, a lack of motivation and overall feelings of sadness.\"\n\n\"If this goes on for months longer, I think we'll see more people with functional decline, mental health decline and failure to thrive,\" Olszewski said.\n\nSome are simply giving up. Anne Sansevero, a geriatric care manager in New York City, has a 93-year-old client who plunged into despair after her assisted living facility went on lockdown in mid-March. Antidepressant and anti-anxiety medications have not helped.\n\n\"She's telling her family and her health aides 'life's not worth living. Please help me end it,'\" Sansevero said. \"And she's stopped eating and getting out of bed.\"\n\nThe woman's attentive adult children are doing all they can to comfort their mother at a distance and are feeling acute anguish.\n\nCoping strategies for family\n\nWhat can be done to ease this sort of psychic pain? Kennedy of Montefiore has several suggestions.\n\n\"Don't try to counter the person's perception and offer false reassurance. Instead, say, yes, this is bad, no doubt about it. It's understandable to be angry, to be sad. Then provide a sense of companionship. Tell the person, 'I can't change this situation but I can be with you. I'll call tomorrow or in a few days and check in with you again.'\"\n\n\"Try to explore what made life worth living before the person started feeling this way,\" she said. \"Remind them of ways they've coped with adversity in the past.\"\n\nIf someone is religiously inclined, encourage them to reach out to a pastor or a rabbi. \"Tell them, I'd like to pray together or read this Bible passage and discuss it,\" Kennedy said. \"Comforting person-to-person interaction is a very effective form of support.\"\n\nDo not count on older adults to own up to feeling depressed. \"Some people will acknowledge that, yes, they've been feeling sad, but others may describe physical symptoms \u2014 fatigue, difficulty sleeping, difficulty concentrating,\" said Julie Lutz, a geropsychologist and postdoctoral fellow at the University of Rochester.\n\nIf someone has expressed frequent concerns about being a burden to other people or has become notably withdrawn, that's a worrisome sign, Lutz said.\n\nHow to get help\n\nIn nursing homes, ask for a referral to a psychologist or social worker, especially for a loved one who's recovering from a Covid hospitalization.\n\n\"Almost everybody that I'm seeing has some kind of adjustment disorder because their whole worlds have been turned upside down,\" said Eleanor Feldman Barbera, an elder care psychologist in New York City. \"Talking to a psychologist when they first come in can help put people on a good trajectory.\"\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.", "link": "https://us.cnn.com/2020/05/25/health/seniors-distress-depression-coronavirus-pandemic/index.html", "published": "2020-05-25T00:00:00", "author": ["Judith Graham", "Kaiser Health News"]}, {"title": "Corona with Lyme? Warmer weather means it's time to be tick aware", "text": "(CNN) As warm weather sends people outdoors, some are encountering tenacious pests with no respect for social distance.\n\nForget staying 6 feet apart: Ticks go for blood in the hardest-to-reach places on the human body.\n\nMany of those ticks are infected with Lyme disease . The illness, which was first identified in Connecticut in the 1970s, is found in countries across the Northern Hemisphere. It's the most common tick-borne disease in both the United States and Europe.\n\nAnd the area where Lyme disease is found is expanding.\n\nLyme disease is on the rise in the United Kingdom, and climate change is projected to worsen the spread of Lyme across northern Europe.\n\nAccording to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there's now a high incidence of exposure in Midwestern, Northeastern and mid-Atlantic states.\n\nAnd while it's still too soon to say how bad ticks will be this year, some indicators point to a population surge in the early part of the season in the United States. Reported sightings of ticks via the University of Rhode Island's crowdsourced TickSpotters survey were up 80% in March over last year.\n\nIt doesn't necessarily mean the tick population increased by that much. The program's director, entomologist Thomas Mather \u2014 you can call him \" The Tick Guy \" \u2014 said the increase could reflect higher numbers of ticks, people spending more time outside or a combination of the two factors.\n\nThe tick population is likely to fluctuate throughout the season anyway, said Mather, who is a professor in the department of plant sciences and entomology at the University of Rhode Island. \"What we see in real time isn't always a good prognosticator for what could be happening a month or two months from now.\"\n\nBy April and May, reports were closer to what Mather saw in 2019. But even if tick numbers hold steady for the rest of the warm-weather months, encounters with the tiny arachnids will remain a serious issue.\n\nNot only can ticks carry Lyme disease, they may bring other illnesses as well. When left untreated, some of these can be deadly for both humans and pets.\n\nAnd as sunny days send people outside to breath fresh air amid the pandemic, the risk of contracting a tick-borne disease or infection goes up wherever ticks can be found. Here's what you need to know about staying tick-safe this year.\n\nWhat are the most serious tick-borne illnesses?\n\nWorrying about the coronavirus pandemic doesn't mean other threats have gone away.\n\n\"There are numerous tick-borne pathogens that are on the rise ,\" said Allison Gardner, a medical entomologist and assistant professor of arthropod vector biology at the University of Maine.\n\nGardner noted that the United States contends with the parasitic infection babesiosis ; it's also found in Europe.\n\nAs with Lyme disease, early symptoms of anaplasmosis include fevers, chills, headaches and muscle aches. Antibiotics are effective against anaplasmosis, but if left untreated, the disease can be fatal. Those with compromised immune systems are at especially high risk.\n\nIn Europe, the viral tick-borne encephalitis is a problem, with 3,092 confirmed cases in European Union countries in 2018. There is an effective vaccine against the disease, which can cause fevers, headaches, paralysis and convulsions. (Other tick borne-diseases in Europe include tick-borne relapsing fever, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever and Mediterranean spotted fever.)\n\nThe most common tick-borne danger in both the United States and Europe, however, is still from Lyme disease. And the vast majority of cases may go undetected.\n\nSome 30,000 Lyme disease diagnoses are reported to the CDC each year, but the agency estimates that actual cases in the United States may be 10 times higher than that. A 2016 report in the Journal of Public Health estimated 85,000 annual cases of Lyme in Europe, noting that reporting is inconsistent and that many of these cases are likely undiagnosed.\n\nEarly symptoms of Lyme disease include fever, chills, headache, muscle aches and a distinctive bull's-eye rash that expands from the bite itself. (Though a rash is a well-known sign of the infection, it occurs in 70% to 80% of cases.)\n\nIf left untreated, Lyme-disease symptoms can eventually worsen to include facial palsy, heart palpitations and severe joint pain.\n\nStay tick-safe in the outdoors\n\nGardner, the University of Maine medical entomologist, spends her days in the field dragging a light-colored cloth through tick habitats. The ticks grab onto the fabric, where their dark bodies show up clearly.\n\nThat's a research trick you can adapt to protect yourself. \"Light-colored clothing can make it easier to spot the ticks on you,\" said Gardner, whose work puts her in frequent close contact with the tiny creatures.\n\nOther ways to protect against ticks include tucking pants into socks. Since ticks crawl up from the ground, this makes it easier to spot them before they slip beneath your clothes.\n\nTreating clothing and shoes with the insecticide permethrin can be effective, too, especially when combined with a DEET-containing insect repellent used on the skin.\n\nThere are also ways to protect the area outside of your home against ticks. The University of Rhode Island's online Tick Encounter Resource Center recommends a variety of home projects , starting with raking leaves, cutting low-hanging branches and trimming back shrubs.\n\nThe kind of plants you have in the yard matters as well. Studies in the United States have found especially high tick numbers in place with the invasive plants Japanese barberry and bush honeysuckle , both of which were introduced as ornamentals.\n\n\"Removing these invasive plants in the landscape have the additional benefit of inhibiting exposure to tick-borne pathogens,\" Gardner said.\n\nLooking for ticks \u2014 and what to do if you find one\n\nEven if you're practicing scrupulous tick safety when outside, it's essential to inspect yourself and your kids for ticks when you come back in.\n\nThat means a full-body check: Partner with someone who can inspect every corner of your body, or use a handheld mirror to peer into hard-to-see places. Some places where ticks are easy to miss include your ears, inside your belly button, underneath the arms and on the backs of your knees.\n\n(A careful check should take a minute or two \u2014 long enough to listen to a few verses of \"Ticks,\" a Brad Paisley song that's the unofficial anthem of vector-borne disease safety.)\n\nRinsing off can help as well. Showering within two hours of coming inside can reduce the risk of Lyme disease, according to the CDC. When hit with water, unattached ticks may simply wash down the drain.\n\nIt's a good idea to check your clothing, too. If you're worried there may still be ticks on your clothes, drying them for 10 minutes at high heat will kill any hangers-on, since washing alone won't do the trick.\n\nShould you find a tick attached to your skin, it's important to remove it as soon as possible.\n\nHave a pair of fine-tipped tweezers on hand, and use them to grasp the tick close to the skin, pulling it off with steady, gentle pressure. (This CDC fact sheet shows the process in more detail.)\n\nIf you develop a rash or fever within a few weeks of finding a tick, contact your health care provider.\n\nIn areas with a high incidence of Lyme disease, it's a good idea to check in anyway; depending on how long the tick has been attached or embedded, the provider may recommend further treatment or monitoring.\n\nWhat about your pets?\n\nThere are two considerations when it comes to pets and tick safety: keeping them safe, and ensuring you're not exposed to ticks that they bring into the home.\n\nHave a plan in place to safeguard your companion dog from tick-borne diseases.\n\nIn the United States, dogs are susceptible to tick-borne Lyme disease, ehrlichiosis, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, hepatozoonosis , anaplasmosis and babesiosis. European dog owners must watch out for babesiosis as well.\n\nSome of these diseases can be fatal.\n\nFortunately, dogs can be vaccinated against the bacterium that causes Lyme disease. (Even during the pandemic, many veterinarians are open for treatments, including vaccinations.)\n\nFor protection from other threats, the University of Rhode Island's Tick Encounter recommends combining the vaccination with additional tick-preventative treatments\n\nCats do not appear to be susceptible to Lyme disease. In the southern United States, however, they can catch the tick-borne Cytauxzoon felis, a parasitic disease that is often fatal. To protect your cat and your household, it's important to use a tick-preventative treatment if the animal spends time outdoors.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nFor both cats and dogs, as with people, a thorough visual check is also a good way to screen for ticks.

The city said 14 days of decline were needed before they moved to reopen. Sunday would have been the 13th day of decline -- but instead there was a small spike over the last two days.\n\nBut because the spike was a small one, health officials say they'll consider setting back to the 11th day of the decline instead of starting the count from the beginning.\n\n\"We don't have to go to day zero,\" Director of the DC Department of Health, Dr. LaQuandra Nesbitt, said in a news conference call.\n\nThere are two other factors officials will consider before reopening: A positivity rate of less than 20% and a hospital capacity of less than 80%.\n\nAs of Sunday, the city's positivity rate is 19% and hospital capacity is at 74%.\n\nA 17-year-old dies in Georgia\n\nIn Georgia, one of the first states to begin reopening, officials reported Sunday the state's youngest coronavirus death.\n\nThe victim was a 17-year-old boy, according to data from the Georgia Department of Public Health. The boy had underlying medical conditions. The department didn't offer any further details.\n\nThe boy's death is a grim reminder that while officials have cautioned elderly populations are at a higher risk for complications related to an infection, younger people fall victim to the virus as well.\n\nIt also includes the 5-month old daughter of a New York firefighter, who died late April after spending a month in the hospital receiving treatment for the virus.\n\nThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say that while many young people who got coronavirus did not have serious problems, health experts are investigating a virus-related complication in children across the country, dubbed multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children.\n\nSymptoms may mostly include stomach pain and vomiting, along with fever and perhaps a rash, experts say.\n\nWhite House rolls out travel restrictions\n\nAs US officials try to get a handle on the spread of the virus, President Donald Trump announced Sunday he was suspending travel into the US for people who had been to Brazil within the past two weeks.\n\n\"I have determined that it is in the interests of the United States to take action to restrict and suspend the entry into the United States, as immigrants or nonimmigrants, of all aliens who were physically present within the Federative Republic of Brazil during the 14-day period preceding their entry or attempted entry into the United States,\" the President's proclamation reads.\n\nBrazil now is second to the US with the highest number of coronavirus cases, recording more than 363,200 infections, according to Johns Hopkins.\n\nOver the weekend, the country recorded more than 15,000 new infections in just 24 hours.", "link": "https://us.cnn.com/2020/05/25/health/us-coronavirus-memorial-day/index.html", "published": "2020-05-25T00:00:00", "author": ["Christina Maxouris"]}, {"title": "Covid-19 cases surge in some states as Americans celebrate Memorial Day weekend", "text": "(CNN) Just because you can go to the beach or bars doesn't mean it's time to let your guard down.

Many are closed for safety precautions , so when the heat becomes unbearable, it could feel like there's no place left to go.\n\nHowever, there are ways to feel comfortable without cranking the air conditioning unit or going without. Here are more than 12 methods for cooling your body and buffering your house from the outside heat.\n\nStay hydrated\n\nWhen you're hot and flushed, hydrating yourself is the first and foremost step to cooling down, said Wendell Porter, a senior lecturer in agricultural and biological engineering at the University of Florida.\n\nThe temperature of the water doesn't matter since your body will heat it, he added. If your body is suffering from the heat and needs to cool itself, it can't perform the function without enough moisture.\n\nTake a cold shower or bath\n\nTaking a cold shower or bath helps cool your body by lowering your core temperature.\n\nFor an extra cool blast, use peppermint soap. The menthol in peppermint oil activates brain receptors that convey whether something you're eating or feeling is cold.\n\nUse cold washrags on your neck or wrists\n\nPlace a cold washrag on your wrists or drape it around your neck to cool your body. These pulse points are areas where blood vessels are close to the skin, so you'll cool down more quickly.\n\nUse box fans\n\nPlace box fans facing out of the windows of rooms you're spending time in to blow out hot air and replace it with cold air inside.\n\nIf the weather in your area tends to fall between 50 and 70 degrees Fahrenheit in the mornings and evenings, open the windows during those times to facilitate a cross-flow ventilation system. The outdoors can pull the hot air from your home, leaving a cooler temperature or bringing in the breeze. Just be sure to close windows as the sun comes out, then open them when the weather is cool again.\n\nUsually we might not leave windows open in consideration of crime, but while we're home during this time, this method could be feasible, Porter said.\n\nResting near a fan would reduce just your body temperature.\n\nClose your curtains or blinds\n\nIf you have windows that face the sun's direction in the morning through afternoon, close the curtains or blinds over them to \"keep the sun from coming directly into the house and heating up [the] inside,\" Porter said.\n\nYou could also install blackout curtains to insulate the room and reduce temperature increases that would happen during the day.\n\nIf you do turn the air conditioning on, don't drop it to below 70 degrees Fahrenheit in an effort to cool the house faster, said Samantha Hall, managing director of Spaces Alive, a design research company helping to create healthy, sustainable buildings.\n\n\"It just runs for longer to reach that temp and will keep going until you start to feel a bit chilly and is then hard to balance,\" she added. Instead, keep the unit temperature as high as possible while still comfortable.\n\nSleep in breathable linens\n\nCotton is one of the most breathable materials, so cotton sheets or blankets could help keep you cool through the night.\n\nThe lower the thread count of the cotton, the more breathable it is, Porter said. That's because higher thread counts have more weaving per square inch.\n\nSleep in the basement\n\nIf you can't sleep through the night because you're too hot, you may not have to stay in your bedroom. Heat rises, so if you have a lower or basement level in your home, set up a temporary sleeping area there to experience cooler temperatures at night.\n\nDon't refrigerate or freeze blankets or clothing\n\nCommon advice for staying cool without air conditioning includes refrigerating or freezing wet socks, blankets or clothing then ringing them out for sleep. But this isn't a good idea, Porter said.\n\n\"The amount of energy they can absorb from your body that night, they will be warm in just a matter of minutes,\" he said. \"And then you'd have damp stuff that would mold your mattress. So you definitely don't want to do that.\"\n\nClose the doors of unused rooms\n\nIf no one's using a room, close it off to keep the cool air in only occupied areas of the house.\n\nUse the exhaust fan in your kitchen and/or bathroom\n\nFlip the switch for the exhaust fan in your kitchen to pull hot air that rises after you cook or in your bathroom to draw out steam after you shower.\n\nInstall energy-efficient light bulbs\n\nIncandescent light bulbs generate a higher temperature than LED light bulbs do. To make the switch, watch for sales on energy-efficient bulbs then slowly replace the bulbs in your house, Porter said.\n\nSwitching light bulbs can save money but won't reduce a lot of heat in the home, Hall said. But if you focus on switching the bulbs in areas you're sitting near, that would make a more noticeable difference, Porter said.\n\nCook in the morning, with a slow cooker or outside\n\nOven heat can spread throughout your house. Keep the heat centralized in one area, such as a slow cooker. Or, cook outdoors on a grill to keep the heat outside.\n\nEnjoy frozen treats\n\nEating an ice pop or ice cream to cool down may help for a moment. But don't go overboard on the sugar if you're overheated or at risk of being overheated, Porter said.\n\n\"Sugar would run your metabolism up and you'd start feeling internally hot,\" he said. \"So the cool treat might be good, but the extra sugar might not.\"\n\nResearch what your state offers\n\nIf you've tried everything and still can't beat the heat at home, you could look online for any local programs that are offering ductless air conditioners.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nDepending on your state, some cooling centers may be open and taking precautions to ensure they're as safe as possible.

Looking at the seven-day rolling average of new cases, it appeared the state had reached a high point similar to one from about a month ago, the governor said.\n\n\"It's clear and evident to me that we have one peak, and then we've had a deep dip, and then we're having a second peak right now and they're really about 30 days apart,\" Hutchinson said.\n\nThe governor attributed the rise in cases in part to an expanded testing effort in the state.\n\nAmong those new cases were some that stemmed from a high school swimming party in northeast Arkansas, the governor said.\n\nHutchinson said he was sure everybody thought the party \"was harmless,\" but \"positive cases resulted from that.\"\n\n\"During this Memorial (Day) weekend, we want to be out and we want to enjoy ourselves, we want to remember this holiday and those that have served our country and given their lives in service of our country,\" he said. \"But let's be safe and let's be disciplined at the same time.\"\n\nHutchinson declined to provide further details about the swim party.\n\nNavajo Nation enters another weekend lockdown\n\nThe Navajo Nation , with one of the highest per-capita coronavirus infection rates in the United States, has entered another weekend lockdown.\n\nThe Native American territory spans parts of Arizona, New Mexico and Utah.

The products purported \"to mitigate, prevent, treat, diagnose or cure Covid-19 in people,\" but were unapproved drugs sold in violation of federal law, the letters said.\n\nThe second letter was issued to North Coast Biologics, which was allegedly offering a vaccine.\n\nIn March, a person involved with North Coast Biologics bragged about the purported vaccine on Facebook, the letter said. \"Just vaccinated 12 people in west Seattle tonight . . . 12 more to vaccinate in Burien,\" it said.\n\nThe group allegedly said it would make the vaccine available to those who are either at risk or for anyone who simply needs reassurance. It edited its social media post last month, saying it was no longer available because of a \"cease and desist\" letter from the Attorney General.\n\nBut the misleading claims remained online, federal officials said. Both groups did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment.", "link": "https://us.cnn.com/2020/05/23/health/us-coronavirus-saturday/index.html", "published": "2020-05-23T00:00:00", "author": ["Jason Hanna", "Dakin Andone", "Amir Vera"]}, {"title": "How to help children with ADHD thrive in a virtual schoolhouse", "text": "(CNN) When schools shut down because of the coronavirus , some parents of children with ADHD found themselves in a stressful predicament.\n\nIt means parents who are likely ill-equipped are dealing with learning and behavioral differences that their children's school professionals may have been trained to manage.\n\nAs the school year comes to an end for many students around the world, there are lessons to be learned as parents consider virtual summer school or camps and anticipate virtual school in the fall.\n\nA neurodevelopmental disorder commonly diagnosed in childhood that often lasts into adulthood, ADHD stems from underdeveloped or impaired executive function and self-regulation skills, according to Harvard University's Center on the Developing Child . Those skills help us to plan, focus attention, remember instructions and multitask.\n\nChildren may have trouble paying attention, controlling their impulses or may be overly active.\n\nThese symptoms allow children to do well in some environments \u2014 fast-paced or creative \u2014 but they can also be severe and cause difficulties at home or school and with friends. That's why children with ADHD need a school environment that helps them stay on track, maintain a structure and be supported by peers and teachers.\n\nThe sudden switch to virtual learning has greatly upset this routine.\n\nLeslie Hall of Charlotte, North Carolina, said her sixth grader's shift to virtual learning was tough at first. The constant influx of assignment notifications across several platforms distracted her son, Sam.\n\n\"The first week I could barely keep up,\" she said. \"He'd be working on a science assignment and the social studies teacher would send a text with her assignment so naturally he'd jump to that. Then another teacher would send an assignment and he'd jump to that. For a kid who likes order, it led to a lot of frustration.\"\n\nTiffany Johnson of Fort Worth, Texas, said her eighth grader is finally settling into virtual learning after weeks of volatile challenges.\n\nJohnson witnessed her son having small meltdowns over technological difficulties, misunderstanding assignments and group projects with classmates who didn't understand him.\n\nShe's used to working from home, but sometimes she has had to sit with her son all day to help him manage online school. She's also dealing with her own depression and anxiety on top of her son's issues.\n\n\"The stress of a global pandemic, a new day to day that changes week to week, technology challenges and frustrations,\" she said, \"some days it's really hard because if I'm not level, he won't be level ,\" Johnson said.\n\nJeanine Kalulu of Vista, California, helps her grandson with his schoolwork while she works from home and her daughter, who is an essential worker, works elsewhere.\n\nThey've faced numerous obstacles, including equipment and technological issues, restlessness and distraction. The in-class aide and one-on-one time he had didn't transfer to a virtual medium, and the classes weren't engaging to him.\n\n\"He did get upset one time because he didn't want to do the lesson, and he said it's boring,\" Kalulu said. \"We were doing [the lesson] on the phone at that time because he couldn't get it on the laptop. So he threw the phone down.\"\n\nNow, he does only the paper assignments, mainly because his school hasn't yet provided him with a laptop and so he can't access the online lessons.\n\na neurodivergent child while working from home and work through frustrations together. There are ways parents can help their kids thrive in remote learning, balance homeschooling witha neurodivergent child while working from home and work through frustrations together.\n\nBenefits of a school structure\n\ntraditional school settings, said Robin Nordmeyer, co-founder and managing director of the Children with ADHD benefit from the structure oftraditional school settings, said Robin Nordmeyer, co-founder and managing director of the Center for Living Well with ADHD -Minnesota, an ADHD coaching group serving all ages.\n\nA traditional school allows a student to show up and go through the motions of a class structure. The school bell's ring helps signal a clear-cut transition between classes, and between school and home life. The consistent, predictable routine helps some students stay on track.\n\nChildren with ADHD also draw from the community and connection schools can provide, complete with peers and educators who model behavior, offer emotional support and champion the educational or social goals of the student.\n\n\"What's happened with Covid-19 is we've shifted from having that infrastructure and support from school,\" Nordmeyer said. \"And parents have had to pick up a lot of the things that can't be provided with virtual learning. And maybe they don't know how best to help them because they haven't been trained in that particular area of need.\"\n\nat Commonwealth Academy in Alexandria, Virginia, a day school for students with learning differences or ADHD challenges. \"So that makes it twice as hard.\" \"Parents are having to take on that responsibility as well, while they still have their own routines and jobs to get through during the day,\" said Anabelle Morgan , head of schoolat Commonwealth Academy in Alexandria,Virginia, a day school for students with learning differences or ADHD challenges. \"So that makes it twice as hard.\"\n\nMimic the school environment\n\nChildren with ADHD don't struggle with paying attention in general as much as they struggle with concentrating and sustaining attention on the right things, Nordmeyer said.\n\n\"When a child is struggling from inattention,\" she added, \"anything around them in their environment can grab their attention in the moment, take them offtrack and get them caught up in something else that's not related to the goal of the moment.\n\n\"[They] might start off great paying attention, but then our brains wear out a bit. [They] use up that dopamine or that neurotransmitter availability and it's just hard to focus, concentrate and pay attention to what [they're] trying to do.\"\n\nGiven that they're prone to jetting off in a different direction, creating a mock space that borrows from their school environment is the first step in remote learning.\n\nInstead of having them do schoolwork in their bedroom, parents can set up a small desk with few distractions in an area that's easy for parents to monitor. It can be across from where the parent is working, or parents and children can sit side by side while working on their own assignments.\n\nStructure each day\n\nOne parent tweeted that homeschooling her child with ADHD was an all-day affair. When trying to structure their child's day, parents should practice structure, not micromanagement, Nordmeyer said.\n\nParents could start by having morning huddles with their child at the same time each day to map out the day's flow. They can talk about any Zoom meetings, check-ins with educators, assignment deadlines or any other upcoming time commitments,\n\nIn the absence of a set schedule, parents can co-create one with their child.\n\nusing Nordmeyer recommendedusing the Pomodoro method , in which parents would write on a sticky note what the child's assignment is for the next 25 minutes or so \u2014 for example, \"Do problems one through 12 for your math worksheet.\" Children could work alongside their parents or at their workstations, while parents or both parties monitor a timer. Then they take a five-minute break.\n\n\"This is something that will really help children work through what they feel is overwhelming to them, and it will also break it down to something they can manage,\" Nordmeyer said. \"It creates some consistency in the focus and what they're doing throughout the day.\"\n\nPull them back from distractions\n\nIf a child is having trouble becoming really distracted, parents can help pull him back by shortening the work time. Decrease the amount of time he works on assignments divided appropriately, and allow more room for moving and refreshing before coming back to start again.\n\n\"Meet the child where they're at,\" Nordmeyer said. \"If they can do something for 10 minutes, expect that.\"\n\nIf there's computer schoolwork, parents could try ensuring the only browser open is one that's relevant to the task at hand. Depending on whether the computer is privately owned or the school's property, parents can customize internet router settings to block some games or sites for certain hours of the day, Morgan said.\n\nSocial and emotional support\n\nChildren with ADHD still need emotional and social support to stay engaged. They've likely already found ways to virtually connect with their friends via their phones.\n\nParents should monitor the mental health status and mood levels of their child, Nordmeyer said. Some school counselors and teachers may still be available for virtual one-on-one meetings for mental and educational support.\n\nMix in stimulating activities\n\nBecause some kids with ADHD are hyperactive, they need to move, Nordmeyer said. They have a kinetic connection to how they learn and process information, so fidgeting may help them to pay attention. Desk work all day burns them out.\n\nStimulating activities add excitement, boost endorphins and help manage the hyperactivity and impulsivity children try to keep under control while doing schoolwork. Indoor or outdoor recesses with physical or creative activities in the morning, around lunchtime and in the afternoon can help them to get their energy back up and be productive once they return to their desk.\n\n\"Exercising really counteracts that and [can be] a normalizer when it comes to those neurotransmitters, which means that students, after exercising a lot, can concentrate better,\" Morgan said. \"The children again feel like they're a little bit more in control.\"\n\nThemed days, such as \"cooking in the kitchen day,\" can keep things interesting and expand a child's skill set, Nordmeyer added.\n\nBalancing homeschooling while working from home\n\nStructuring a child's day with the Pomodoro timed assignment method can allow parents to work while a child focuses intermittently on school. They can also develop a system for what the child can do while the parent finishes a project.\n\nThis system could include visual communication signals. If there's a red cup on the table, for example, that could mean children should not interrupt the adult except for an emergency.\n\nIf a child needs constant assistance, parents could create a visual chart that helps the child know when a parent is busy or available. With two parents, they can discuss when they're able to pick up homeschooling responsibilities.\n\nParents could also enlist the virtual assistance of grandparents, aunts, uncles or babysitters who understand the child's learning differences and can get on the phone with the child as he or she works on assignments.\n\nDealing with frustrations and roadblocks\n\nIf academic or other roadblocks arise during the week, don't push through to get the child under control and back on track, Nordmeyer suggested. And don't tell them to \"calm down,\" since saying that can have the opposite effect, Morgan cautioned.\n\nInstead, find ways to pause and breathe. For children, that might mean having them play or run outside. Maybe meditate with them, take a walk, listen to soothing music or practice breathing.\n\nThen acknowledge how the child feels, ask her what she needs and proceed.\n\nThis gives the child agency and avoids the emotional hijack or fight-or-flight response of the brain that results in misunderstandings, defiance or hurt feelings, Nordmeyer said. That response is more easily triggered in people with ADHD.\n\nTake time to reflect\n\nAt the end of the week, parents should sit with their child to both reflect and think ahead, Nordmeyer said.\n\nThis is the time to decompress and debrief when the school week is nearly over or done. In the opinions of parents and children, what went well? What could be improved upon? What are the goals for the next week?\n\nShine the light on what's right, Nordmeyer suggested.\n\n\"We hear too many things about what went wrong, and all that does is cause emotional outbursts and shuts everybody down, right?\" she added. \"So pay more attention to what is right.\"\n\nParents may want to look for an ADHD coach if their child is in middle or high school, Nordmeyer said, as parents and teens may do better with a third party involved. Parents can focus on the dynamics of their relationship while an ADHD coach supports the teen through learning challenges.\n\nParents can also create weekly notes of highs and lows for teachers, so everyone is on the same page. And communicating with the child's school helps educators and therapists to understand what's working and what's not, and how to support, Morgan suggested.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nAdditionally, with help from the school, parents could create opportunities for other parents to virtually come together to share ideas, frustrations, suggestions and support one another, she added.\n\nAt the end of the day, parents should \"be compassionate\" toward where they and the child are at, Nordmeyer said. This situation is unparalleled, and really, the future is unknown.", "link": "https://us.cnn.com/2020/05/23/health/online-school-children-adhd-coronavirus-wellness/index.html", "published": "2020-05-23T00:00:00", "author": ["Kristen Rogers"]}, {"title": "States and beaches reopen ahead of Memorial Day weekend", "text": "(CNN) After weeks under stay-at-home orders, Americans should feel free to go outside and enjoy Memorial Day weekend as long as they practice social distancing and follow other guidelines, the nation's leading infectious disease expert said.\n\n\"We'll be having people who want to get out there and get fresh air,\" Dr. Anthony Fauci said at a CNN coronavirus town hall. \"You can do that.

Viral infection tests are used to determine if a person currently has an active case of the coronavirus whereas antibody tests are used to look for traces of a past infection.\n\nAll 50 US states have now taken steps to ease stay-home restrictions.

All were hospitalized from late December to mid-April and had died or been discharged by April 21. Just below 15,000 were treated with the antimalarial drugs hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine, or one of those drugs combined with an antibiotic.\n\nThose treatments were linked with a higher risk of dying in the hospital, the study found. About 1 in 6 patients treated with chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine alone died in the hospital, compared to 1 in 11 patients in the control group.\n\nAbout 1 in 5 patients treated with chloroquine and an antibiotic died and almost 1 in 4 treated with hydroxychloroquine and an antibiotic died.\n\n\"Previous small-scale studies have failed to identify robust evidence of a benefit and larger, randomised controlled trials are not yet completed,\" Dr. Frank Ruschitzka, director of the Heart Center at University Hospital Zurich and the study's coauthor, said in a statement.\n\n\"However, we now know from our study that the chance that these medications improve outcomes in Covid-19 is quite low,\" he said\n\nPresident Trump has repeatedly touted hydroxychloroquine as a potential coronavirus treatment. Earlier this week he said he was taking daily doses of it as a prophylaxis to prevent infection.\n\nFauci 'cautiously optimistic' about Moderna vaccine\n\nMeantime, the race for a vaccine continues with more than 124 potential vaccines in development around the globe, according to the World Health Organization. Ten potential vaccines are in clinical trials.\n\nFauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, is \"cautiously optimistic\" about a vaccine candidate from Moderna, he said Thursday.\n\nThe company, which is working with NIAID, announced this week that early data from its phase 1 clinical trial showed positive results in volunteers who received the vaccine . Of the dozens of study participants, eight developed neutralizing antibodies at levels reaching or exceeding those seen in people who have naturally recovered from Covid-19.\n\nNeutralizing antibodies bind to the virus, disabling it from attacking human cells.\n\n\"Importantly, it induced the kind of response that you would predict would be protective against the virus,\" Fauci said.\n\n\"So although the numbers were limited,\" he added, \"it was really quite good news because it reached and went over an important hurdle in the development of vaccines.\"\n\nModerna's vaccine received clearance to begin Phase 2 trials -- and it's not alone.\n\nA vaccine developed by CanSino Biological Inc. and the Beijing Institute of Biotechnology has begun a phase 2 trial in Wuhan, China.\n\nCDC issues new guidance on symptoms\n\nAbout a third of coronavirus infections have no symptoms, the CDC said in new guidance.\n\nThe CDC said its \"best estimate\" is that 0.4% of people who show symptoms and have Covid-19 will die. And an estimated 40% of coronavirus transmission occurs before people feel sick.\n\nIn the most severe scenario, the CDC assumes that 1% of people overall with Covid-19 and symptoms will die. In the least severe scenario, it puts that number at 0.2%.\n\nThe guidance is intended for modelers and public health officials.

And that boredom, combined with the fear of getting sick or actually getting sick, could make for a cruel summer.\n\nBut wait. There really is still fun to be had. With a little bit of imagination, we can set ourselves free from that cage of coronavirus. We can play silly games. Connect with family and friends.

In this episode, CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta gives his own advice about going out into the world, finding purpose and leading the way.\n\nYou can listen on your favorite podcast app or read the transcript below.\n\nA lot of people are doing what they can to celebrate the high school and college classes of 2020 from their homes.\n\nFrom actors to athletes to Oprah.\n\nOprah Winfrey, entertainer and philanthropist: Never has a graduating class been called to step into the future with more purpose, vision, passion and energy and hope.\n\nGupta: You know, I've been thinking a lot about this myself. I look at my three children, and I think a lot about the world that they're growing up in. So I decided I would share some of my own thoughts and maybe even a little advice about going into the world in these troubled times.\n\n...\n\nTruth is, most people will never remember their graduations, let alone their commencement speakers. It is yet another formality in a day and a time of life when such formalities are certainly important, but mostly symbolic. I don't remember much about my own graduation, except that I was wearing a robe \u2014 and it was lunchtime.\n\nI remember that moment when I realized that a page had been turned in my life, that over the last several years I had learned something. I was more informed, I was better at solving problems and could more easily navigate my way through life. I hoped I had better judgment and could add some real value to the world.\n\nTruth is, I didn't know what I was doing. And, I didn't know where life would lead me. I just followed a few basic rules.\n\nListen more than talk. After all, I already knew whatever it was I was going to say \u2014 so better to hear the other guy out. It was a valuable skill because it allowed me to be a true lifelong learner.\n\nAnother rule \u2014 never hold a grudge. They're just They're just toxic and serve no real purpose in our short time here on earth. And for that matter, regrets, jealousy and revenge would all be put in the same category. So many times, I have been thanked for my advice when all I basically did was listen and then tell the person, \"Just let it go.\"\n\nFinally \u2014 be kind. I learned early on when you practice kindness, it feels good somehow. Internally. Like something clicks into place. That I am fulfilling some sort of prophecy. It is a sort of reciprocal altruism. Doing good feels good. I don't think that's an accident. My guess is that \"reciprocal altruism\" was a trait, preserved and selected for in the human race. It allowed our species of human beings to survive and thrive much more than \"rugged individualism\" or \"survival of the fittest.\"\n\nI think the point is this: We human beings are somehow programmed at a deep molecular level to take care of each other\n\nAnd it is more important now than ever.\n\nThis is a consequential time, and yours is a consequential commencement. You are being unleashed and unbridled into the world at a time when it matters more than I can remember in my 50 years of life.\n\nMy childhood was fairly serene, compared to yours. It was post-Vietnam, the economy was relatively stable and terrorism was mostly depicted in the movies.\n\nIf you were born at the beginning of this century, at the beginning of this millennium, however, you were just a year old when the United States suffered the worst terrorist attack on its home soil. By your third birthday, the country would become immersed in two of the longest wars in its history. By your eighth birthday, you would've watched your parents struggle through the Great Recession.\n\nIn middle school and high school, the existential threat of climate change made it feel to you like the trees would no longer be so green, that the birds would no longer sing so sweetly and that the world as we knew it might come to an end far sooner than our imagination had previously allowed. And now, you are dealing with the biggest health threat of the last 100 years.\n\nWe could not have imagined when we rang in the new year 2020, sitting closely, arm in arm, even sharing a kiss as the clock struck midnight, that within a few weeks, our lives would completely change. And, yet \u2014 that is what happened.\n\nAt once the tragedy, the irony and the beauty of life. And we miss the ebbs and flows of life, the mountains and valleys, the rise and the fall of our years on the planet \u2014 told to primarily stay at home. Life somehow feels a little flatter, a little grayer, a little less Technicolor.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nYes, an infection has taken hold of our planet ... and life will have to change for a while. We will have to stay home, reflect more and go deeper within ourselves.\n\nThere is no vaccine yet. There is no magic therapeutic. There is just each other. And never before have we been so dependent on one another, and we must rise to that challenge. You newly minted graduates must set the example, lead the way and show us a better tomorrow.\n\nClass of 2020, this time is your time. I know that must sound crazy. But, we will get through this. I know that, and we may likely be better \u2014 and stronger \u2014 and more capable of dealing with this in the future. And we'll probably learn a lot about ourselves along the way.\n\nNever does the human race achieve so much as when our backs are up against the wall.\n\nFinally, graduates \u2014 as a father myself \u2014 I want to remind you to start that practice of kindness, that practice of gratitude today.\n\nWhile it is your commencement, it may also represent the ending of another era. Of the dependence on your family, your parents, the people who have supported you along the way.\n\nRemember to say thank you today, look the person in the eye when you do and feel it deeply in your heart.\n\nCongratulations, class of 2020!\n\n...\n\nAnd thank you for listening.

The food is soft and warm. It's sweet, salty or umami. It addresses senses such as smell, taste and touch, or what it feels like in our mouths.\n\n\"I think, for most people, comfort food is nostalgic,\" said Dee Pernell , a naturopathic physician and founder and CEO of First Batch Artisan Foods , an ice cream parlor in Atlanta. \"It's heavy; it's warm; it's comforting and it feels like a big hug.\n\n\"It can trigger pleasure sensors when we eat certain foods, and especially when [we] taste foods from times where we had no bills or responsibility or no Covid-19.\"\n\n\"It's extremely important right now because we're feeling like we don't have control over anything,\" she added. \"So much is unknown and food is really what grounds us.\n\n\"Comfort food plays to all [of our] senses at once, and I think that's what you find pleasurable experiences do.\"\n\nTo make delicious vegan comfort food, it's important to understand the elements that make traditional common comfort foods so delicious \u2014 and to keep vegan versions as close to the original as possible, Toyota said.\n\nWhen you need to satisfy those cravings, here's what both professionals said you should know and have on hand. Below, we've also included some mouthwatering recipes to get you started.\n\nRequirements for baking good vegan cookies and brownies\n\nTo make vegan cookies and brownies as soft, moist and chewy as non-vegan cookies, brown sugar and white sugar have to be at the right ratios, Pernell said.\n\nPernell's vegan cookies have a decadent balance of sugar and fat.\n\nBrown sugar \"creates that sort of chewy texture in a cookie, while the [white] sugar, when it melts, it gives the cookie more moisture,\" she said. \"The two of those together along with the [vegan] butter and the right amount of flour make the perfect cookie.\"\n\nAny store-bought vegan butter can replace dairy butter or boxed mixes that require oil, Toyota said. Ground flaxseed and water or aquafaba (chickpea brine) can substitute for eggs. Two tablespoons ground flax and one-third cup of water simulate the texture of one egg. Three tablespoons of aquafaba act as one egg, and it's also good for making meringue, Toyota said.\n\nVegan brownies can be fudgy and chewy in the way people remember traditional brownies.\n\nAnd don't skimp on the quality of your ingredients for any of these foods, Pernell advised.\n\nHigh-quality ingredients such as chocolate or cocoa with high fat content greatly contribute to the flavor and richness of the end product, she said. On the back of chocolate packaging, look for at least 20% to 24% fat \u2014 the higher, the better.\n\nWhat you need to make delicious vegan cinnamon rolls and cobblers\n\nFor cinnamon rolls, mimic any non-vegan recipe. Plant-based milk can replace dairy. Aquafaba for eggs may be a better substitute as it wouldn't darken the color. Use vegan butter for regular butter. Vegan cream cheese can be used for the frosting.\n\nThe star of peach cobbler is the crust, and you can still mimic a traditional recipe. Use cold vegan butter, cut into pieces from sticks, to fold into the batter and give the finished product that familiar bite, chew and crunch. For the peaches, mix your traditional spices first then adjust if needed. Then add vegan butter.\n\nThe fundamentals of cooking vegan soul food\n\nSoul food, a cuisine associated with African Americans in the southern United States, includes black-eyed peas, collard or mustard greens, cornbread and mac and cheese, to name a few. All can be easily made vegan, with maybe the exception of smoked meat in greens.\n\n\"For the soul food, I literally use all the exact spices that [my grandmother, mother and aunts] would use to season their food,\" Pernell said.\n\nTo achieve the same flavor as meat, smoke hickory wood chips in water on the stovetop and then use that pot to cook the peas and greens, Pernell suggested. You can also pour in a bit of liquid smoke, which is sold in the condiments section in many stores.\n\nFor indulgent mac and cheese, reserve some of the pasta water. For the creamy, cheesy texture and flavor for a 1 pound box of pasta, Pernell recommended using 1 cup of pasta water; 2 cups of plain, unsweetened almond or soy milk; 1 cup of nondairy cheese; and the same seasonings (such as salt, pepper, granulated garlic and onion, and paprika).\n\nFor melt-in-your-mouth cornbread, use a traditional recipe with a few swaps: the flax mixture or aquafaba for eggs; soy, almond or oat milk for milk and vegan butter for regular butter.\n\nCrucial elements of creamy vegan ice cream\n\nGood vegan ice cream involves the \"perfect combination of fat and sugar together that creates a specific mouthfeel and reminds people of what they're accustomed to getting,\" Pernell said.\n\nYour dairy substitute should be higher in the ratio of fat to sugar, so the ice cream won't feel dry and icy in your mouth. Pernell recommended using coconut cream. Oat milk and cashew milk are also good substitutes.\n\nHow to make vegan 'chicken' noodle soup\n\nYou'd think the flavor of chicken is essential to chicken noodle soup, but \"a lot of the time the flavoring is coming from the plant-based ingredients like spices and garlic,\" Toyota said.\n\nWhile you can't get the fat element that meat would provide, you can use vegan butter or oil to achieve the silky texture of the soup. Mirepoix, the combination of onions, celery and carrots sauteed in fat, forms the base. Bottled poultry seasoning, with sage, thyme and other herbs, does its part. You could use vegetable stock, or chicken-flavored bouillon cubes, to get closer to an authentic flavor.\n\nHot for Food's vegan chicken noodle soup is reminiscent of a longtime family favorite.\n\nIf you want, use vegan chicken alternatives.\n\nEssentials of indulgent vegan pastas and lasagnas\n\nVegan pastas or lasagnas with rich sauces, cheesiness and meaty flavor are possible. To a traditional tomato sauce recipe, you could add balsamic vinegar for umami flavor, Toyota said.\n\nHot for Food's vegan bolognese is vegetable-based but hearty.\n\nUse a mushroom mince or meat alternative to replace the ground beef. You can also find vegan cheese in the grocery store.\n\nBuilding blocks of vegan nachos\n\nOne recipe Toyota is famous for is her vegan nacho cheese sauce.\n\n\"It's so reminiscent of the nostalgic, pumped cheese you would get at the fair or movie theater all over the tortilla chips,\" she said.\n\nHot for Food's nacho cheese is a favorite among some vegan food fans.\n\nIt's made with vegetables. Under the cheese and other ingredients of your choice, you could use beans to replace the meat. Or cook up some veggie ground beef in taco seasonings \u2014 find it in the freezer section of your supermarket.\n\nFor sour cream, blend raw cashews with lemon juice or vinegar for acidity and brightness. Or use unsweetened plain coconut yogurt, since it's sour.\n\nNecessities for flavorful vegan gravy and biscuits\n\nWhat's good about gravy is the umami flavor, the savory taste of glutamates that we sometimes recognize as meat or fish flavor. The word has Japanese origins, Toyota said: Umami means \"deliciousness,\" and the discovery stems from kombu seaweed.\n\n\"It is just so satisfying,\" she added. \"It hits you on the whole tongue and it's the thing that just makes you say, 'Oh, that tastes good.' And you don't even know why.\"\n\nMushroom- and tamari- or soy sauce-based gravies have that flavor because of their own glutamates. In either, you can use vegetable broth or bouillon cubes, miso paste, shallots and garlic sauteed in oil or vegan butter, and herbs like rosemary or thyme.\n\nHot for Food's vegan gravy is just as savory as a traditional recipe.\n\nUse cold, hard vegan butter in biscuits to achieve flaky layers, Toyota recommended. For buttermilk, use any nondairy milk with apple cider vinegar or lemon juice for acidity and thickness. The acidity helps the rising agents (baking powder or soda) to react, and the finished product to be flaky.\n\nHot for Food's cheesy chive biscuits are as flaky as their non-vegan counterparts.\n\nTime to experiment\n\nThese tips are some of the fundamentals of making good vegan comfort food, and they can apply to many other recipes.\n\n\"It's a great time now with us having more time at home to just get in the kitchen and explore different things,\" Pernell said. And, do your research about ingredients that work well or fall short and \"don't be disappointed if a recipe doesn't turn out well,\" she added.\n\n\"I've done tons and tons of things before I got it right.\"", "link": "https://us.cnn.com/2020/05/22/health/vegan-comfort-food-recipes-wellness/index.html", "published": "2020-05-22T00:00:00", "author": ["Kristen Rogers"]}, {"title": "Take stock of your mental health during the pandemic (and what to do next)", "text": "(CNN) The reality of job losses, economic uncertainty, social isolation, homeschooling kids , canceled vacations \u2014 all piled on top of fear of an unseen and deadly virus that attacks via the air we breathe \u2014 is taking its toll.\n\nMost of us are stressed. Really stressed.\n\nSome 56% of American adults say worry or stress has led to \"at least one negative effect on their mental health and well-being, such as problems with sleeping or eating, increased alcohol use or worsening chronic conditions,\" according to a late April poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nIt doesn't help that much of the advice we've gotten on how to protect ourselves from the virus has been unclear and worse yet, varies by city, state and even by country. And it's often contradictory, experts say.\n\n\"The government's response to the pandemic is clearly something that is driving stress,\" said clinical psychologist Vaile Wright, the senior director for health care innovation at the American Psychological Association.\n\n\"What we know from research on previous pandemics is that psychological distress is increased when leaders provide inconsistent, unclear and non-scientifically based information to the people that they lead,\" Wright said. \"These inconsistent messages drive up stress and distress.\"\n\nMonmouth University Poll conducted over the first week of May found 55% of Americans believed President Donald Trump has been largely inconsistent in his statements about the pandemic, often changing what he says about the coronavirus from day to day.\n\n\"People are looking for a steady hand in a crisis,\" said Patrick Murray, director of the independent Monmouth University Polling Institute, in a statement. In the same poll, US state governors received widespread praise for the handling of the coronavirus outbreak, with 73% of Americans saying they are doing a good job.\n\n\"State officials and public health professionals have largely been consistent in their approach to the pandemic. This is one reason why satisfaction with their response has been high and stable throughout, unlike views of the President's actions,\" Murray said.\n\nAll this stress comes along at a time when parts of our society were already at risk.\n\n\"Even before the pandemic, our data was telling us mental health was moving in the wrong direction for young people,\" said Kathleen Ethier, a social and behavioral scientist at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, during a Thursday mental health forum.\n\n\"In the last 10 years we've seen increases in high school students saying they felt so sad and hopeless, they couldn't participate in activities,\" Ethier said.\n\nAdd in the stress of social isolation from friends and family and missing milestones such as birthdays and graduations, and pressure mounts, experts say.\n\n\"The health community has known for years isolation has a detrimental effect on mental health,\" said The Carter Center's Eve Byrd in the Thursday online forum.\n\nByrd directs the mental health programs at The Carter Center , where former First Lady Rosalynn Carter has long been a champion of efforts to reduce stigma and discrimination against people living with mental health and substance use disorders.\n\n\"Talking about and making it OK to talk about what you are experiencing \u2014 we need to model that for younger people and make sure they know that it's OK,\" Byrd said. \"The pandemic increased that conversation for all of us, no matter our age or situation.\"\n\nHow to tell if you need help\n\nThere are key signs you can look for, in yourself and in loved ones, that can signal growing anxiety, depression, panic attacks or potential suicidal behaviors.\n\nAnxiety: Having difficulty concentrating, poor sleep, restlessness and irritability are signs that anxiety may be taking over your life in an unhealthy way, Having difficulty concentrating, poor sleep, restlessness and irritability are signs that anxiety may be taking over your life in an unhealthy way, according to the American Psychological Association . Persistent or excessive worry about your health or finances, often feeling overwhelmed by emotions and a general sense that something bad is going to happen are more signals.\n\nPanic attacks: At times, anxiety can spiral out of control, leaving you in a full-fledged panic attack. You may feel as if you're having a heart attack: Your heart rate may speed up or pound in your chest. You may tremble, sweat, feel like you're choking or have shortness of breath and feelings of dread.\n\nSuch attacks can happen suddenly, without warning, and leave some people \"fearful about when the next episode will occur, which can cause them to change or restrict their normal activities,\" the APA said.\n\nDepression: Depression often begins with a lack of energy and interest or pleasure in daily activities. You may develop an inability to concentrate and feel worthless or guilty about an action or the lack thereof. Paradoxically, you can experience significant weight loss or gain a lot of weight; You can also either sleep all the time or develop insomnia and sleep little. You may even begin to think of death or suicide.\n\nSigns of suicidal thoughts: Often triggered by a recent loss through death, divorce or separation, many of the signs that a person is at risk for suicide duplicate those of depression and anxiety: a loss of interest in friends or hobbies; changes in sleep patterns, eating habits and personality; low self-esteem, sadness, withdrawal, irritability and feelings of guilt or worthlessness,\n\nPeople who are at risk for suicide may begin behaving erratically and talk about dying or harming themselves. They may show \"no hope for the future, believing things will never get better or nothing will change,\" according to the APA.\n\nWhat you can do for yourself\n\n\"It's not inevitable that people with chronic stress will have negative outcomes,\" Wright said. \"If you can identify the things that are in your control and then engage in healthy behaviors, you can mitigate some of that stress.\"\n\nJust what is in our control during a time when we know so little about the outcome of the pandemic?\n\n\"The three things that are in your control are your thoughts, your feelings and your behaviors,\" Wright explained. \"Focus on those, identify things that are unhealthy and try to transfer them to beliefs that are healthier, then that's you taking an active approach to managing your stress.\"\n\nChoose healthy behaviors. Instead of sitting on that couch, go outside and get some fresh air, sunshine and exercise, experts suggested. Exercise naturally creates endorphins, the body's feel-good hormones. Eating healthy, staying away from excess alcohol (a depressant) and getting plenty of sleep will also put your body \u2014 and mind \u2014 in a better mood.\n\nIncrease your social connections. \"Social connection is one of the No. 1 stoppers of stress,\" Wright said.\n\nBut how can one do that appropriately and safely during this time? \"Pay attention to what your local reopening plan is, what is allowed and what's not allowed,\" Wright suggested. \"Then it really becomes a question of your own personal risk-benefit analysis.\"\n\nIf you've been taking care of your health, working and sheltering at home with the same family or friend unit, keeping 6 feet away from others outside, wearing a mask and avoiding people at the grocery store, it may be safe to meet a friend who's done the same for a 6-feet apart walk in the park with a mask, Wright said.\n\n\"However, if I'm immunocompromised, or have elderly parents living with me, then my risk of making myself or my parents ill increases and may decrease my desire to want to engage in that behavior,\" she added.\n\nFor many of us, the smart choice is to remain as isolated from the masses as possible. But that doesn't mean you have to give up on social connections.\n\n\"Instead of just relying on social media, we can make a list of the 10 or 20 people that we care the most about and put them in our phone on a rotating basis. We're going to call one of those people every day,\" said trauma psychologist Shauna Springer , who has spent a decade working with military veterans suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, also known as PTSD.\n\nNext, Springer suggested adding more people from our outer ring of friends and associates that we may not be as close to and put those people into that daily call rotation. That's especially critical if you think those people may be especially isolated right now.\n\n\"Reaching out and connecting with people, especially those who are especially isolated, and giving them space to talk about their experience and anxiety during this unprecedented time of anxiety and then sharing our own experience is how we will get through this,\" she said. \"When we connect, we survive.\"\n\nSearch out support. \"Look to the people in your own life that can be supportive and can help you,\" said the CDC's Ethier. \"Find people who can listen and help support you and also tell you their own stories.\"\n\nIf that isn't possible, there are federal, state and local resources. Of course, if the situation is potentially life-threatening, get immediate emergency assistance by calling 911. If it's not, then \"start with the distress hotlines,\" Ethier said. \"They are really good, and go way beyond what we think of as suicide hotlines.\"\n\nThe Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, or SAMHSA, has a national helpline \u2014 800-662-HELP (4357) \u2014 which provides free, confidential treatment referral and information in English and Spanish 24/7 every day of the year.\n\nThe American Psychological Association also has a webpage of resources for suicide, substance abuse and domestic violence\n\nSeek ongoing therapy. If you have health insurance, getting therapy has never been easier. Most clinics and therapists are offering phone or video telehealth visits. Many employers are offering free access to therapists as part of their employee benefit plans, and many communities have mental health centers with sliding scale fees.\n\nMany people don't choose to go to therapy, said experts, because they believe that makes them \"weak\" or feel it would be too invasive.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n\"The general public does not understand what therapy means,\" said Byrd. \"They might say, 'Oh my gosh, I am not going to be laying on a couch telling my deepest, darkest thoughts.

But what is not OK is if we don't do something about it.\"", "link": "https://us.cnn.com/2020/05/22/health/mental-health-pandemic-wellness/index.html", "published": "2020-05-22T00:00:00", "author": ["Sandee Lamotte"]}, {"title": "This morning yoga routine in bed will boost your energy", "text": "(CNN) The countless hours that many of us have spent sitting at a makeshift desk in quarantine can be detrimental not only physically but also mentally. Hunched over a computer day in and day out, you're not just wreaking havoc on your posture , but you're likely feeling out of sorts and drained, too.\n\nIf you're waking up feeling stressed or overwhelmed with the thought of beginning another day in isolation, a daily yoga practice can be helpful. Practicing brief sessions of yoga and mindfulness can significantly improve energy levels and brain function.\n\nAlong with the physical practice of yoga, the breathwork, called pranayama, has a significant positive impact on energy levels and cognitive function. Research has shown that slow, steady breathing linked with movement helps reduce stress and improve autonomic and higher neural center functioning.\n\nThink about a yoga practice as a cup of coffee: You turn to coffee because it tastes good and makes you feel sharper mentally. Similarly, you can turn to yoga because it feels good and helps you feel more energetic. But if you're intimidated by the idea of a long class or are worried that you don't have enough experience to begin yoga, have no fear.\n\nQuarantine can be a great time to start a brief, daily practice first thing in the morning.\n\nA collection of studies reported that Need more reasons to start? Here's some inspiration:A collection of studies reported that regular practice of yoga improves serotonin levels, decreases depression and anxiety, increases blood flow, allowing more oxygen to reach the body cells and thus enhancing their function, and improves flexibility and functional mobility in people with chronic pain.\n\nThat's why I created this five-minute yoga routine to loosen up your body and start your day off feeling calm, balanced and positive. As a certified yoga instructor for over a decade, I encourage my clients to engage in a daily yoga practice (preferably in the morning) to get the blood flowing, boost energy and invigorate the senses.\n\nThese poses are strategically included because they open up the body physically, improve blood flow to the vital organs and stretch the front, back and sides of the body in a short amount of time.\n\nPractice all of these poses with the pranayama breath: Breathe in through your nose and out through your nose. Breathe slowly and mindfully, and sync your breath with your movements.\n\nLying-down starfish pose\n\nSimilar to standing goddess pose, lying down in a starfish position opens up the chest, lungs, back and torso. To perform this pose, simply reach your arms overhead while lying in bed, and stretch your legs out long. Open your legs wider than your hips, and open your arms out further than your shoulders. Stretch through your fingers and toes as far as you can.\n\nFor an added bonus, curl up into a ball by hugging your knees into your chest and curling your head up toward your knees. Release and come back into starfish pose. Repeat this five times. Inhale as you open up into starfish pose, and exhale as you curl up, hugging your knees into your chest.\n\nThe compression of internal organs as you curl up into a ball squeezes the organs in the front of your body; as you release, fresh blood and oxygen floods these areas while you're expanding into starfish pose.\n\nSeated cat and cow pose\n\nNow come up to a cross-legged seated position on your bed. Place your hands palms down on your knees. Sit up tall as you lift your chest, arch your low back and press your hands into your knees to lift your torso. Inhale here.\n\nExhale as you round your back, pulling your naval in toward your spine and holding onto your knees to pull your spine away from your knees. Drop your chin toward your chest. Repeat this five times.\n\nThis pose improves mobility and flexibility in the spine and also opens up the chest. This movement stimulates the lungs while stretching the chest, and stretches the back of the body to help with stiff or sore upper- and lower-back issues.\n\nSeated twist\n\nSitting cross-legged, inhale and reach your arms up toward the ceiling. Exhale as you twist to the right, and place your left hand on your right knee and your right fingertips behind you on the bed. Inhale to lift up taller, and exhale to pull your naval in toward your spine to twist further, looking over your right shoulder. Hold for three slow, deep breaths, and then release. Repeat to the left side.\n\nTwists, like the first pose of this sequence, allow fresh oxygen and nutrients to flow to the internal organs upon release. Furthermore, twisting stimulates blood circulation and helps release tension in the abdominal area. Twists open up the upper back and counteract slumped posture.\n\nSeated wide-leg forward fold with clasped hands\n\nSitting upright, open your legs out as wide as you can. It may be helpful to prop yourself up and sit on a pillow if your legs \u2014 or low back \u2014 are very tight. Flex your feet, and engage your quads. Next, clasp your hands behind your back to open up your shoulders and your chest. Inhale as you sit up tall, and then exhale to slowly fold forward.\n\nIf you are brand-new to yoga or very inflexible, you may not lean over very far. Hold this position wherever you are to feel a stretch in your inner thighs and chest. Hold for three slow, deep breaths.\n\nThis upper body stretch provides an opportunity to not only improve posture by bringing the shoulders back, but also improve lung capacity by expanding the rib cage freely as you breathe in. The lower-body stretch focuses on loosening up the hips and inner thighs that are often tight from sitting for extended periods of time.\n\nStanding side stretch\n\nTime to rise and shine! Stand up next to your bed and place your feet on the ground as wide as your hips. Place both hands on your hips, and slowly lean to the right. Press down with your left foot as you feel a stretch along the left side of your body. Inhale here to expand the left side of your body, and exhale as you come up to center. Inhale to lean over to the left to stretch the right side of your body, and exhale as you come up to center.\n\nRepeat this three times to each side.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nThis yoga pose improves flexibility in the torso and wakes up the side-to-side movement of the spine. It also stretches the intercostal muscles between the ribs, which can improve breathing.\n\nThis energizing yoga routine can be performed daily to train your body and mind to stress less, release tension, feel more relaxed and use your breath to cultivate more space mentally and physically.", "link": "https://us.cnn.com/2020/05/22/health/morning-yoga-bed-exercise-wellness/index.html", "published": "2020-05-22T00:00:00", "author": ["Stephanie Mansour"]}, {"title": "CDC and 11 states acknowledge mixing results of viral and antibody tests", "text": "(CNN) The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention acknowledged on Friday it had mixed together results from viral and antibody coronavirus tests on its website.\n\nEleven states also confirmed mixing viral and antibody test results.\n\nThe CDC says it's planning to separate those numbers in the coming weeks, but experts say the current method is unhelpful and potentially misleading.\n\nThat's because antibody tests aren't used to diagnose current infections or determine whether someone is potentially contagious. Instead, they indicate whether someone has been exposed to the virus in the past.\n\nCombining numbers from antibody and viral tests pushes up the total number of tests conducted in the US. But antibody tests are often intended for the general public -- not just people with suspected infections -- so they can skew a key indicator of how the pandemic is progressing: the percentage of tests that come back positive.\n\nThe CDC's method makes it appear that the US has greater capacity to test than it really does, at least when it comes to identifying current infections.\n\n\"It's not useful information, unless you have a political agenda that you're trying to back up. That's really the only reason to do that,\" said CNN medical analyst Dr. Celine Gounder, a professor of medicine and infectious diseases at the New York University School of Medicine.\n\n\"This is just one more example of why we're very concerned that science is being suppressed at the CDC and is taking a back seat to political priorities in this administration,\" she said.\n\nWhether the combined numbers are coming from states and being republished by CDC -- or whether the CDC is misconstruing the numbers itself -- Gounder said the data are concerning. The numbers can make it seem like states have enough testing capacity and are ready to lift restrictions, when that might not be the case.\n\n\"This is pretty basic molecular biology 101 that any college student who has studied this stuff would have some basic understanding of,\" she said. \"So CDC epidemiologists know this.\"\n\nNews of the agency combining viral and antibody tests was first reported by Miami-based public radio station WLRN and in the Atlantic magazine.\n\nCDC spokeswoman Kristen Nordlund described the agency's practice to CNN on Thursday and confirmed it the next day.\n\n\"Initially, when CDC launched its website and its laboratory test reporting, viral testing (tests for current infection) were far more commonly used nationwide than serology testing (tests for past infection),\" she said in an email. \"Now that serology testing is more widely available, CDC is working to differentiate those tests from the viral tests and will report this information, differentiated by test type, publicly on our COVID Data Tracker website in the coming weeks.\"\n\nTwo very different types of coronavirus tests\n\nViral tests, or diagnostic tests, are able to identify current infections. Often called PCR or antigen tests, they look for signs of active infection. A positive test result means someone is potentially contagious -- although some tests have accuracy problems.\n\nAntibody tests, in contrast, identify whether someone has been infected by the virus in the past, not whether they're currently infected. As the CDC states on its website: \"Antibody tests should not be used to diagnose someone as being currently sick with COVID-19.\"\n\nCurrently, the CDC says that about 12.9 million tests have been reported in the US, although it cautions that not all tests are reported to the agency. Still, data from independent labs suggests that a substantial number of tests conducted in the US are antibody tests.\n\nQuest Diagnostics said on Monday that it had performed about 1 million antibody tests. LabCorp, another clinical laboratory, said it has performed more than 700,000 as of Friday.\n\nBoth companies say they have far greater capacity to perform antibody tests than viral tests.\n\nQuest said it can run 70,000 viral tests per day, compared to 200,000 antibody tests. LabCorp says it can run more than 75,000 viral tests a day, compared to more than 200,000 antibody tests.\n\nThe difference between the tests matters, because the percent of tests that come back positive -- the so-called positivity rate -- is a critical indicator for whether states are ready to reopen. It's a sign of the progress that the country is, or isn't, making on the virus -- and antibody tests can complicate the picture.\n\nBending the curve\n\nThe White House's own reopening guidelines, for example, call for a \"[downward] trajectory of positive tests as a percent of total tests within a 14-day period (flat or increasing volume of tests).\"\n\nWhile antibody tests are useful for understanding how prevalent the virus has been -- and whether people might have some sort of immunity in the future -- they don't reflect the current state of the pandemic.\n\n\"Many states are using numbers of diagnostic tests per capita and the proportion of positive test results as key metrics for reopening decisions, so adding a whole bunch of other tests that do not measure the present state of the pandemic to the mix is unhelpful and creates confusion,\" Bill Hanage, an epidemiology professor at Harvard University's School of Public Health, told CNN.\n\n\"Fortunately, most, though not all, states are reporting these results separately, which is the data that should be used when making decisions about reopening,\" he said.\n\nSome states acknowledge mixing together the numbers\n\nContacted by CNN, public health officials in most states said they haven't combined numbers from antibody and diagnostic tests. But 11 states reported mixing the numbers together at some point.\n\nColorado, Delaware, Georgia, Maine, Mississippi, Missouri, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Texas, Vermont and Virginia have all done so, but some states have stopped the practice.\n\nOfficials in Virginia and Vermont said they've fixed the issue. New Hampshire said it only reported the combined numbers for a day, and Colorado said it did so for about a week. Maine now separates out its numbers as well.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nTexas said it will be separating the numbers this week, and Georgia says it's working to provide greater transparency.

Those who have them would be issued certificates to roam and restart economies -- so the vulnerable can stay home.\n\nBut the World Health Organization and other experts say that's a terrible idea.\n\n\"So many flaws that it is hard to know where to begin,\" molecular biologist Natalie Kofler, founder of the global initiative Editing Nature, and Canadian bioethicist Fran\u00e7oise Baylis, said in a commentary published in Nature.\n\nThey listed reasons why they think it's unworkable and unfair:\n\nSo many unknowns: For starters, they wrote, it's not clear whether people develop any kind of lasting immunity after a coronavirus infection. The World Health Organization has warned governments against issuing immunity passports, saying there's no evidence people who have recovered from Covid-19 are protected from a second coronavirus infection.\n\nThe tests can't be trusted: Then there's the fact that while antibody tests are crucial in determining past exposure to coronavirus, Then there's the fact that while antibody tests are crucial in determining past exposure to coronavirus, not all available antibody tests are reliable. Some antibody tests had high rates of false positives in screenings performed by a consortium of California laboratories. A false positive means someone would be told they'd been previously exposed to coronavirus when they had not.\n\nNor are they available for everyone: There aren't enough tests for everyone who needs them. In the US, more than 1.5 million people have tested positive for coronavirus. The current calculation is almost certainly an There aren't enough tests for everyone who needs them. In the US, more than 1.5 million people have tested positive for coronavirus. The current calculation is almost certainly an undercount, said Dr. Peter Hotez, professor at Baylor College of Medicine.\n\nThere are not enough survivors: If only coronavirus survivors are allowed to contribute to the economy, there won't be enough manpower to keep it humming. \"Low disease prevalence combined with limited testing capacity, not to mention highly unreliable tests, means that only a small fraction of any population would be certified as free to work,\" they wrote.\n\nPrivacy's a concern: There's also the issue of privacy. Ethically, they argued, monitoring erodes privacy.\n\nSo is marginalization: Monitoring people to see who's immune would affect already marginalized groups. We've already seen this during this pandemic when more blacks and Hispanics were arrested for violating physical distancing laws in New York. \"With increased monitoring comes increased policing, and with it higher risks of profiling and potential harms to racial, sexual, religious or other minority groups,\" they wrote.\n\nAnd labeling, too: It'll create even more divisions. \"Labeling people on the basis of their Covid-19 status would create a new measure by which to divide the 'haves' and the 'have-nots,\" they added.\n\nMore discrimination: New forms of discrimination could emerge as any program for certifying immunity could be expanded to include other forms of personal health data. \"The immunity passports of today could become the all-encompassing biological passports of tomorrow,\" they wrote.\n\nWillful infections: Finally, immunity passports could encourage people to get infected on purpose. \"If access to certain social and economic liberties is given only to people who have recovered from Covid-19, then immunity passports could incentivize healthy, non-immune individuals to willfully seek out infection \u2014 putting themselves and others at risk,\" they wrote.\n\nBetter approaches include old-fashioned identification and tracing of infected people and their contacts and development of a vaccine, Kofler and Baylis argued.", "link": "https://us.cnn.com/2020/05/22/health/immunity-passport-coronavirus/index.html", "published": "2020-05-22T00:00:00", "author": ["Faith Karimi"]}, {"title": "We will be seeing more of the scientists from the White House coronavirus task force soon, Fauci says", "text": "(CNN) The public will be seeing more of Dr. Anthony Fauci, the popular director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.\n\n\"I think you're going to probably be seeing a little bit more of me and my colleagues,\" Fauci, a member of the White House coronavirus task force, said on CNN's Global Town Hall Thursday.\n\n\"We've been talking with the communications people, and they realize we need to get some of this information out, particularly some of the scientific issues for which I'm predominantly responsible for, so hopefully we'll be seeing more of us, will get the opportunity to talk to you.\"\n\nFauci's appearances on TV have been limited in the last few weeks as the White House has increased the pressure on the nation's governors to open up their states economies from stay-at-home orders meant to fight the spread of the novel coronavirus.

A report released earlier this month by the Well Being Trust predicted as many as 75,000 American's could die because of drug or alcohol misuse and suicide as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n\"We've seen unemployment rates go higher than what we were anticipating, which means that some of the estimates on those deaths could actually increase substantially,\" Ben Miller, a psychologist and the chief strategy officer for the Well Being Trust, told CNN.\n\n\"But what makes it all different and why I think that people do need to be paying attention to this is that the social issues, the sheltering in place, the isolation, the loneliness -- those are major, major risk factors for people not doing well psychologically, as well as potential premature mortality due to suicide or overdose,\" Miller said.\n\nSome opioid deaths down, other drug overdoses up\n\nThe big difference in overall deaths of despair in 2018 compared to the year before, the researchers said, was the lower numbers of overdose deaths involving prescription opioids, such as oxycodone and hydrocodone, and to a lesser extent heroin, which were down by 2%.\n\n\"I think the bright spot in the report is that we can see that some strategies that our nation has pursued around opioids might actually be working for some communities,\" Miller said.\n\nThe study, which analyzed numbers from the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention since 1999, also found that while some drug-related deaths declined for the first time in a decade, including for whites and those between 18 and 54 years old, deaths from other drugs increased.\n\nDrilling down into the report reveals some troubling trends. The death rate overall for synthetic opioids, such as fentanyl and carfentanil, for example, was up by 10% in 2018 to 14 deaths per 100,000 compared to 3.5 deaths per 100,000 in 2013. Deaths involving cocaine, methamphetamine, ecstasy and other prescription stimulants were also higher.\n\nMinority deaths of despair on the rise\n\nAlso troubling, whites were the only racial group that saw a decrease in overall deaths from drug overdoses in 2018 -- by 6% or 23.3 per 100,000. The numbers were worse than the year before for Native Americans, African Americans, Asians and Latinos, who all experienced increases in drug overdose deaths, the report found, with blacks and native Americans experiencing the largest rise.\n\n\"Blacks now have higher synthetic opioid overdose rates (10.7 per 100,000), cocaine overdose rates (8.8 per 100,000) and nearly the same overall drug-induced death rate (21.8 per 100,000) as whites, after decades of having substantially lower rates,\" the report read.\n\n\"The ongoing structural inequalities in this country are so profound that I think that this report also does call out those disparities that have been here for a long time, and they're not getting any better. And, so, we have to think beyond one size fits all for providing meaningful solutions for communities that really are having major problems around this,\" Miller said.\n\nThe report also revealed that overall drug-related deaths increased at the highest rate among Asian Americans from 2017 to 2018, increasing by 6% to 4.2 deaths per 100,000, and among Native Americans these deaths were up 5% in 2018. Suicide rates also increased the most among Native Americans and Latinos.\n\n\"These data are a clarion call to action,\" John Auerbach, president and CEO of Trust for America's Health, said in a statement. \"We know what works to address deaths of despair, but progress has been uneven and death rates continue to climb, with communities of color experiencing higher rates of increases in drug-induced and alcohol deaths.\"\n\nStill too many preventable deaths\n\nMiller said the US responded to the broader opioid epidemic that has been gripping parts of the country for the past decade and it's reflected in this report, but the broader addiction crisis has not been addressed in the same way.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n\"It was only about opioids because a lot of those strategies have worked but they have not necessarily done as much as they could have done to address issues across the broader community,\" he said.\n\n\"Arguably any death due to a preventable cause is a death that we should have done something about,\" he added. \"I think that the most important findings from this study is that 150,000, while it wasn't substantially more than the previous year, it is still too many.\n\nThe report makes recommendations for combating deaths of despair, including promoting racial equality, reducing risk factors, such as violence, unstable housing and discrimination, and increasing access to health care.", "link": "https://us.cnn.com/2020/05/21/health/drug-overdose-deaths-covid-19-trnd/index.html", "published": "2020-05-21T00:00:00", "author": ["Shellin Erdman"]}, {"title": "Conjoined Twins Fast Facts", "text": "Conjoined twins are physically connected to one another at some point on their bodies.\n\nAbout 70% of conjoined twins are female.\n\nConjoined twins are identical - they are the same sex.\n\nThe form of conjoined twinning refers to the point where the twins are joined.

As the lockdown continues, experts are preparing for a surge in domestic violence and child abuse cases. CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta speaks to Ariel Zwang, CEO of Safe Horizon, one of the country's largest victim service organizations, about what we can all do to help.\n\nIf you need help, call the National Domestic Violence Hotline at 1-800-799-SAFE or visit its website at thehotline.org\n\nYou can listen on your favorite podcast app or read the transcript below.\n\nWe've heard stories where survivors are saying my relationship was emotionally abusive, but it became physically abusive last night. We've heard stories from women whose partners were coming home and coughing on them and telling them that they were infecting them with the coronavirus.\n\nDr. Sanjay Gupta: That was Katie Ray-Jones, the head of the National Domestic Violence Hotline.\n\nFor most of us, staying at home has been the safest way to protect ourselves from the coronavirus.\n\nBut for others, home can be a dangerous place, worrying experts about what is happening behind closed doors.\n\nSo what do we really know? And what can we do to help those who may be isolated and afraid?\n\nIn the past, we have seen increases in domestic violence during times of crisis and stress.\n\nJames Gagliano, CNN Law Enforcement Analyst: We've seen spikes in 2008 during the economic crisis.\n\nGupta: James Gagliano is a former FBI agent and CNN's law enforcement analyst. He says this pandemic is putting victims in a particularly vulnerable situation.\n\nGagliano: We've seen spikes during national disasters like, say, Hurricane Katrina or Hurricane Sandy. We've also seen it during times of the Super Bowl, major sporting events. And look, correlation doesn't always equal causation here, but there is a lot of factors at play, and one of them is these victims are trapped in a co-habitation situation with the abuser.\n\nGupta: As stay-at-home orders went into effect in March, several cities across the United States reported As stay-at-home orders went into effect in March, several cities across the United States reported a steep increase in domestic violence calls as compared to last year.\n\nCities like Seattle, Portland and Boston have all reported increases in calls to hotlines, or reports or arrests related to domestic violence. In April, Chicago city officials told CNN the Illinois Domestic Violence Hotline saw the highest daily call volume in its 20-year history.\n\nMeanwhile, in other parts of the country, calls to domestic abuse hotlines and reports to law enforcement have stayed flat or even declined. Experts worry that victims stuck at home with their abusers may not know how to get help.\n\nOne group that is working to assist victims of domestic violence is Safe Horizon. Based in New York City, they are one of the largest victim service organizations in the country.\n\nAriel Zwang CEO, Safe Horizon: We work with victims of all crime and abuse, and that includes family violence, domestic violence, child abuse, sexual assault, human trafficking, elder abuse. And we help people to heal and rebuild their lives.\n\nGupta: Ariel Zwang is the CEO of Safe Horizon.\n\nI started by asking her what she had been hearing from people who need help during this pandemic.\n\nZwang: So when nobody's supposed to be out and about, the choice to leave a situation or leave home is definitely complicated by concerns about getting the virus. Others can include, let's say the victim is someone that had not been economically dependent on the abuser, but now they've lost their job. So maybe that's an economic dependence that has now begun.\n\nGupta: Are there particular signs of an abusive situation?\n\nZwang: If that person doesn't seem to have the freedom to go where and when they want. Seems to have to account for every dollar or every place they go. Seems to be separated from loving relationships that used to be important to them.\n\nIn the relationship, you may experience all of those things and also threats. And then, of course, every form of physical violence that people experience. But if someone is hurting you, physically, choking you, spitting on you, you absolutely have a right to seek help and to not expect that that behavior is normal.\n\nGupta: I imagine that the problem has worsened during this pandemic of both intimate partner violence, child abuse. But I wonder, do you know for sure? I mean, just because the reporting of this, I imagine, is part of the challenge as well, right?\n\nZwang: The story on reporting is complicated. In the first month of the stay-at-home orders here in New York, calls to our hotline were down. That's for a couple of reasons. One, people just prioritizing their, their health.\n\nBut another is an assumption that help wasn't available. And that is tragic because help is available. Our hotline is functioning. The National Domestic Violence Hotline is functioning. Police are responding to calls. We're able to provide a tremendous range of services, virtually.\n\nAnd as the word has gotten out about that, our calls have increased.\n\nChild abuse is a different matter because those reports come from teachers who are mandated reporters and doctors. Those reports are down by 75 percent over the prior period. And that is heartbreaking and tragic because the abuse cannot be down by 75 percent. It means that teachers that would normally see something and be concerned about it are not able to see that over remote learning.\n\nGupta: Let me ask you, though, Ariel. Short of opening up, are there other things that can be done to address this issue specifically with child abuse?\n\nZwang: We've done research over the years about bystanders to child abuse. People who may suspect there's something abusive happening in a family. And overwhelmingly, members of the public say, I wouldn't want to report that because I might be wrong. What if I'm wrong and it's really none of my business? And my response to that is, what if you're not wrong? What if you're right?\n\nAnd so I would say if anyone listening to this podcast has a nagging suspicion that, that a child is not being treated right in their home, find out where in your state you can call it in.\n\nGupta: It just strikes me from a pragmatic sense that it might be challenging if you're in an apartment, you know, with people and you're trying to seek help, but you're worried about stigma even within your own living situation or privacy concerns.\n\nWhat do you recommend for someone who says, I want to get help, but you know frankly, I got someone listening in the next room, every time I try and get on the call or seek help?\n\nZwang: I recommend chat. It can be much more private. And there are many mental health services available over chat. A large part of what we do with victims of domestic violence is safety planning. What can that particular person do to be safer? With sheltering at home, that's become much more complicated because safety plans often would include something like I can spend the night at my mother's if I see certain signs of behavior that are worrisome. That sort of thing may not be an option now.\n\nBut options that can still work for this time might be a code word that your child knows, that if I say a certain word, the child should call 911. It might be something like a neighbor you know when I put the shade up in the bathroom or put a plant in the window, the neighbor knows that you're in distress and to keep an ear out and to call the police.\n\nGupta: And as you pointed out, it's about giving people help.\n\nZwang: Yes, first and foremost, if you imagine or think about what it might be like or what it must be like to be a child or to be an adult trapped in a situation where you feel fear every minute of the day. And you could help that person. Think of what that would mean.\n\nGupta: Victims of domestic abuse faced significant challenges even before the pandemic. But Ariel wants people to know that organizations like Safe Horizon can help, and they can do it discreetly.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nZwang: The Safe Horizon Hotline, 1-800-621-HOPE, is the front door for all of the services that we offer.

The ALK gene makes a protein called anaplastic lymphoma kinase, which is involved in cell growth.\n\nThey pinpointed the variant after looking at DNA samples and clinical data of more than 47,000 healthy people in Estonia between the ages of 20 and 44.\n\n\"The Estonia biobank is very unique in its detail,\" said senior author Josef Penninger, a professor in the department of medical genetics and the director of the Life Sciences Institute at the University of British Columbia.\n\n\"We looked at the genetic maps of people with a BMI [body mass index] below 18 and compared them with those of people of normal weight and found the [genetic variant] that correlated with being super skinny,\" Penninger said.\n\nThe team then examined how the ALK gene functions in mice and flies.\n\nStephen O'Rahilly, professor and head of the department of clinical biochemistry and the director of the metabolic diseases unit at the University of Cambridge, said the research was \"not definitive\" but \"very interesting.\"\n\nO'Rahilly, who wasn't involved in the study, added that \"it certainly increases interest in ALK7 inhibition as a therapeutic strategy for the treatment of obesity.\"\n\nThinner flies and mice\n\nScientists already know that a mutated form of the ALK gene and protein can drive the development of cancer tumors, the study said. Mutated forms of the gene and protein have been found in non-small cell lung cancer, anaplastic large cell lymphoma and neuroblastoma, a brain cancer.\n\nThis new finding suggested a different mutation of the gene may play a role in thinness and resistance to gaining weight. To test this, the scientists conducted experiments on flies and mice and found that deleting this gene resulted in thinner versions of those flies and mice.\n\n\"We gave the mice (what amounted to) a McDonald's diet. The normal mice got obese and the ones without ALK remained skinny,\" Penninger said.\n\nThe team's mouse studies also suggested that the ALK gene instructs fat tissues to burn more fat from food.\n\nO'Rahilly described the animal studies as \"well done\" but noted that the genetic variation that was associated with lower body mass index in the Estonia biobank was \"modest\" and not as robust as many experts in the field would accept as \"definitive.\"\n\nHowever, he said that previous studies in much larger populations have shown a suggestive, but not strong, signal of an association with body weight in that area of the genome, and it was unlikely that the variation would be unique to Estonians.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nPenninger said that treatments targeting the gene might help scientists fight obesity in the future.\n\n\"If you think about it, it's realistic that we could shut down ALK and reduce ALK function to see if we did stay skinny,\" Penninger said.\n\n\"ALK inhibitors are used in cancer treatments already.

His latest post, \"The Risks \u2014 Know Them \u2014 Avoid Them,\" went viral and gained more than 13 million views in about a week.\n\nThe explainer illustrated how breathing versus talking loudly versus sneezing can put out different amounts of respiratory droplets in the air.\n\n\"A big part of me writing these posts is just to give some tangible advice to friends, family, about what risks they should really be worrying about and wasting mental energy on,\" he told CNN's John Berman on \"New Day.\"\n\n\"Not a lot of my friends know what we should be doing now in this brave new world,\" Bromage said.\n\n\"I was trying to give them the tools they need to know if you end up indoors \u2014 which we're going to \u2014 in an environment where there seems like there's a lot of people, and it just doesn't feel right, then that's a situation that you should avoid.

His responses are lightly edited for clarity.\n\nCNN: Why are grocery stores, bike riders and inconsiderate runners less of a concern when compared to sharing enclosed spaces like an office or Why are grocery stores, bike riders and inconsiderate runners less of a concern when compared to sharing enclosed spaces like an office or restaurant\n\nBromage: It comes down to the concentration of the virus in the air and the length of exposure. In larger spaces with better ventilation or outdoors, the concentration of the virus can be diluted in the larger volume of the air. The lower the virus burden in the air, the longer you can be in that environment before receiving an infectious dose.\n\nCNN: What is the difference between sneezing, talking loudly and singing in terms of virus transmission?\n\nBromage: Respiratory droplet emission follows this sequence. Talking loudly emits a lesser amount of droplets than singing. Sneezing emits the most. The more force by which a sound leaves your mouth, the more respiratory particles are emitted, and they travel a further distance.\n\nCNN: If people have a cold or other virus, should they stay away from everyone as if they had Covid-19?\n\nBromage: If Covid-19 is prevalent in your area and you have symptoms in the Covid-19 spectrum, you need to treat your sickness as Covid-19. If you are sick, you should stay home and you should limit interactions with household members.\n\nCNN: As states reopen, where can people go and where should they reconsider going?\n\nBromage: People should go to any outdoor space with ample room for social distancing, such as beaches, parks and trails. However, they should limit their time in outdoor spaces where social distancing can't be maintained most of the time \u2014 any crowded spot, such as the protests we have been seeing lately.\n\nPeople should also limit how much time they spend in any indoor spaces with poor air exchange and lots of people with no effective ability to social distance. I hope when we reopen, none of these places will exist, and guidelines would have been put in place to stop it from occurring. I believe that almost every business can engineer their space to ensure that they limit numbers of people at one time to a number that is determined by air exchange and size of their facility.\n\nCNN: What steps are you taking to keep safe in your home and community?\n\nBromage: We repeatedly remind ourselves to wash our hands and not to touch our faces! If we go grocery shopping or hiking on a local trail, we wash our hands immediately after coming back to the house. We open packages in the garage and leave packaging outside.\n\nFor the groceries that come in plastic packaging that will be refrigerated or frozen, we wipe down the packaging using disinfectant wipes. We allow the packaging to dry before we put those items into the fridge or freezer. All pantry items are just put away as usual.\n\nWe wear masks in public where we can't socially distance all the time. We have higher-quality masks for environments where we linger, like the grocery store or work. And we have lower-quality masks for short interaction. We use a neck sleeve or T-shirt mask to pull up in places like a forest trail where we might have to pass within 6 feet of other people.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nCNN: What do you wish people would take away from your post?\n\nBromage: With knowledge, you can limit your risk of infection and so you can take power away from the fear of the virus.

But the data is still pretty limited, and what scientists know about these infections is based on a handful of case reports.\n\nThe CDC said babies are most likely exposed to the virus through respiratory droplets from their mom or from other caregivers or visitors. There are some limited reports that they may be exposed to the virus right before or even during labor, but the science on that is still unclear, the federal agency said.\n\nSince there is still limited information about how frequently these cases occur, doctors should presume such newborns have an infection.

A pandemic changed that.\n\nNow, the most musical words we hear are that we're \"bringing a sense of reassurance and normalcy\" to cable news' youngest audience. It sounds a lot more muted, but its significance is amplified by what school systems have had to endure in the semester that no one saw coming\n\nA school year turned upside down\n\nEverything envisioned by students, ranging from middle schoolers to college undergraduates (who constitute the core of our audience) was upended by lockdowns, shutdowns and cancellations.\n\nAdministrators became architects of educational reconstruction. Teachers became online instructors, endurance coaches and fireside chatters. And students became founts of perseverance.\n\nIt's not a trade that many would have made for a normal school year. But it's a Herculean effort to patch up the shredded wheel of learning , and it will enshrine the graduating Class of 2020 as the one that gave up its senior privileges in exchange for a place in history.\n\nTo our staff at CNN 10 (which CNN Student News became in 2017), it was more of an exercise in logistics than an education-rocking earthquake.\n\nProducing CNN 10 from home\n\nFor the past three months, we've been working through the challenges of producing our 10-minute show from different locations. Our background looks a lot more like my bookshelf than our CNN Center studio. Our producers have had to reconfigure their workflow to accommodate less-powerful and more buggy hardware, and our ability to personally interact with our multimillion-member audience in real life has evaporated.\n\nBut the first week we were sent home, we started getting feedback that made it worthwhile. Our social and email channels lit up with teachers saying they were grateful we were still producing the show \u2014 and that they loved the fact that I was anchoring from home.\n\nIt gives students a sense that we're all being impacted by this pandemic, they told me. It makes the program feel warmer to them as they sit on the couch watching the show that I'm sitting on the couch anchoring.\n\nWe've also been told that CNN 10 has given students a sense of normalcy \u2014 something many teenagers crave in times that don't fit anyone's sense of normal.

They were preparing to leave Lebanon amid fears of a major coronavirus outbreak there, and tried to convince her to do the same.\n\nBut the 28-year-old humanitarian consultant from Montana decided to stay. After Lebanon closed its borders on March 19 to stem the spread of the global pandemic, she began furnishing her rooftop terrace. Her time in Beirut, she realized, would be indefinite.\n\n\"I made that decision for a combination of personal reasons and calculations about the virus that we're all making,\" says Fuglei. \"I think that I am probably safer here.\"\n\nIt's a decision that several US citizens in Beirut who CNN spoke to have echoed, citing skyrocketing cases in the US . When the US government last week said it would fly its citizens and permanent residents to the US on a chartered flight for $2,500 per person, some Americans took to Twitter to publicly decline the offer.\n\n\"And no, Mom, I'm not going,\" Beirut-based freelance journalist Abby Sewell wrote in a tweet about the US embassy announcement.\n\nResponding to her tweet, a Lebanese journalist said: \"For once I'm like no America is not safer than here.\" Sewell's mother, Meg Sewell, replied: \"Actually, for the moment I might have to agree.\"\n\nSewell tells CNN she never considered taking the US embassy's offer.\n\n\"From everything I'm reading, the situation is worse in the US, in terms of the number of cases, prevention measures or lack thereof, and how overburdened the health system is,\" she says.\n\n\"Also, since I've been living overseas for years, I don't have health insurance in the US now, so if I did go back and then got sick, I would be looking at paying thousands of dollars out of pocket.\"\n\nLebanese soldiers, wearing protective equipment, stand guard at Beirut international airport on April 5, ahead of the arrival of returning nationals.\n\nOn the morning of April 5, the US embassy flew 95 US citizens out of Lebanon, according to a US State Department official. It is estimated that thousands of Americans live in Lebanon -- many of whom also hold Lebanese citizenship.\n\n\"The Department of State has no greater priority than the safety and security of US citizens overseas,\" the official told CNN. \"We are rising to meet the historic challenge posed by the Covid-19 pandemic, every day, all over the world.\"\n\nWhen asked about Americans suggesting that Beirut is, for once, safer than the US, the official declined to comment.\n\nA rapid outbreak back home\n\nDaryn Howland, 27, is hunkered down in her Beirut apartment, diving into her work as a consultant. \"My plan is to stay here for the indefinite future,\" says the Boston native.\n\n\"The fact that things are so bad in the US means it's one of the first times where it's safer to be in Lebanon than in the US,\" Howland also echoes. \"Despite the (Lebanese political and economic) situation ... I think my odds are better here.\"\n\n\"All of my American friends here have decided to stay,\" she adds.\n\nWhen the first novel coronavirus case was reported in Lebanon on February 21, the country was already awash with crises.\n\nNationwide protests erupted against the country's political elite last October, toppling the government of former Prime Minister Saad Hariri and deepening a political crisis. Already under increasing pressure, the country's currency tanked. Last month, Beirut announced its first ever debt default.\n\nUnder widespread pressure from activists and media, the freshly-minted government of Prime Minister Hassan Diab vowed not to take any chances with the virus, despite the toll any measures might take on the already troubled economy.\n\nSanitary workers disinfect the desks and chairs of the Lebanese Parliament on March 10.\n\nEight days after that first case, on February 29, the country closed its schools and universities. On March 6, it shuttered restaurants and cafes, ahead of several western European countries, such as Italy, in enforcing such a measure. The government then announced a lockdown on March 15.\n\nIn recent weeks, the spread of the coronavirus in Lebanon has slowed, according to the World Health Organization's Lebanon office. Medical professionals have offered cautious praise for the country's relatively early steps to enforce the lockdown.\n\n\"We're not at a stage where we have to decide who gets a ventilator and who doesn't. That is because we are staying at home and the borders are closed,\" tweeted Dr. Firass Abiad, head of the government's Rafik Hariri University Hospital, which has been dealing with the majority of coronavirus cases in Beirut. His tweet linked to a New York Times opinion piece about ventilator shortages in the US.\n\nAs of April 9, there are more than 430,000 Covid-19 cases and 14,000 deaths in the US, with 576 cases and 19 fatalities in Lebanon, according to Johns Hopkins University figures.\n\nJust under 12,000 tests for coronavirus have been carried out so far in Lebanon. That equates to around 0.1% of the population (by contrast, roughly 0.3% of the population in Britain, and 1.1% of the population of Germany have been tested). As a result, the ministry of public health believes it is underestimating the scale of its outbreak. It has urged more people to get tested.\n\nLebanon's ministry of public health has vowed to boost the number of screenings to as many as 2,000 a day. It says anyone with mild to severe symptoms is entitled to be tested.\n\nIn a recent video address, Director General of the Public Health Ministry Walid Ammar blamed the social stigma around COVID-19 for low levels of screening in the country: \"If a citizen feels that your reaction will be bad, then they won't go and get tested,\" said Ammar. \"You all should be afraid of people who won't get tested because they're afraid of you. These are the people who will infect you.\"\n\nMore people are showing up for tests, but the medical sector -- which was dealt a heavy blow by the country's financial crisis -- lacks the resources to conduct mass screenings, medical professionals say.\n\nMedics say that the country's proactive lockdown measures have helped the health sector avoid the pandemonium seen in many other countries ravaged by the virus.\n\n\"The more we test, the better, but we have to realize that our resources are limited and need to use it strategically,\" tweeted Hassan Zaraket, a virologist and assistant professor at the American University of Beirut. \"If we had been missing many cases we would have explosion at ER & ICU.\"\n\nLebanese security forces stop cars at a highway checkpoint north of Beirut on April 6, as authorities implemented further measures restricting the movement of vehicles.\n\nWhile it may be too soon to say if the spread of coronavirus will continue to slow, Howland says she has taken comfort in Lebanon's strict measures. \"The government got ahead of the problem and so far (the number of cases) hasn't escalated,\" she says.\n\nThe White House's response, she argues, stands in sharp contrast with that of her crisis-ridden adopted country.\n\nUS President Donald Trump has come under fire for being slow to act in stopping the rapid spread of the disease there. The country now has the highest number of reported cases and deaths from the virus globally, and a prominent model that tracks the coronavirus in the US predicted on Wednesday that more than 60,000 people will die due to Covid-19 by August.\n\n\"Watching how Trump has handled this crisis ... it just seems that people are not really aware of what's going on and not taking the proper decisions,\" says Howland.\n\nEmployees work while wearing protective face shields and gloves at a store in the northern Lebanese city of Batroun on March 23.\n\nFears of long-term pain in Lebanon\n\nOthers believe that cash-strapped Lebanon has yet to see the worst of the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nWhen Lebanese-American Hana Murr received an email with the US embassy's offer for repatriation last week, she saw it as an opportunity to flee a deepening economic crisis.\n\n\"We've always had a weak state and we're going to get affected greatly by that as a result,\" says Murr. \"The government now has to play catch-up. They're doing a pretty decent job. I am surprised. My expectations were very low, and they've exceeded them.\"\n\nBut she adds: \"The downward spiral of the economy and the dangers that coronavirus pose make me very afraid, and I want to get out before it all comes to a head.\"\n\n\"I'm happy, heartbroken, relieved, depressed and it changes every 10 minutes,\" says Murr, hours before boarding a flight back to her home state of Florida.\n\nSpeaking from her Beirut apartment, Montana-native Fuglei says she may have been tempted to return to the US, had she had more faith in its leadership.\n\n\"To be honest, if we still had an Obama administration or any kind of confidence then maybe we (Americans in Beirut) would have felt differently,\" she says. \"They probably would have enacted something where I had a clear healthcare plan going back, or where housing was being compensated, or having a clear package of benefits that I could have come back to,\" Fuglei adds.\n\n\"I just have zero trust.\"", "link": "https://us.cnn.com/2020/04/09/middleeast/us-citizens-lebanon-coronavirus-intl/index.html", "published": "2020-04-09T00:00:00", "author": ["Tamara Qiblawi"]}, {"title": "Jamal Khashoggi's children 'pardon' father's killers, sparing them the death penalty", "text": "\"So we, the sons of the martyr Jamal Khashoggi, announce that we have pardoned (those) who killed our father,\" the family added in the statement. Muslim governments typically issue pardons on the month of Ramadan.\n\nAccording to Saudi law, a pardon from a son of a murder victim serves as a legal reprieve. Last December, five government agents convicted of Khashoggi's murder at the kingdom's Istanbul consulate in October 2018 were sentenced to death . Three other people allegedly involved in the case were given prison sentences.\n\nOverall, 11 people were put on trial for Khashoggi's murder, which sparked a global outcry and dealt a blow to the kingdom's reputation.\n\nThe families of the convicts are now liable to pay blood money to Khashoggi's family. If they can't afford to make the payment, the state can pay instead, in addition to state money already given to the family.\n\nA source last year told CNN that the family received millions of US dollars in cash and assets as compensation for the killing. Khashoggi's sons denied that they received a blood money settlement from the Saudi government.\n\n'Parody of justice'\n\nThe United Nations rapporteur for extrajudicial executions, Agnes Callamard , who led a high-profile investigation into Khashoggi's murder, called the family pardon \"the final act of the parody of justice.\"\n\n\"Saudi Arabia has repeatedly proven it will not deliver justice for Jamal Khashoggi. This is the last piece to the Saudi impunity puzzle, the final act of the parody of justice played in front of a global audience. The killers will walk free. Exonerated,\" Callamard said in a tweet on Friday following the family's announcement.\n\nKhashoggi's fiance\u00e9e, Hatice Cengiz, also tweeted her disapproval of the pardon: \"The killers came from Saudi with premeditation to lure, ambush and kill him. Nobody has the right to pardon the killers, We will not pardon the killers nor those who ordered the killing.\"\n\n\"Jamal Khashoggi became an international symbol bigger than any of us, admired and loved. His ambush and heinous murder does not have a [statute] of limitations and no one has the right to pardon his killers. I and others will not stop until we get justice for Jamal.\"\n\nIn a report last year, Callamard concluded that Saudi Arabia was responsible under international law for the \"deliberate, premeditated execution\" and called for an investigation into the role of the Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, saying there was \"credible evidence meriting further investigation by a proper authority\" as to whether the \"threshold of criminal responsibility has been met.\"", "link": "https://us.cnn.com/2020/05/22/middleeast/khashoggi-children-pardon-saudi-intl/index.html", "published": "2020-05-22T00:00:00", "author": ["Mohammed Tawfeeq", "Jomana Karadsheh", "Tamara Qiblawi", "Nic Robertson"]}, {"title": "Keeping shoppers safe at one of the world's busiest malls", "text": "CNN's series often carry sponsorship originating from the countries and regions we profile.

Greece has announced plans to open malls on June 1.\n\nElsewhere in the UAE, the neighboring emirates of Sharjah and Abu Dhabi have cautiously allowed malls to reopen.

After the coronavirus started to spread this year, his employer suspended operations, leaving him in limbo. Commercial flights in the UAE were grounded, India went into lockdown on March 24, and Singh stopped receiving an income.\n\n\"For the past two months, we have been sitting in the room and our company was giving us a salary, but now they are saying that they cannot give us a salary and we should buy a ticket to go home, but where should we buy the ticket?\" the 44-year-old told CNN.\n\nSingh is one of hundreds of thousands of migrant workers across the Gulf's Arab countries who are contending with stripped livelihoods, overcrowded camps and no easy path to repatriation, Amnesty International, Migrant-Rights.org and Business & Human Rights Resource Centre said.\n\nLaborers are also especially vulnerable to the virus, these rights groups say, and the compounds they're restricted to are considered hotbeds of the pandemic in the region.\n\nWith limited options for repatriation, and with no salary, hundreds of thousands of migrant workers in the Gulf are running out of options.\n\nSlow repatriations\n\nIn one labor camp on the outskirts of Dubai, hundreds of recently unemployed workers spend their days walking around the yard with their friends concocting plans to go home.\n\n\"I have not received the salary for the previous month ... they gave 150 Rupees (around $2) for food and told us to manage,\" said one construction worker who CNN agreed to not identify due to his fear of punishment by his previous employer.\n\n\"We don't have money to eat. Sometimes the company gives money. Sometimes they give a partial amount.

Around 200,000 Indian nationals in the UAE have registered for repatriation, according to the Indian embassy, and so far more than 700 have been returned. Over 5,000 are set to be repatriated from the Gulf this week.\n\nThe embassy tweeted that Indians will foot the bill of their repatriation, presenting yet another obstacle to stranded migrant workers.\n\nSome of the embassies representing the largely South and East Asian laborers in the UAE have repatriated a handful of the stranded nationals.

Wearing a double layered headscarf, she settles into a blue armchair. She has until the afternoon to trim the spines off the wild plant for her customers to cook.\n\n\"We work on the akoub (gundelia) so that we can live,\" says Um Ahmad, using a pseudonym.\n\nWhen visitors walk into her dark, cavernous room to meet her, she doesn't even look up. A drama series blasts from an old TV.\n\n\"I get paid 10,000 liras for five kilograms of this,\" she mumbles, peeling the stems of the spiny plant with a small curved knife. Because the Lebanese lira is in free-fall , her payment is worth just over $2.\n\n\"The akoub doesn't even come every day,\" says Um Ahmad, never meeting her guests' eyes.\n\nUm Ahmad lives beneath a centuries-old souk (or marketplace) in Lebanon's northern city of Tripoli.\n\nOutside, the city roils with violent demonstrations, known as the \"hunger protest.\" These started just as Lebanon was loosening its coronavirus lockdown, and beginning to contend with poor living conditions exacerbated by the near shutdown of the economy.\n\nNightly confrontations between demonstrators and the Lebanese army have rocked Tripoli over the last week, turning it into the epicenter of the country's renewed uprising against its political elite.\n\nProtests against Lebanon's political class , which has ruled the country since its civil war and is widely accused of corruption, engulfed its main urban centers in late 2019. At the time, tens of thousands of Tripoli's protesters flocked onto the streets. The city was dubbed \"the bride of the revolution,\" both because of its energetic protests and because it was believed to have borne the brunt of political corruption.\n\nTripoli is the poorest city in Lebanon, despite being home to some of its most high-profile billionaires. A slum stretches across the banks of the city's Abu Ali river, just minutes from pockets of extravagant wealth. The income disparity was always stark, but these days, Tripoli's locals say it is unbearable.\n\n\"No one has trust in the banks. No one has trust in the state. There's injustice, there's shame and there's oppression,\" says Ahmad Aich, who runs a shoe stand.\n\nAich's voice rises to a crescendo. As with many Tripoli natives, the conversation begins with the soft tones of a city folk known for their kindness to strangers, but quickly turns into a tirade about living conditions.\n\n\"The solution is for the army chief to round up all the politicians who robbed this country and to put them in jail,\" says Aich. \"They pillaged the country and killed it and killed its people.\"\n\nCalls for the army to deliver justice echo across Tripoli even as demonstrators hurl stones, fireworks and Molotov cocktails at the armed forces. The military has responded with brute force. It has fired tear gas and rubber bullets, and, in some instances, live fire, at protesters, killing one on Monday and wounding dozens over the last week.\n\n\"The army are our brothers. What we want is for them to join us, take the politicians from their houses, and throw them in the garbage dump,\" says protester Ghassan, a 24-year-old handyman and a father-to-be who asked not to disclose his full name for security reasons.\n\n\"If your child is hungry, you will eat your rulers to feed your children,\" he adds.\n\nLebanese Prime Minister Hassan Diab has called the demonstrations \"natural\" given growing economic hardship, but has accused rioters of infiltrating the protests in order to cause unrest. The Lebanese army also acknowledged the right to \"freedom of expression\" and cast suspicion on violent protesters. It said it would launch an investigation into Monday's death.\n\nRising poverty\n\nLebanon's economy has taken a nose dive since last year. Before an uprising gripped the country in October 2019, the World Bank said nearly one third of the population was living under the poverty line. Earlier this year, the bank updated that statistic to 45% for the year 2020. Now, after government measures designed to slow the spread of the coronavirus halted the economy, Lebanon's government believes up to 75% of the country needs aid\n\nIt is a dramatic drop in living standards for a country which in 2018 had the highest GDP per capita among the Arab world's non-oil producing nations.\n\nIn recent weeks, the Lebanese lira lost over half its value, hurting both merchants and consumers. Small shop owners are struggling to secure supplies, and the country's growing legions of poor people can't afford to buy them.\n\nIn Tripoli, many people say that most staple goods have at least doubled in price, making the working class increasingly reliant on aid from charities.\n\nAmer El-Deek, 30, used to own a shoe stand and made ends meet with a daily income of $10. Now, he says, all he can do is beg and rely on food packages from an Islamic charity.\n\n\"We don't know how we're even alive,\" says Deek, the father of a six-year-old. \"I now go to sleep and think: God, I hope I don't wake up. I hope I die tomorrow.\"\n\n'Hunger protests'\n\nWhen the \"hunger protests\" kicked off last week, few were surprised. \"I see that a revolution of the hungry is coming,\" Hezbollah-backed MP and former intelligence chief Jamil El-Sayyed tweeted in December.\n\nThe uprising's largely peaceful protests turned violent after a nearly two-month respite due to coronavirus. In Tripoli, protesters staged large demonstrations outside politicians' homes vowing to avenge their alleged corruption. Nearly every bank branch in the city has been damaged by the protests, with demonstrators voicing their fury at the banking sector's discretionary capital controls.\n\nOn any given work day, long queues of people begging to withdraw their cash can be seen outside bank branches. Lebanese authorities have resisted calls to formalize capital controls, raising suspicions that the economic elite in Lebanon have been exercising their influence to remove their funds from the country, while small depositors are largely denied access to their life savings.\n\nYoung and old head to Tripoli's protest sites after Ramadan's Taraweeh prayers, which are performed after the fast is broken during the holy month.\n\nThey arrive on mopeds, gather in crowds and yell protest chants. Most do not wear face masks, and no one is observing government-mandated social distancing rules. That's because most of the people on Tripoli's streets believe that coronavirus doesn't exist here.\n\nThe lockdown has stoked resentment, fueled rumors of a government conspiracy to further impoverish the poor and ultimately ignited the protests.\n\n\"We don't have coronavirus here in Tripoli. Coronavirus is a heresy. (The politicians) made it up,\" says one city native, Marwan el-Zahed.\n\n\"What do I care about coronavirus,\" says another Tripolitan, Ahmad Abou Abdallah. \"(The politicians) are worse than coronavirus. They are dirtier than coronavirus. They are making people hungry. Doesn't that make them worse than the virus?\"\n\nFourteen cases of the coronavirus have been reported so far in Tripoli. In total, Lebanon has had 740 confirmed cases of the virus and 24 deaths. It has received some credit for a largely successful bid to contain the virus.\n\nUnderground, Um Ahmad is too busy working on her gundelia to talk politics. She has also lapsed into disillusionment.\n\n\"My situation is just as you see it,\" she says, gesturing to her home's conditions. \"Sometimes I empty the pulp of zucchini for people.

But the restrictions have further exacerbated the country's deep and long-running financial crisis\n\nSince a popular uprising gripped the country late in 2019, its currency has dropped and it defaulted on its debt for the first time. Now, after nearly two months of lockdown, food prices are soaring and the Lebanese lira is in free-fall.\n\nPrior to the Covid-19 outbreak, the World Bank projected that 45% of people in Lebanon would be below the poverty line in 2020. Now, the government believes that up to 75% of people are in need of aid, Social Affairs Minister Ramzi Musharrafieh told CNN.\n\n\"We are hungry,\" came the resounding cries from angry protesters as they faced off with security forces during demonstrations that swept through Lebanon's major cities on Monday.\n\nOne demonstrator, Fawaz Fouad al-Samman, died on Tuesday morning after sustaining gunshot wounds during clashes with the army in the northern city of Tripoli, his sister and a fellow protester said. The hospital that treated Samman's wounds confirmed his death to CNN. Protesters dubbed the 26-year-old as \"the martyr of hunger.\"\n\nIn a tweet, the Lebanese army said it was \"deeply sorry for the falling of a martyr\" during Monday's protests and said it has opened an inquiry into the death. The military added that rioting was carried out by \"infiltrators,\" and stated that it \"will not tolerate any person in breach of security and stability.\"\n\nTripoli protester Ghassan, who did not want to disclose his full name for security reasons, was with Samman when he was injured. Referring to Lebanon's uprising, which began in October, Ghassan told CNN: \"It was the worst battle we've seen since the start of the revolution.\"\n\nProtesters return with a vengeance\n\nThe demonstrations have renewed after a nearly two-month coronavirus-induced respite in the popular uprising. As the spread of the virus has slowed to less than 10 new reported cases per day, protesters have returned to the streets with a vengeance. The country's banks have borne the brunt of people's anger.\n\nVideo shot by protesters on Monday showed charred storefronts and an army vehicle on fire as clashes raged between demonstrators and soldiers in Tripoli, Lebanon's poorest city. Demonstrators cheered after a Molotov cocktail set a bank branch alight, according to the footage.\n\nClashes renewed on Tuesday afternoon in the center of Tripoli. Security forces fired tear gas at protesters as they tried to set bank branches alight and hurled stones.\n\nMourners prepare to bury the body of protester Fawaz al-Samman, who died of a gunshot wound sustained during clashes in Tripoli.\n\n\"The problem is that you're having a combined crisis, between the essential economic crisis and the Covid-19 crisis,\" said Musharrafieh. \"Unfortunately with the problem of the Covid-19, the situation has been compounded.\"\n\n\"We're working hard on an economic plan that could try to pull us out of this situation. We are in a position that is difficult but we are hopeful that we can get out of it,\" he added.\n\nSince 2019, the banking sector has imposed discretionary capital controls to avoid a rush on banks. On any given work day, long lines of people can be seen flocking to bank branches trying desperate to convince tellers to allow them to withdraw cash.\n\nLebanese authorities have resisted calls to formalize these capital controls. Some experts believe this situation disproportionately hurts small depositors, and allows the economic elite to exercise their influence to access their funds.\n\nThose fears were confirmed last weekend when Prime Minister Hassan Diab announced that $5.7 billion was transferred out of cash-strapped Lebanon's banks in January and February 2020. Diab has been scathing in his criticism of the country's long-time Central Bank Governor Riad Salame and has called for the bank to be audited.\n\nSporadic riots against the banks ensued, intensifying on Monday night as more people took to the streets after Ramadan's nightly Taraweeh prayers.\n\nDiab's government, which was brought to power by Hezbollah's parliamentary majority coalition during the country's uprising, has also been the target of street anger.\n\nProtesters closed the Northern Highway during a protest against the collapsing currency and the price hikes of goods.\n\nThe current cabinet is composed of politically-backed technocrats and has sought to present itself as an independent body. But praise for its steps to combat corruption -- such as the unprecedented criticism of Salame -- has been reserved, with many protesters dismissing the cabinet as a puppet government for the Iran-backed political and militant group Hezbollah.\n\nWhen parliament met for the first time since the coronavirus outbreak last week, protesters took to the streets to voice their disapproval of the government. Wearing medical masks and staging demonstrations in their vehicles, the protesters attempted to practice social distancing while mounting pressure on Diab's cabinet.\n\n'Coronavirus is the least of their concerns'\n\nThe government has received some credit for largely succeeding in preventing a major outbreak of the virus so far. But it is also being criticized for mishandling its aid program for the country's poor.\n\nAid distribution has been repeatedly delayed due to political wrangling, drawing the ire of the country's growing legions of impoverished people who have thrown their caution over coronavirus to the wind.\n\n\"I think the coronavirus is the least of their concerns,\" Mira Minkara, a Tripoli tour guide, entrepreneur and activist told CNN.\n\n\"People are really, really desperate. What happened yesterday is an authentic reaction to the desperation, to the frustration and to the pain that people are feeling,\" she said. \"It's not normal pain. It's the pain of when you're hungry, you're angry and you're sad that you can't pay rent any more and you can't eat.\"\n\nAcross Lebanon, people scrounge garbage dumps for food and beg passersby for bread. Less visible are the country's most vulnerable communities -- refugees and migrant workers -- who activists say suffer from unprecedented levels of food insecurity.\n\nPeople inspect a bank set ablaze overnight by some protesters following a demonstration in Tripoli.\n\nAccording to the International Rescue Committee, 87% of refugees in the country lack food, and a majority fear eviction. Migrant rights activists point to growing unemployment among largely Asian and African female migrant workers, which has forced them out of homes and into crammed tiny apartments which they share with other workers.\n\nIn Tripoli, the main protest site of Al-Nour is looking increasingly grim. Once a place where jubilant protesters sang songs about a better future in October, the square now bears the scars of confrontation and the floor is scattered with bullets. The protesters warn that the demonstrations will take an even darker turn.\n\n\"The reason for the riots that happened yesterday is hunger and the theft of people's money,\" said protester Ghassan. \"Now the country is below zero and people are dying of hunger.\n\n\"But soon this hunger will eat the rulers. What's to come is worse ... shame on them.\"", "link": "https://us.cnn.com/2020/04/28/middleeast/lebanon-hunger-aid-coronavirus-intl/index.html", "published": "2020-04-28T00:00:00", "author": ["Tamara Qiblawi"]}, {"title": "Saudi Arabia stops death penalty for people who committed crimes as minors", "text": "Abu Dhabi (CNN) Saudi Arabia is abolishing the death penalty for people who committed crimes as minors, the state-backed Human Rights Commission (HRC) said in a statement Sunday.\n\nThe decision was part of a royal decree, the statement said, and came two days after an announcement that public floggings would be banned.\n\nAnyone who received a death sentence after being convicted of crimes they committed as a minor will receive a prison sentence of no longer than 10 years in a juvenile detention facility, the statement said.

He was arrested in Berlin last February and charged by German prosecutors with crimes against humanity.\n\nRaslan and a former junior officer, Eyad A were arrested under the principle of universal jurisdiction, which gives a national court jurisdiction over grave crimes against international law, even when they were not committed on the country's territory. Attempts to set up an international tribunal have been hampered by Russian and Chinese vetoes at the United Nations Security Council.\n\nRaslan's trial in Koblenz is the first court proceeding against a senior member of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's regime, which has been repeatedly accused of war crimes and crimes against humanity over the course of the country's nine-year war.\n\nAnother former junior regime officer, identified by German authorities as Eyad A, is also standing trial for crimes against humanity.\n\nSyrian officials have repeatedly denied the allegations, insisting they target terrorists and not peaceful protesters.

He said he was repeatedly beaten, while blindfolded with his hands bound, when he was jailed in al-Khatib prison, where Raslan headed interrogations.\n\n\"In one of the interrogation sessions, someone ripped off my blindfold, and I saw Raslan who then punched me again and again,\" said Matar, now based in Berlin. \"I was later beaten and kicked by a group of men. I couldn't walk for days after that.\"\n\nSyrian defendant Anwar Raslan (2ndR), 57, arrives at court for an unprecedented trial on state-sponsored torture in Syria.\n\nRaslan is accused of overseeing the torture of at least 4,000 prisoners between April 29, 2011 and September 7, 2012, according to a court statement. At least 58 of the prisoners died. Rape and sexual assault allegedly occurred in at least one case.\n\nAt least three of Raslan's accusers were in court for the first hearing. Several more are expected to deliver witness testimony to the courts.\n\nMatar, who was unable to attend Thursday's hearing because of restrictions over the coronavirus, says he looks forward to taking the witness stand, and \"looking (Raslan) in the eye.\"\n\nThat the trial is happening at all is seen as a major victory for lawyers and investigators, including Syria's \"document hunters,\" who smuggled hundreds of thousands of government documents out of war zones. The documents, compiled by the Commission for International Justice and Accountability (CIJA), have served as evidence at judicial proceedings.\n\n\"This is a historic day for Syrians and all those fighting the absolute impunity we have been seeing for the crimes committed by the regime apparatus,\" Bill Wiley, founder and executive director of CIJA, told CNN.\n\n\"There are other Assad officials who think they found refuge in European countries and CIJA is working to support more such prosecutions in the near future.\"\n\nJoint plaintiffs and judges (background) are seen at the courtroom prior to the start of the session.\n\n\"The systematic investigation of the Assad government's crimes -- particularly systematic and widespread torture -- is a start,\" said the European Center for Constitutional and Human Rights (ECCHR), which represents 17 plaintiffs at Raslan's trial.\n\n\"The criminal proceedings are first of all important for the survivors involved in the trial.

When leading epidemiologist Neil Ferguson was forced to resign from the scientific body advising the government for breaching lockdown, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said he was left speechless by the \"extraordinary\" breach. On Saturday, Hancock said Cummings' trip was \"entirely right.\"\n\nThat defense was bruised on Sunday, after the same papers dropped new details alleging Cummings had been seen in the Durham area on multiple occasions after his initial trip. Downing Street has rebutted the subsequent claims, saying in a statement that they \"will not waste our time answering a stream of false allegations about Mr. Cummings from campaigning newspapers.\"\n\nCummings' influence over ministers is well documented in the British political press, but Downing Street's approach is no longer being followed by several of Johnson's own backbenchers, who one by one began to call on Cummings to go on Sunday.\n\n\"Enough is enough,\" Conservative lawmaker Steve Baker wrote in an opinion piece for The Critic website . \"Dominic Cummings must go before he does any more harm to the UK, the Government, the Prime Minister, our institutions or the Conservative Party.\"\n\nAnd concerns have been raised that the government's defense of Cummings' behavior has given implicit permission to the public to interpret the lockdown rules however they see fit.\n\n\"There cannot be one rule for Dominic Cummings and another for the British people,\" the opposition Labour Party said in a statement.\n\nA scandal at the end of a torrid week\n\nThe timing of the controversy is particularly unfortunate for the Prime Minister, who has overseen the deadliest Covid-19 outbreak in Europe and who was forced into an embarrassing U-turn on a controversial fee for immigrant health care workers just days earlier.\n\nOn Thursday the Prime Minister was forced into his first major policy U-turn since winning a sizable majority in December's general election, agreeing to scrap a heavily criticized fee that overseas NHS and health care workers were forced to pay while simultaneously working on the front lines of the country's coronavirus battle.\n\n\"We cannot clap our carers one day and then charge them to use our NHS the next,\" said Labour leader Keir Starmer, who is proving a formidable opponent to Johnson as he settles into the position he took over in April. Starmer was referring to the weekly round of applause for health workers that Britons have been taking part in.\n\nJohnson had defended the surcharge as late as Wednesday, telling MPs \"we must look at the realities\" and insisting the fee was \"the right way forward\" to provide the NHS with funding.\n\nBut by Thursday the policy was gone, amid growing discontent among Tory backbenchers. The change in tone added to the criticism Johnson has faced over the NHS, with opponents pointing to a lack in personal protective equipment (PPE) and a slow rate of testing.\n\nThroughout the controversies, Britain's death toll has continued to climb. Though it is well past its peak of cases and deaths, the country has seen more fatalities from Covid-19 than any other country in Europe, with more than 36,000 in total.\n\nThe country is entering its final week under the current phase of lockdown.

Why Britain could really struggle to dig itself out of recession", "text": "London (CNN Business) As nations around the world attempt to dig their way out of a cataclysmic global recession, Britain is in a particularly tight spot of its own making.\n\nThe country is in the middle of an economic disaster and a health crisis. The Bank of England has predicted that the United Kingdom is heading for its worst economic crash in more than 300 years , while its death toll from Covid-19 is the highest in Europe\n\nYet the United Kingdom is also racing toward a self-imposed deadline to construct a post-Brexit trade agreement with the European Union, its single biggest market for exports, by the end of the year. Talks are not going well \u2014 raising the possibility of another major shock just as the expected economic recovery gains momentum.\n\n\"The whole of the advanced world is in recession because of the coronavirus,\" said Kallum Pickering, senior economist at Berenberg Bank. \"But the UK has an additional problem of the UK-EU negotiations in the second half of the year.\"\n\nA historic recession\n\nEven without considering the implications of Brexit, the UK economy is in dire straits.\n\nThe Bank of England said earlier this month that the economy could shrink by 14% this year. That would be the biggest annual contraction since a decline of 15% in 1706, based on the bank's best estimate of historical data. GDP could fall by 25% in the three months to the end of June.\n\nData released by the UK government in recent days has been harrowing. Claims for unemployment benefits soared by 69% to almost 2.1 million last month. Inflation in April, meanwhile, declined for its third consecutive month to 0.8%, raising concerns that prices could be entering a damaging downward spiral.\n\nRestaurants and non-essential shops remain closed, and economists aren't confident that activity will pick up right away once they reopen.\n\nShutters are down at closed tourist shops in London on May 12.\n\nThe grim mood was reflected Wednesday when the UK government sold its first bond ever with a negative yield . This indicated demand was so high that investors were essentially willing to pay the British government to lend it money.\n\nGilts, as they're known, are considered a safe-haven asset, alongside US, Japanese and German government bonds; elevated demand signals that investors are worried economic growth will remain depressed.\n\n\"The markets are reflecting the economic reality, which is that the economy has collapsed,\" said Robert Wood, chief UK economist at Bank of America.\n\nFTSE 100 UKX The British pound has dropped more than 8% since the start of the year to less than $1.22, and has also fallen more than 5% against the euro . Theindex in London has lost more than 21% year-to-date, compared to nearly 9% for the S&P 500, while the FTSE 250 index of midsize British companies is down more than 26%.\n\nAttempting to stem the vast economic damage, the UK government borrowed \u00a362.1 billion ($75.7 billion) in April, the highest level since records began in 1993. The government now projects it will need to borrow \u00a3298.4 billion ($363.3 billion) through March 2021, almost twice as much as at the height of the global financial crisis.\n\nAnd Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey even hinted this week that official interest rates \u2014 currently 0.1% \u2014 could go negative for the first time in British history. His comments have encouraged speculation that the bank could opt for negative rates in 2021, should the economy need another shot in the arm then.\n\n\"What the Bank of England has done is remove the floor on policy rates, so you can't assume they will definitely not cut\" below zero, Wood said. \"That said, clearly negative rates are one of the last resorts here.\"\n\nBrexit clock ticking\n\nThe risk they may be needed is rising because UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has committed to nailing down the terms of the UK's new relationship with the European Union by the end of 2020, following its exit from the bloc in January.\n\nFailure to reach an agreement could subject UK companies to steep new tariffs, threaten their supply chains and make their products and services more expensive at the worst possible moment. The United Kingdom has until June 30 to ask for an extension to the deadline, but the Johnson government has consistently said it does not want to do this.\n\nTalks are not going well, however. Michel Barnier, the EU's chief Brexit negotiator, said last week that he was \"not optimistic\" about reaching a deal with the United Kingdom, adding that the EU will step up preparations for the year to end without new terms of trade in place.\n\nThe UK's chief Brexit negotiator, David Frost, said in a letter to Barnier on Tuesday that the EU was offering up \"a relatively low-quality trade agreement.\"\n\nWorsening your trade terms with the destination for nearly half your exports will be an economic negative.\" ROBERT WOOD, BANK OF AMERICA\n\nWithout a deal, industries that have already been hit hard by the pandemic would be battered even more.\n\nDavid Henig, a former trade negotiator and director of the UK Trade Policy Project at the European Centre for International Political Economy, said on Twitter Thursday that a 10% tariff on cars shipped to the European Union would kick in if an agreement isn't reached, threatening at least \u00a315 billion ($18.3 billion) in exports.\n\nPickering of Berenberg Bank is concerned that the running clock on Brexit talks could create problems for the United Kingdom in the second half of the year, when economic growth is meant to be picking back up.\n\nHousehold spending, which makes up around 70% of GDP in the UK, will determine the trajectory of the UK's recovery, he said. As the lockdown ends, the worry is that Britons will keep saving their money due to anxiety about their jobs or a second wave of infections, limiting the impact of government and central bank relief efforts.\n\nUncertainty tied to Brexit will only encourage that excessive saving , according to Pickering.\n\nEven if the United Kingdom does reach a new trade agreement with the European Union, it won't be as favorable as the old regime. Johnson is pushing for a deal that would allow the United Kingdom to also strike an agreement with trading partners such as the United States.\n\nIn the draft proposal released by the UK government this week, Britain reaffirmed that it does not want to be part of the EU single market, and is instead seeking a deal in line with what the bloc has in place with Canada or Japan.\n\n\"Worsening your trade terms with the destination for nearly half your exports will be an economic negative,\" Bank of America's Wood said. \"[It's] another reason to expect the recovery from this crisis to be a very elongated U [shape], and not a V.\"\n\nIrish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar echoed this view on Thursday.\n\n\"Brexit will further complicate matters,\" Varadkar said. \"As I said a few months ago, Brexit's not over. It's only halftime.\"", "link": "https://us.cnn.com/2020/05/22/economy/uk-economy-coronavirus-brexit/index.html", "published": "2020-05-22T00:00:00", "author": ["Analysis Julia Horowitz", "Cnn Business", "Robert Wood", "Bank Of America"]}, {"title": "The United Kingdom's four countries take a divided approach to coronavirus crisis", "text": "London (CNN) The UK's coronavirus crisis has reignited one of the country's most bitter political debates: Can the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland survive as a union of four nations?\n\nHe called on millions of people to return to work, and gave a rough outline of when schools and shops might reopen over the comings months. He also shifted his government's core message from the simple \"Stay Home, Protect the NHS, Save Lives\" to the more ambiguous \"Stay Alert, Control the Virus, Save Lives.\"\n\nBut before Johnson's message was even broadcast, Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon delivered her own address. In doing so, she revealed the uncomfortable reality that Johnson has little practical power over the people living in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.\n\nOf Johnson's roadmap, Sturgeon said the Scottish government had \"not yet seen the full detail of the plan, so it's not possible for us to simply adopt it for Scotland,\" and that she had asked Downing Street \"not to deploy their 'Stay Alert' advertising campaign in Scotland.\" The message there was still clearly to \"stay home.\"\n\nIt was, of course, her right to do so. \"For around 20 years, the government of the UK has only really been the government of England in huge areas of policy,\" says John Denham, a former Labour lawmaker and professorial fellow on English identity at the University of Southampton.\n\nSince the late 1990s, Westminster has ceded much power to legislative bodies in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, allowing devolved governments to set domestic policy in areas such as health and education.\n\nSo it is little surprise that Sturgeon was confused when Johnson began talking about the opening of schools, among other things, on Sunday night. \"Discussing schools, for example, he used year group terms that don't even make sense in Scotland. It wasn't at all clear in the statement what guidance applied to the whole UK and what applied to England specifically,\" says Nicola McEwen, professor of territorial politics at the University of Edinburgh.\n\nSources inside Downing Street have told CNN that Johnson himself thought the message was confusing. \"Filming was a total nightmare. He was stopping and starting, asking to change bits, complaining about the length, saying it was all too complex,\" said one government source who was not permitted to speak on the record.\n\nWhile this might give little comfort to those in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, who too often feel like an afterthought, it has raised important questions about how much longer the current arrangement can continue \u2014 and also how desirable it is. All three devolved administrations have deviated from Westminster in their handling of this crisis, despite the perception that Johnson and Downing Street has been driving the coronavirus response for the entire UK.\n\nThe most striking example of this came on Wednesday morning, as images flooded social media of commuters packed into London's transport network, as large parts of England returned to work. In stark contrast, the other three nations, which are advising people to stay home, are keeping their economies in stricter lockdown. In England, you can now meet one other person outside your household in public \u2014 that's not something you can do anywhere else in the UK.\n\nDenham thinks that the pandemic has been a wake up call for how different the four nations have become. \"In relative terms, England has a much weaker state than the other three and has a far more centralized center of power. Coronavirus has revealed that on some key issues the other nations cannot and do not want to work with England and the way in which it is governed.\"\n\nMcEwen agrees that the pandemic has shone a light on the asymmetrical political power in the UK, which had taken a battering over the past four years of the country's Brexit debate.\n\n\"The strained relationships between the UK government and the devolved governments over the past few years have been exacerbated by the fact that the four nations are now run by different political parties who have different ideologies and different ideas about the UK's future.\"\n\nAll this creates a political headache for Johnson, who as well as being Prime Minister, is also leader of what is officially still the Conservative and Unionist party. Shortly after entering Downing Street last year, Johnson appointed himself Minister for the Union, in a sign of his commitment to strengthening the ties between the four nations, after the damage Brexit had done.\n\nSenior Conservative unionists told CNN that their perception is that Johnson did this to keep his own party happy, rather than out of a sincere desire to protect the union. Their concern isn't that he actively wants to see an end of the union, but that the union he wants to preserve is one with England at the center of it, run from London.\n\nThe problem is, this view of the union isn't particularly popular in any corner of the UK outside of the capital. \"English voters, especially, leave voters, tend to prioritize their English identity and want English interests put ahead of the Union,\" says Denham. \"It's not that they are anti-union, it's that their idea of Britishness is as an extension of Englishness and English interests. If the two come into conflict then they prioritize English interests.\"\n\nThis English-centric view of the union understandably grates elsewhere in the UK. \"There is a sense in Wales that Westminster doesn't understand or particularly respect devolution,\" says Roger Awan-Scully, Professor of Politics at Cardiff University and chair of the Political Studies Association. \"When it comes down to it, they see devolved governments as a necessary irritation. Coronavirus has definitely bought some of this into sharper focus.\"\n\nNorthern Ireland again a 'place between'\n\nThe union question is arguably most complicated in Northern Ireland. The national assembly at Stormont relies on a power-sharing agreement between unionists and republicans. The island of Ireland's recent history means that virtually no issue can hit Stormont without becoming politicized.\n\nCoronavirus has presented republicans with an opportunity to argue that an all-Ireland approach would be preferable to Northern Ireland keeping in lockstep with Britain. \"When you think of it from the nationalist point of view, Ireland is one island. We can shut down the external borders and handle this as one island. It makes total sense to them,\" says Katy Hayward from Queen's University Belfast.\n\nHowever, unionists would point to the importance of UK government financial support during the crisis. Hayward notes. \"The five-party executive has had to look in two directions at once, to manage the fact that Northern Ireland is very much a 'place between.'\"\n\nWhile no one believes that the Covid-19 pandemic will bring about the death of the union, Johnson's handling of the crisis has exacerbated divisions between its four nations at a time when the UK was already in the middle of an existential crisis over Brexit.\n\n\"The English-centric idea of union was fostered as part of the imperial Britain,\" says Denham. \"The truth is that old idea of the union lost its sense of purpose decades ago. And in that time, the other parts of the union asserted their identity (or in Northern Ireland, identities). If government really wants the union to survive, it has to be a partnership between all the nations.\"\n\nThe question is, are the English, who make up over 80% of the United Kingdom, really bothered enough about saving the union to do so?", "link": "https://us.cnn.com/2020/05/14/uk/united-kingdom-divided-approach-coronavirus-intl-gbr/index.html", "published": "2020-05-14T00:00:00", "author": ["Analysis Luke Mcgee"]}, {"title": "The pandemic could reshape the world order.

They say there are no prizes for second place; that's not entirely true, but a silver medal isn't much of a consolation. The losers would often prefer to be forgotten.\n\nBut if there is to be a fate worse than finishing as the runner-up, it's being remembered only because you blew it, choked, snatched defeat from the jaws of victory.\n\nThe history books of sport are littered with many such examples. Golf can be particularly cruel; just think of Greg Norman's epic collapse in the 1996 Masters or the hapless Jean van de Velde at the 1999 Open Championship, where he threw away a three-shot lead on the very last hole.\n\nSuch calamities can define a career or even shape the identity of a city. Atlanta in the United States is still maligned because of the Falcons' monumental capitulation in Super Bowl LI, when they somehow blew a 25-point lead late in the third quarter of the NFL's showpiece game.\n\nWhilst Milan is not a city you'd ever associate with sporting failure -- their football teams AC Milan and Internazionale are among the most successful in Europe -- there is one particular outlier: In the 2005 Champions League final, AC Milan raced into a 3-0 lead against Liverpool and somehow trudged off the field as losers.\n\nEarlier this month, former AC Milan goalkeeper Dida, who played in the final, told CNN, \"It's truly difficult to imagine after that first half, which we performed practically to perfection, that we would lose three goals.\"\n\nPhotos: Snatching defeat from the jaws of victory. 1996: The Masters -- Greg Norman held a six-shot lead heading into Sunday, but a torrid final round of 78 opened the door and Nick Faldo took advantage, winning his third green jacket by five strokes.

Fifteen years later, that game is still celebrated as 'The Miracle of Istanbul,' one of the greatest nights in European club football. But not for the losers; for them, it was a nightmare. Milan's perspective of that fateful night is not one you often hear.\n\nTo say that Milan were the favorites in Istanbul would have been a serious understatement; the class of 2005 was a team packed full of international megastars and high achievers. Seven of Milan's starting 11 had won the Champions League just two years previously.\n\nBrazilians Cafu, Dida and Kaka were all World Cup winners, while the following summer, Andrea Pirlo, Gennaro Gattuso and Alessandro Nesta would be world champions with Italy.\n\nUkrainian striker Andriy Schevchenko was the 2004 Ballon d'Or winner, arguably the greatest individual recognition in the game and an honor that Kaka would later claim in 2007. Captain Paolo Maldini was a Milan and Italy legend, regarded as one of the best defenders in the history of the game and a player who'd won four of his five European Cups by the time of this game.\n\n\"The team was spectacular,\" lifelong Milan Paolo Agostinelli, who had tickets to the game in Istanbul, but had to cancel his trip at short notice, told CNN Sport. Nonetheless, as he tuned in to watch the game on television, he expected only one result, \"I was positive that we would have won that match, I was confident. I was very confident.\"\n\nPaolo Agostinelli, right, is pictured with his father and son.\n\nThe reason for such heady optimism wasn't just Milan's galaxy of stars; it was the perceived weakness of the opposition. Though Liverpool had once dominated the English league and European competitions, such success was -- by that time -- a rather distant memory.\n\nIn 2005, Liverpool's domestic performance in the Premier League was so poor that they hadn't even qualified for the next Champions League season. They'd finished fifth. Milan's starting 11 was a who's who of international football; Liverpool's team was more of a 'who are you?'\n\nIn the 20 years since Liverpool had even played in the European Cup final, AC Milan had won it four times. Granted, Liverpool's ambitions were hampered by UEFA's five-year ban for all English teams after the Heysel Stadium disaster, but regardless -- they'd been absent from the top table for a long time.\n\nOn the eve of the game, the teams made their case to the international media. Maldini was compelling; \"History counts and in recent years, Milan has always been at this level.\"\n\nLiverpool's first-year manager Rafael Benitez told the assembled press that he was hoping for an early goal, but Maldini volleying the ball into the back of the net after just 50 seconds was not quite the early strike that he had in mind.\n\nAs Paolo Agostinelli remembers it, \"We were playing fabulous football, the team was confident and everything was fine and then Maldini scored. That was a sign of destiny. Maldini never scores.\"\n\nMilan were purring; their Brazilian goalkeeper Dida chuckled when CNN asked him recently if he had much to do in the first half: \"Honestly not much,\" he admitted. \"The concentration and focus of the team were extremely high.\"\n\nBy halftime, a couple of goals from Hernan Crespo had given the Italians a 3-0 lead. It was a lead that seemed insurmountable.\n\nLiverpool's Polish goalkeeper Jerzy Dudek (C) celebrates surrounded by teammates at the end of the Champions League football final against AC Milan.\n\n'Something unreal happened'\n\nAntonio Greco goes by the name Uccio. Founder of the Gallipoli supporters club in 1984, he's a lifelong Milan supporter, estimating that he's been to some 400 games. He's watched them lift the European cup in Madrid, Barcelona, Vienna, twice in Athens and also Manchester.\n\n\"It was a great first half; the supporters asked me to unveil our celebratory banners.\" But then, in the second half, \"something unreal happened.\"\n\nAC Milan fan Antonio Greco.\n\nWhat happened next has become the stuff of legend in Liverpool. As the teams left the field for the fifteen-minute interval, it was hard to tell which team was losing. The supporters at the Liverpool end of the Atat\u00fcrk Stadium defiantly held their scarves aloft, serenading their heroes with hymns of praise and the spine-tingling 'You'll Never Walk Alone.'\n\nThe Liverpool players could hear it from their dressing room, and defender Sami Hyypia told CNN\" \"Maybe that gave us a little bit of strength. Rafa Benitez just said, 'Look boys, it can't continue like this. We have to give the fans something to cheer about in the second half.' He was quite calm.\"\n\nAcross the hall, the Milan team was also calm, or tranquillo, as Dida put it: \"Our trainer Carlo Ancelotti was tranquil; he didn't say much to us, but he said that we still had to put in all our efforts because there were still 45 minutes left. Therefore, we knew that we still had to make an effort.\"\n\nFootball is a sport littered with clich\u00e9s, but rarely has there ever been such a 'game of two halves.'\n\nJUST WATCHED Dida reflects on the 2005 and 2007 Champions League finals Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Dida reflects on the 2005 and 2007 Champions League finals 00:53\n\nAfter the break, Liverpool looked like a completely different side; a header from their young captain Steven Gerrard made the score 3-1, and within two minutes it was 3-2, thanks to Vladimir Smicer.\n\nMilan were rattled, and so were their fans.\n\nBack home in Italy, Agostinelli said that he'd stopped paying attention during halftime. His friend -- a Juventus supporter -- asked if they even really needed to watch the second half. But when Liverpool began scoring, the television had his attention again. \"I was petrified. I had a feeling of something sinister going up and down my back.\"\n\nWithin just 15 minutes of the restart and only six minutes after Liverpool's first goal, the game, incredibly, was tied at 3-3. Dida saved a penalty from Xabi Alonso, but the Spaniard followed up on the rebound to score the equalizer.\n\nWatching in disbelief from Milan, Agostinelli said, \"When I saw that Dida had made the save, but it still wasn't enough, in that very moment, I knew this was lost.\"\n\nInside the stadium, Milan's supporters were witnessing an epic collapse and an extreme shift of emotions. Greco was trying to process what he'd just witnessed, he told telling CNN, \"I was shocked, literally. I couldn't stand anymore and my first thought was to get to the airport and go back home as soon as possible.\"\n\nWhen you ask players from both sides what happened, none are really able to explain it.\n\nDida described the anxiety creeping in, but felt they still had \"the ability to do more in the game; we had the strikers, we had the strength in our legs. Even though it was 3-3, we still thought we could win the match.\"\n\nIstanbul, Turkey: Liverpool's captain Steven Gerrard kisses the throphy surrounded by teammates at the end of the UEFA Champions league football final AC Milan vs Liverpool, 25 May 2005 at the Ataturk Stadium in Istanbul.\n\n'A terrible evening'\n\nLevel after 90 minutes, the game went to an extra period of half an hour; but with the drama of a penalty shootout looming, Milan still had one last chance.\n\nIt fell to their exceptional striker Schevchenko, but he was twice brilliantly denied by Liverpool's Polish goalkeeper Jerzy Dudek. For Greco, that was definitive: \"At that moment I really understood that AC Milan would lose the cup -- a terrible evening.\"\n\nIn the subsequent shootout, Milan missed their first penalty, Dudek saved two more, and Liverpool completed their most extraordinary comeback to win their fifth -- and most improbable -- European Cup.\n\nIt was 'The Miracle of Istanbul', but for Milan it was 'The Nightmare,' 'The Tragedy,' 'The Curse of Istanbul;' their fans used all three words to describe it. Their exultant high had been cruelly dashed in a crazy period of just six minutes.\n\nGreco says that he was still in shock when he got home and didn't want to get off the plane. \"The flight attendant had to come and convince me,\" he said.\n\n\"Sometimes when we watch the match today, we still can't believe it,\" laments Dida. \"We still think about it. We got so close; how could it be?\"\n\nOften in sport, when a team has capitulated so spectacularly, the fans can't help but turn on them. But Agostinelli, who'd attended two previous European Cup victories, says that didn't happen here.\n\n\"They had won the final in 2003; there were a lot of players that we loved. There was no tension between the fans and the team. The coach was a Milanista and we all loved him. There was no resentment. It was like we were fighting against an obscure, invincible force. It was supernatural.\n\n\"This was something so extraordinary, so impossible that only something equally impossible could fix it. And kind of the impossible happened two years later.\"\n\nCarlo Ancelotti walks by the throphy at the end of the Champions League final between AC Milan and Liverpool in Istanbul.\n\nChance for revenge\n\nIn 2007, this time in Athens, Liverpool and Milan met again in the final of the Champions League. The chances of a rematch occurring so soon would have been incredibly slim: same clubs, same managers and many of the same players. Liverpool had enjoyed their miracle, but this was Milan's chance for revenge, and it was on hallowed ground because since Milan had also won the Champions League at the Olympic Stadium in 1994.\n\nThe game was tense, combative and although Liverpool created more chances, it was Milan that held their nerve. They had learned their lesson from 2005.\n\nDida is much happier recalling the game in Athens: \"The true difference between the two matches was our concentration,\" he remembered.\n\n\"It was much, much stronger than before; every aspect was under control.\" Late goals in each half from Filippo Inzaghi -- who had been injured for the game in Istanbul -- gave Milan a 2-0 lead, and Liverpool's 90th-minute strike from Dirk Kuyt proved to be merely a consolation. The curse had swiftly been broken.\n\n\"We hugged and saluted each other, and then our fathers, sons were all there; it was a truly wonderful sensation,\" said Dida. \"It was proof that we could have also done the same thing two years before, but we must try to forget the game that we lost and focus on what we have won.\"\n\nMilan were back on top of Europe, re-establishing themselves as one of the powerhouses of the continental game. After the match, Milan's defender Gennaro Gattuso told the media: \"The defeat two years ago will stay with me for a lifetime, but this is a different story. It's our turn to celebrate now.\"\n\nAt the final whistle, up in the stands, Greco had some unfinished business. \"It was unbelievable, the emotion and joy that I felt was enormous. We finally unrolled the banner that had been left rolled-up since Istanbul 2005, with tears in our eyes.\"\n\nRarely has such a heartbreaking defeat been transformed into such satisfying revenge, but Athens will always be tinged with regret. Milan may have choked in 2005 and the scars from that evening will never completely heal, but in 2007 they did everything possible to put it behind them. Expecting everyone else to forget it, though?\n\nWell -- that would take another miracle.", "link": "https://us.cnn.com/2020/05/22/football/liverpool-ac-milan-champions-league-final-istanbul-cmd-spt-intl/index.html", "published": "2020-05-22T00:00:00", "author": ["Don Riddell"]}, {"title": "The extreme parkour team whose death-defying jumps caught the attention of Hollywood", "text": "(CNN) Jumping between high-rise buildings, launching themselves off cliffs and gliding across rooftops are commonplace for parkour group Storror.\n\nThe septet of British parkour specialists have amassed over 600 million views on YouTube and even worked on a Hollywood film.\n\nThe group, which started on 10/10/10, is celebrating its 10th anniversary this year and over the last decade has filmed around the world, from Seoul to Madrid (a favorite destination). But with the world in lockdown changes have had to be made.\n\nThey should be in Nepal filming, but are instead searching for ways to create content from home.\n\nLiving separately, Storror members have been filming videos on their own and then editing the footage together. But making engaging content for their fans while not encouraging them to break lockdown rules is a fine line.\n\n\"I think that's part of this whole maturity thing and learning to understand our responsibility, like we're taking the lockdown seriously,\" Drew Taylor, professional parkour athlete and Storror member, told CNN Sport\n\nThe seven members of Storror.\n\nWhile mastering parkour has come through years of training, the group -- which includes Taylor, Toby Segar, Sacha Powell, Joshua Burnett Blake, Callum Powell and founders, Max and Benj Cave -- has also put on workshops for groups of refugees\n\n\"I think most of us can agree we've kind of overshot even our greatest expectations of what we wanted to do with this when we were a kid,\" added Taylor.\n\nA member of Storror looks down at the streets below.\n\nMoving up in the world\n\nLast year the group worked on the set of a Hollywood movie after being invited by award-winning Hollywood director Michael Bay -- also director of the 'Transformers' trilogy and the 'Bad Boys' films -- to assist in the filming of '6 Underground,' his Netflix film starring Ryan Reynolds and Dave Franco.\n\nThey were given the freedom to instruct experienced cameramen as they saw fit, while also serving as actors' stunt doubles.\n\nDuring their time on set, the group also performed stunts on famous sites, such as the Florence Cathedral, while also training other actors in the basics of parkour.\n\nToby Segar jumps between objects.\n\nWorking on a Hollywood movie set was \"affirmation that we were moving in the right direction,\" Segar, one of Storror's members, told CNN Sport.\n\n\"It was skipping a lot of steps in the movie industry, in terms of learning about how they do it,\" Segar said.\n\n\"It was a really crazy position to be in, where we have control over these scenes and we have control over certain elements of this blockbuster movie.

Here, the soil has been freshly turned to make new graves, 120 in all, the morning we visited. Another body was to be buried that afternoon.\n\nA simple, white plastic cross marks each grave. Taped to each cross is a piece of paper bearing a surname, sometimes with an initial, sometimes with a first name. No date of birth. No date of death. Cemetery workers have placed a single plastic flower on each grave.\n\nHere lie those who succumbed to coronavirus in Milan, but whose bodies have yet to be claimed.\n\nPlot 87 in Milan's main cemetery, where the unclaimed dead are buried.\n\nAn official at the cemetery, who requested that his name not be used, told me most of them were old and had been in nursing homes. Many, he added, had no families. In a few cases, the families of the dead have been unable to claim the bodies because of the lockdown.\n\nWith morgues filled to capacity, and more dying each day at the peak of the outbreak, authorities in Italy's coronavirus hotspots had little choice but to bury the unclaimed dead like this. If their families come forward to claim the bodies once the epidemic is over, the remains will be exhumed and reburied.\n\nThose laid to rest here died alone. Then again, with coronavirus, almost everyone dies alone.\n\nCarla Porfirio wanted desperately to be with her mother in her final moments.\n\nBefore the coronavirus outbreak, she visited her 85-year-old mother Michela, who suffered from Alzheimer's disease, every day in Milan's sprawling Palazzolo-Don Gnocchi Institute nursing home.\n\nWhen the nursing home abruptly stopped relatives from visiting their loved ones as the virus spread, Porfirio said she called every day to ask about her mother. Every day the staff reassured her Michela was fine.\n\nPorfirio is concerned that she wasn't told when her mother first became unwell. When she called the home on Sunday April 5, she was informed that Michela had been put on oxygen and given morphine.\n\nShe died the next day.\n\nCarla Porfirio's 85-year-old mother died in a nursing home in Italy.\n\n\"What's so tragic for those of us who lost their loved ones,\" Porfirio told CNN, her voice breaking with emotion, is that \"we couldn't be close to them in their last days as they suffered. They needed the hand of their loved ones.\"\n\nAt the height of the pandemic's rampage through northern Italy, the regional government of Lombardy asked nursing homes to make room for non-critical Covid-19 patients, to lighten the massive burden on hospitals.\n\nPorfirio said the Palazzolo-Don Gnocchi nursing home put one of those patients in the same room as her mother and two other older women.\n\nWhen Porfirio protested, she says a staff member told her the home had no choice; it had run out of space.\n\nThe Palazzolo-Don Gnocchi Institute told CNN in a statement that \"starting from the detection of the first case ... at the Palazzolo Institute, the Don Gnocchi Foundation started the isolation, mapping and swab testing procedures on contacts exposed to the risk of contagion ... All Covid-19 positive cases were handled according to the protocols provided by the authorities, and in coordination with the authorities themselves.\"\n\nThe institute did not respond to Carla Porfirio's claims regarding the care of her mother.\n\nItalian authorities are investigating a string of health violations at elderly care homes across the country during the Covid-19 crisis.\n\nThe Palazzolo-Don Gnocchi Institute believes the investigation will show their work was proper.\n\n\"We are confident that the brief presented by the Foundation's lawyers at the Milan Public Prosecutor's Office and documents subsequently acquired by the judiciary will confirm the correctness of the Foundation's work in the context of this health emergency,\" it said.\n\nThe Lombardy regional government told CNN it is not giving interviews on \"the nursing home issue,\" due to the ongoing investigation.\n\nAt least 15 facilities have been closed and their patients relocated after inspections by the Italian Police health force -- Nuclei Antisofisticazione e Sanita (NAS) -- found that many failed to follow coronavirus protocols, including providing enough protective equipment for staff and dedicated quarantine areas for suspected coronavirus patients.\n\nSixty-one people have been referred to judicial authorities. Another 157 people have been fined a total of more than $78,500 (72,000 euros).\n\nLike many who lost loved ones in nursing homes to coronavirus, Carla Porfirio is indignant.\n\n\"It's uncivilized,\" she says. \"We're in 2020 and this still happens? The images are like the Spanish flu epidemic 100 years ago. And we're in the same condition?\" she asks.\n\nCalls for answers\n\nNot long ago, Alessandro Azzoni says his 75-year-old mother Marisa was physically strong and responsive, despite suffering from Alzheimer's. He regularly took her for walks, for an ice cream, to dance in the park.\n\nNow Marisa is in a critical condition, on life support, in a Milan hospital after being transferred from the city's Pio Albergo Trivulzio nursing home.\n\nThe Pio Albergo Trivulzio nursing home also admitted Covid-19 patients, and the virus spread.\n\nAzzoni presented a diagram on his phone of his mother's nursing home, based on information from doctors and nurses he said worked at the home. Much of the map is colored red, showing wards which now house Covid-19 patients.\n\nThe home is being investigated over multiple manslaughter complaints filed by staff and relatives of patients who say it failed to protect residents and medical workers against infection.\n\nMilan's Public Prosecutor Mauro Clerici said last month he was looking into \"more than 100 deaths,\" at the home during the Covid-19 epidemic.\n\nClerici said the inquiry would center on \"what crimes may have been committed in accordance with existing legislation as applied to a pandemic.\"\n\nNo arrests have been made and no one has been charged in the case.\n\nA spokesperson for the Pio Albergo Trivulzio nursing home refused to comment out of respect for the investigators, saying they needed \"to work freely and without pressures of any sort.\"\n\nLast month, a spokeswoman for the home told CNN that \"the rules regarding masks were followed,\" adding that the number of deaths in the first quarter of 2020 were in line with those in the same period last year.\n\nAzzoni, who founded a group demanding a criminal investigation into what happened at Pio Albergo Trivulzio, describes it as a \"massacre.\"\n\nWith an investigation, he says \"we have the opportunity to completely change things, to put humans back at the center.\"\n\nThe region of Lombardy accounts for about half of Italy's 32,169 dead from the virus.\n\nNembro's main nursing home, where in the space of just a few weeks many of its residents succumbed to the virus.\n\nOne of the hardest-hit communities in Lombardy is the town of Nembro, in the foothills of the Alps.\n\nOf the 87 residents in Nembro's main nursing home, the Nembro Nursing Home Foundation, 34 died from the virus.\n\nWhile law enforcement authorities won't comment on whether the home is under investigation, its director, Barbara Codalli, told CNN there are no allegations of wrongdoing against the home which, she says, never took in any Covid patients.\n\nAs soon as staff realized that the virus had spread to the home, Codalli said: \"We decided to shut down the structure to families and to close the day care, even if we didn't know at the time what was actually happening, but with the feeling that something out of the ordinary was happening.\"\n\n\"We started using PPE, masks, not easily because finding them was hard, we found them at absurd prices,\" she adds.\n\nBut still, the home was overwhelmed by the virus, which Codalli said badly hit its staff, killing its president and one of its doctors.\n\nShe blames the provincial health authorities for being late in testing the nursing home's residents.\n\nThe Lombardy regional government, which oversees the health authorities, would not comment citing the ongoing investigation.\n\nBarbara Codalli notes that when the first cases became evident in the third week of February it took weeks for swabs to be carried out.\n\n\"The very first swabs were done the 10th of April,\" she says, \"regardless of what some were claiming on television.\"\n\nNembro's mayor, Claudio Cancelli, confirmed to CNN that the first swabs, from the home's most severely ill patients, were taken beginning on April 10; he says that testing of all staff and the remaining patients only began on April 23.\n\nFresh tombs in Nembro's cemetery. This town suffered one of Italy's highest per capita death tolls as a result of coronavirus. Its undertakers and cemetery workers have been busy.\n\nIn Nembro, we searched for death notices -- but found only two recent ones. We called a funeral home to ask where we might find more. The undertaker explained the Nembro municipality had removed all but the latest ones, to avoid damaging morale in the town.\n\nMayor Cancelli confirmed that the death notices were removed, but denied that there was an official order to do so in order to boost citizens' spirits. He insisted the decision had been based on common sense, adding that if doing so had improved morale, he was satisfied with that.\n\nA set of notices from early March were found next to Nembro's cemetery which showed that in the space of just three days -- March 7 to 9 -- five elderly men and women had passed away.\n\nFunerals are finally being held again in Nembro as the lockdown in Italy eases.\n\n'A tsunami overwhelmed us'\n\nGiacomo Boffelli, 84, died on March 11. Friends and family were finally able say their farewells two months later, at a simple ceremony near the entrance to the town's cemetery.\n\nHis daughter, Nicoletta, read a statement. \"We never abandoned you. We never would, because you will always be in our hearts.\"\n\nGiacomo's widow, Margherita, sat and listened, the mask covering her nose and mouth moist from her tears.\n\nAfter the ceremony, as Giacomo's ashes were placed in the family tomb, Nicoletta told me: \"The woman who works here at the cemetery says that all of this part was empty before, and now it's filling up.\"\n\nIndeed fresh pictures mark the tombs of the recently deceased. Undertakers and grave diggers are the busiest people in Nembro now.\n\n\"It was as if a tsunami overwhelmed us, especially the oldest people,\" says Nicoletta.\n\nSpring has arrived in Lombardy.

But in an Instagram Live interview Sunday with a local journalist, the head of the republic's ministry of health gave figures far higher than Moscow's, saying the total number of people infected with coronavirus and community-acquired pneumonia in Dagestan exceeded 13,000, with 657 dead.\n\nAsked by journalist Ruslan Kurbanov to explain why Covid-19 and pneumonia cases were being counted separately, the health official, Dzhamaludin Gadzhiibragimov, responded that pneumonia patients are treated as if they have the virus, but not all cases are ascribed to coronavirus due to a lack of testing.\n\n\"Basically, the same [treatment] methodology is used for both,\" he said. \"But because we do not have lab test confirmation, the statistics are being compiled in that way.\"\n\nAs in other countries, frontline health workers in the region have been the most vulnerable to the deadly outbreak. Between 40 to 50 health workers have died in Dagestan since the beginning of the pandemic, according to estimates from Gadzhiibragimov and the region's chief mufti. Dagestan has a population of about 3 million people. According to Russia's health ministry, the region has 635 ICU beds and ventilators.\n\nDoctors in the region have complained in the past weeks on social media about the lack of protective equipment, and some hospitals have not had space to treat their staff. A video of nurses hooked up to intravenous drips in a storage room in the city of Derbent went viral in early May.\n\nCivil rights activist Ziyautdin Uvaisov, who is head of Patient Monitor, a non-profit organization that raised money to buy protective equipment for Dagestan's doctors, told CNN that the healthcare system in the region is in a really bad state.\n\n\"We have been talking about it since 2017 but unfortunately there is a habit to sweep everything under the rug,\" Uvaisov said.\n\nHe added that most of the doctors his organization interacts with say about a half of their colleagues are sick with no one to replace them as hospital wards overflow.\n\nDagestan's dire situation has put the republic into the spotlight of Russia's top-level officials. On Monday, Putin took the unusual step of chairing a special government session with Dagestani leaders.\n\n\"The situation in Dagestan is difficult and demands urgent measures,\" Putin said in a video conference, ordering the military to build a 200-bed hospital to help relieve overcrowded emergency rooms.\n\nMuch of the Russian government response to the pandemic has been hindered by bureaucracy and mismanagement of regional funds. In poorer regions like Dagestan, where the average monthly wage is two times lower than nationwide, according to Russia's state statistics agency, such foot-dragging became one of the key reasons behind severe outbreaks.\n\nAdditional payments promised by Putin to compensate for the hardships of frontline work became another grievance for health professionals.\n\n\"We've been at work since the very beginning of the pandemic and we've faithfully performed our duties -- now a lot of our colleagues are [confined] inside medical institutions, fighting for their lives,\" one paramedic from the city of Buinaksk in Dagestan said in a video posted by a local outlet.\n\n\"There are very few of us left at the frontlines. We have 151 employees, but only 41 received payments. Others got nothing.\"\n\nSimilar videos and open letters have surfaced in at least 20 out of 85 Russian regions in the past week, according to a CNN tally. In a public outcry, health workers complain they either did not receive any extra pay at all or got a fraction of it, calculated based on hours and even minutes spent working directly with Covid-19 patients.\n\n\"If the government decree initially stated clear, understandable, transparent and easily to control principles and ways to bring these presidential payments [to health workers] for working in special conditions, then there would be fewer questions for the head doctors who work from morning till night anyway, and to the governors too,\" Putin said Tuesday\n\nThe federal government amended the relevant decree, removing a bureaucratic loophole that resulted in some doctors receiving less than 50 cents of extra pay, and vowed to facilitate all due payments.\n\nIn the special meeting convened by Putin on Monday, officials acknowledged the situation in Dagestan is more serious than what's reflected in the official statistics. Russia's Health Minister Mikhail Murashko said that 7,000 people have been hospitalized. In Monday's video conference, the republic's Chief Mufti Ahmad Abdulaev told Putin many Covid-19 deaths are not recorded as people die in their homes without ever making it to a hospital and get buried according to local traditions -- and without an autopsy that could confirm cause of death.\n\nVladimir Vasilyev, the head of the republic, attributed the infection rates in part to Dagestan's traditions, which involve mass gatherings to mark milestone events such as weddings and funerals as well as a certain reluctance to suspend Friday prayers at the early stages of the outbreak. He also addressed the discrepancies in numbers between pneumonia and coronavirus.\n\n\"We are not hiding anything,\" Vasilyev said, citing the high number of respiratory-related deaths in 2018 and 2019, before coronavirus. \"But here it [is] not so easy to distinguish between the two.\"\n\nIn mid-April, the streets of the regional capital Makhachkala were still busy with people. Independent outlet Meduza described in a report last week how a 500-person wedding in one of Dagestan's small towns became one of the first coronavirus hotspots in late March. Still, some Dagestanis dispute speculation that their traditions are one of the causes of rising infections; Uvaisov, the local activist, cited distrust toward local authorities and the healthcare system for prompting some to disregard warnings.\n\nThe Kremlin has promised to help Dagestan with additional resources to help it fight the pandemic, including more test kits as the republic is still testing at a daily rate two times lower than recommended, according to federal healthcare and well-being agency Rospotrebnadzor. The agency's head, Anna Popova, told Putin that Dagestan is maintaining \"a very fragile balance,\" as authorities worry that the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Fitr and mass celebrations could prompt a new outbreak.\n\nRussia's overall coronavirus death toll remains low with 2,837 fatalities reported as of Tuesday and its mortality rate is 7.4 lower than the global average, according to Deputy Prime Minister Tatiana Golikova. The country's counting method has been scrutinized by observers who point out that deaths are often ascribed to other causes.\n\nRussian demographers and epidemiologists hope that nationwide statistics for April's all-cause mortality, expected to be released by the authorities late May, will help to get a clearer picture of the pandemic's toll on Russia -- both for coronavirus fatalities that might have been missed and for people who couldn't get medical help for other conditions due to overwhelmed hospitals.", "link": "https://us.cnn.com/2020/05/19/europe/coronavirus-russia-dagestan-intl/index.html", "published": "2020-05-19T00:00:00", "author": ["Mary Ilyushina"]}, {"title": "Trailblazing Paralympian Margaret Maughan dies aged 91", "text": "(CNN) Margaret Maughan, Great Britain's first Paralympic champion, has died at the age of 91.\n\nMaughan won the landmark gold medal in archery at the 1960 Paralympics in Rome and went on to compete at five more Games.\n\nShe was a strong advocate for the Paralympic movement and lit the cauldron during the opening ceremony of the 2012 Paralympics in London.\n\nFollowing a road accident in Malawi in 1959, Maughan was paralyzed from the waist down.

They're always asking about things to make for tea. They've definitely embraced the ritual,\" she said.\n\nSeabright said it's been a good opportunity to get the family together and build in time to relax during busy days juggling work and homeschooling with three kids under 10. She hopes they'll find a way to keep up their daily teatime once the children are back in school and daycare.\n\nA cup of tea makes everything better\n\nFor centuries, tea has been used for far more than quenching thirst. Around the world people drink it to relax, reinvigorate and soothe, and it's something we need now more than ever.\n\nIn the UK, where tea drinkers imbibe 100 million cups every day, according to the UK's Tea Advisory Panel, the beverage remains part of the national psyche \u2014 despite a growing preference for lattes, espressos and flat whites. The sentiment that a restorative cup of tea makes everything better still holds true.\n\nWith tea consumption growing around the world, the United Nations has designated May 21 the first ever \"International Tea Day.\"\n\nEven in the United States, long a coffee-dominated country, tea drinking is growing in popularity, with people consuming 0.4 kg (14 ounces) a year compared with 0.36 kg (12.7 ounces) in 2007 according to the United Nations, as people switch away from soda, milk and fruit drinks.\n\nScientists are beginning to look into just how tea might affect mood and cognition. Specifically, they're investigating whether it's relaxing and alerting effects are a direct biological outcome of the compounds in tea or whether they come from the context in which the drink is consumed \u2014 preparing your brew, choosing your favorite cup and sitting down for a brief respite from the world. Or both.\n\nGreen and black tea come from the same plant \u2014 Camellia sinensis. Green tea, however, is processed in a different way, which results in higher levels of some of the compounds that scientists believe have positive effects on our mental health.\n\nA British police officer hands a victim tea in the middle of the bombing wreckage during World War II.\n\nBrain boost\n\nDrinking green tea has been found to improve brain function in healthy people, said Stefan Borgwardt, chair and director of the department of psychiatry and psychotherapy at the University of L\u00fcbeck, Germany.\n\nIn a 2014 study, he gave green tea extracts equivalent to one or two cups of green tea to 12 healthy volunteers and imaged their brains to analyze changes in connectivity inside certain brain regions.\n\n\"We noticed an increased connectivity in regions of the brain associated with working memory,\" he said via email.\n\nAnd a 2017 review of more than 100 studies he coauthored found that green tea can impact the brain in three ways: It can influence psychopathological symptoms such as reducing anxiety; cognition by benefiting memory and attention; and brain function, specifically memory.\n\nThat review concluded that \"it would be desirable\" for more Westerners to consume at least 100 milliliters (3.3 fluid ounces) of green tea each day \"to protect neurocognitive function.\"\n\nHowever, Borgwardt cautioned that the effects aren't large, and current evidence is mainly provided by small-scale studies.\n\nDifferent compounds\n\nWhat's less clear is which compounds found in tea are responsible for various improvements in our brain power and whether they work alone or together.\n\nThe most important are antioxidants such as epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), the most abundant, followed by L-theanine, an amino acid found in tea leaves, and caffeine.\n\nBorgwardt said the benefits are likely not the consequence of a single component but linked to the presence of both caffeine and L-theanine.\n\nThere are also suggestions that tea could improve the symptoms of depression, dementia and Down's syndrome.\n\n2018 study conducted in South Korea found that frequent green tea drinkers were 21% less likely to develop depression over their lifetime than those who were non-drinkers. However, as an observational study, it couldn't establish cause and effect, only association.\n\nchanges in the brain's gray matter and, potentially, these effects of tea could be used to target psychiatric diseases such as depression and dementia. Borgwardt said that studies in animals have suggested that there arechanges in the brain's gray matter and, potentially, these effects of tea could be used to target psychiatric diseases such as depression and dementia.\n\nBut he noted that the research was at a very early stage, and that experimental studies should be confirmed by larger clinical trials before drawing any conclusions.\n\nNo harm\n\nGunter Kuhnle, an associate professor at the department of food and nutritional science at the University of Reading in the UK, researches the benefits of flavanols, which are found in tea, cocoa and some fruits.\n\nHe said one of the problems of assessing the benefits of tea and its beneficial compounds is that studies reporting effects are usually observational, reliant on subjective self-reporting and the impact of how food is prepared and consumed.\n\nWe need better data to truly assess the benefits of tea on our mental and physical well-being, with many differences in how it's consumed in different countries, Kuhnle said.\n\nIn the UK, he noted that tea is a typical working-class drink, whereas in the US it's a drink more commonly associated with higher status. So studies in the US may show a lot more benefits, but those could be due to socioeconomic background.\n\n\"I think most people thrive on rituals. It's a comforting thing.

Or is so much enforced proximity building stronger bonds between sisters and brothers?\n\nParents struggling to work while kids snarl insults and hurl objects at one another can be forgiven for thinking that it's the former scenario that's playing out while schools are closed as a result of Covid-19.\n\nBut with the distraction of friends, soccer and playdates an increasingly distant memory, some kids may be realizing that a sibling can, in fact, be a decent playmate, potentially strengthening a relationship that will support them throughout their lives.\n\nEarly findings from a study involving more than 500 families in the United Kingdom indicated that two-thirds of families reported stronger sibling relationships and fewer than one in five reported increased conflict, said Claire Hughes, a developmental psychology professor at the University of Cambridge's Centre for Family Research.\n\n\"There may be some really positive things that come from this,\" said Hughes, who is researching how family relationships are affected by stay-at-home orders and other coronavirus-related restrictions.\n\nThe parents with time to fill out an online questionnaire right now are likely to be the ones who have more resources, she added. But from the sample she had so far, \"the message we're getting is that siblings are stepping up and reconnecting with each other.\"\n\nThat's what Anna Blest, a London mother to three children, ages 6, 4 and 2, has been experiencing.\n\n\"I really did expect more rows. It hasn't been like the Waltons, but it's been more pleasant than I expected, given there's no other children or activities to leaven the mix,\" she said.\n\n\"It's them on their own. Boy, girl, boy. (My eldest) likes typical boy activities like football, but he's been at home playing really imaginative things. Staging a show and involving his sister. He's been kind.\"\n\nWhy siblings are important\n\nThere are three considerations to take into account when it comes to sibling relationships, which can help parents understand what's going on between brothers and sisters trapped at home with only each other for company.\n\nFirst, they're involuntary. We don't choose our siblings and as a result, \"there is an inherent love/hate dynamic,\" which means that \"interactions have a no-holds barred characteristic,\" Hughes said.\n\nSecond, they are the longest lasting of all our close relationships. Siblings are our fellow travelers. \"They will know you inside out, and this shared history can be really valuable when you are going through a crisis.\"\n\nThere's some research that has suggested sibling relationships are more influential than relationships with friends or one's own children for maintaining good health in old age.\n\nThree, they're incredibly important developmentally, even though sibling ties have often taken a back seat in debates around the importance of parents. They help children try out new social and emotional behavior, particularly when it comes to conflict, helping them learn ways to manage emotions, particularly negative ones, and develop awareness of other people's thoughts and feelings.\n\n\"They can withstand a lot of negativity. Things that wouldn't fly in a friendship. You would lose a friendship, but your sibling is there the next day,\" said Laurie Kramer, a professor of applied psychology at Northeastern University.\n\nIt's this dynamic that Nathalie Towner has seen play out during London's lockdown between her son, 11, and daughter, 6.\n\n\"The older one is usually all about his friends and is off to secondary school soon. He's frustrated, and the first and only available victim is his younger sister,\" she said.\n\n\"But when they're not goading each other it can work as well. He's played games with her he hasn't played in a long time \u2014 like hide and seek \u2014 that he wouldn't normally do.\"\n\nSibling relationships are also highly variable with huge differences as a result of age gaps, birth order and gender. Nor, it's important to note, is a sibling \"necessary or sufficient\" in life. It's not like only children are missing a bit,\" said Alison Pike, a professor of child and family psychology at the University of Sussex in the UK.\n\n\"It gives me pause when so many parents say I want my first born to have company. Sometimes it works out that way. Sometimes it doesn't.\"\n\nIn the same boat\n\nIn times of stress the natural tendencies of people get highlighted, Pike said, for good and bad.\n\n\"My kids are playing more together more than they ever had. But they are getting on each other's nerves more and fighting. It kind of exaggerates things across the board,\" Pike said.\n\n\"If you imagine a graph with ups and downs. I think it (the pandemic) exaggerates the ups and downs. You're going to see positive and negatives heightened,\" she added.\n\nPike thought the shared experience, whether it's the glee of unlimited screen time or dealing with your parents arguing more, could help forge closer bonds.\n\n\"We're not all in the same boat in this pandemic, but the person who is in the same boat is your sibling. And they are in your boat generationally as well,\" she said. \"It will be the story our children will tell their children when they complain about being bored.\"\n\nGood relationships often improve under difficult situations, with some siblings drawing closer, for example, during parents' divorce, said Jonathan Caspi, a therapist and professor in the department of family science and human development at Montclair State University in New Jersey.\n\nBut the reverse can be true \u2014 poor relationships can get worse.\n\n\"Spending so much time together, generally, makes for better relationships because you're forced to have to work through conflicts,\" he said.\n\nReset button?\n\nWith our kids' super-scheduled childhoods now on pause, parents can hit reset on the often neglected sibling relationship, Northeastern University's Kramer said.\n\n\"This is a great moment in history where we're at home, where parents can take advantage of this,\" Kramer added. \"How can we use this as a moment to get siblings to engage with each other more positively?\"\n\nInstead of parents asking each child what they want for breakfast, Kramer said one child could ask the other or guess what the sibling might want \u2014 helping them learn what Kramer called \"perspective taking.\"\n\nAnother suggestion as parents grapple with homeschooling is to find out what the older and the younger children could teach each other.\n\nand under.\" Other advice included finding activities where there is no winner or loser and kids have to cooperate to achieve a goal. She has created an online resource that can help encourage \"fun, friendly and low-conflict interactions\" between brothers and sisters ages 8and under.\" Other advice included finding activities where there is no winner or loser and kids have to cooperate to achieve a goal.\n\nHow to stay sane\n\nBut if the caterwauling and fights just won't stop, here are some tips on what you can do to stay sane and help kids get along.", "link": "https://us.cnn.com/2020/05/19/health/sibling-rivalry-pandemic-wellness/index.html", "published": "2020-05-19T00:00:00", "author": ["Katie Hunt"]}, {"title": "Severe storms, flooding and excessive heat make for a messy Memorial Day weekend", "text": "(CNN) Memorial Day weekend is in full swing, but if you're planning on going outside you might want to pack a poncho or umbrella.

It calls for an above average season, making the consensus even stronger that the US is headed for an active season.\n\nNOAA's official forecast calls for 13 to 19 named storms, six to 10 of hurricanes, and three to six major hurricanes (category 3 or higher). All of these numbers are above an average season of 12 named storms and six hurricanes.\n\nIf this year does end up being an above-average season, it will be the fifth year in a row. According to Gerry Bell, lead hurricane season forecaster with NOAA's Climate Prediction Center, this would break the previous record of four set back in 1998-2001.\n\nThis year the average forecast -- for all 13 groups that have submitted to Seasonal Hurricane Predictions -- is eight hurricanes and 17 named storms.\n\nTypically, these early forecasts vary a little bit more.\n\n\"In general, the consensus between seasonal hurricane forecasts this year is greater than it has been the past few years,\" says Phil Klotzbach, research scientist in the Department of Atmospheric Science at Colorado State University\n\nThe conditions look favorable for an active season\n\nThere are multiple ingredients that forecasters and forecast models consider when generating a seasonal hurricane forecast.\n\nOne is sea surface temperatures (SST). These sea surface temperatures are just one of the ingredients needed to fuel hurricanes. The warmer the ocean, the more fuel available for the storms to tap into.\n\n\"Sea surface temperatures across much of the Atlantic are running well above normal and have been for the past few months,\" Ward says. \"Since tropical systems feed off of warm sea surface temperatures, this could certainly lead to a more active 2020 Atlantic hurricane season.\"\n\n\"The current Atlantic sea surface temperature setup is consistent with active Atlantic hurricane seasons,\" says Klotzbach, \"with the notable exception of the far North Atlantic, which remains somewhat cooler than normal.\"\n\nAnother consideration is El Ni\u00f1o. When El Ni\u00f1o is present, it reduces Atlantic hurricane activity due to increased vertical wind shear -- changes in wind speed and direction with height that prevent hurricanes from building.\n\nAverage conditions or even La Ni\u00f1a conditions create a more favorable environment for tropical storm development.\n\nMost forecast models are pointing to neutral conditions or even La Ni\u00f1a conditions during the season.\n\nNOAA says the El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation is favored -- about a 60% chance -- to remain neutral through the summer. However, hurricane season includes all three of the fall months, so will the neutral conditions stay or change in the fall?\n\nAccording to the new NOAA release, the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) conditions are expected to either remain neutral or to trend toward La Ni\u00f1a, meaning there will not be an El Nino present to suppress hurricane activity.\n\nAlso, warmer-than-average sea surface temperatures in the tropical Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea, coupled with reduced vertical wind shear, weaker tropical Atlantic trade winds, and an enhanced west African monsoon all increase the likelihood for an above-normal Atlantic hurricane season. Similar conditions have been producing more active seasons since the current high-activity era began in 1995.\n\nThe outlier\n\nThere is one organization that is a slight outlier. The European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, or ECMWF, is forecasting a normal to a slightly above normal season.\n\nEveryone else is predicting an above average number of named storms this season.\n\nThe ECMWF seasonal hurricane forecast is derived from a count of vortices spun up by the model during the hurricane season, says Klotzbach.\n\n\"Different numerical models often agree on the overall situation, but differ in details of what they predict for drivers of hurricane variability,\" says Tim Stockdale, a principal scientist at ECMWF.\n\nEach of the forecasting groups uses different techniques to develop its forecast.\n\nOne computer model, called NCEP, is showing a strong La Ni\u00f1a development, and also very warm sea surface temperatures in the Gulf of Mexico. Anyone using this model in its forecast would likely predict a higher number of storms.\n\n\"The ECMWF model has weaker La Ni\u00f1a development, and sea surface temperature anomalies in the Atlantic are weaker, so both of these factors might give the ECMWF model a less-strong hurricane season than forecasts using NCEP inputs,\" Stockdale says, referring to the National Centers for Environmental Prediction.\n\nHe also notes that their calibration is based on 1993-2015, and does not take into account the last four years (2016-19), which have been more active.\n\nThose same years, the ECMWF has predicted fewer hurricanes ahead of the season than were observed.\n\nOne of the challenges this year is the sea surface temperatures globally, says Stockdale.\n\nThere are a lot of unusual anomalies, and it is uncertain how they will play together.\n\nTheir forecast computer model can integrate these anomalies in a way past models can't.\n\n\"On the other hand, the models still suffer from various tropical biases that mean we cannot be certain that their calculated responses will be correct,\" Stockdale says.\n\nThese forecasts groups have been producing hurricane forecast for decades\n\nEven though these forecasts aren't the official word from NOAA, they aren't something to pass off.\n\nA few of them have been issuing hurricane forecasts long before NOAA. Colorado State University has been doing seasonal projections the longest of any group.\n\n\"CSU started their seasonal hurricane forecasts in 1984,\" says Klotzbach. Of the groups submitting their outlooks to the Seasonal Hurricane Predictions website, the one with the longest track record of forecasts besides CSU is WeatherWorks , which started issuing predictions in 1992.\n\nThe Cuban Met Service started issuing seasonal forecasts in 1996. NOAA didn't start its seasonal forecasts until 1998.\n\nOther than Tropical Storm Risk , which also started in 1998, all other groups started their outlooks in 2000 or later.\n\nThey are likely correct but the forecasts could be wrong\n\nThere is a chance these forecasts could be wrong.\n\nFor example, if the tropical Pacific were to become warmer and the tropical Atlantic is colder than predicted, hurricanes would likely be fewer than anticipated. Alternatively, if a robust La Ni\u00f1a develops and the tropical Atlantic remains warmer than usual, the season could be even more active than these predictions suggest.\n\nThere is also a chance there is an active season and nothing hits the US coast.\n\n\"The best recent example of an extremely active season with no US hurricane landfalls is 2010,\" Klotzbach says. \"That year, we had 12 hurricanes in the Atlantic basin and zero US hurricane landfalls.\"\n\nClimatologically, about 30% of all Atlantic hurricanes make US landfall, he says.\n\nSo the odds of having 12 hurricanes and no US landfall is about 1 in 70.\n\n\"We always say that it only takes one big hurricane landfall to be a bad season,\" says Ward. \"So all coastal residents should certainly be paying close attention and have their hurricane plan ready for the upcoming season.\"", "link": "https://us.cnn.com/2020/05/21/weather/hurricane-season-2020-forecast-noaa/index.html", "published": "2020-05-21T00:00:00", "author": ["Allison Chinchar", "Judson Jones"]}, {"title": "A newborn has died of Covid-19 in South Africa", "text": "(CNN) A two-day-old baby has died of coronavirus-related condition in South Africa, the government said Thursday.\n\nThe baby was born preterm with lung difficulties and had to put on a ventilator, according to a statement from the health ministry.\n\n\"The mother had tested positive for COVID-19, and the child subsequently tested positive for COVID-19 as well.

But he has not detailed how it supposedly treats the virus or discussed potential side effects. His spokeswoman has not responded to CNN's request Wednesday for comment.\n\nAlong with a photo of himself sipping an amber-colored fluid from a bottle, Rajoelina announced last month that scientists from the country's research institute had developed Covid Organics, or CVO, to treat Covid-19. CNN's calls and emails this week to the Malagasy Institute of Applied Research have not been returned.\n\nCVO is made from the artemisia plant and other local Malagasy plants, the president said.

What might be the side effects that may be undesirable? What could be the dosing that needs to be adjusted?\"\n\nThe WHO country office has \"initiated\" a conversation with authorities in Madagascar to test and assess the tonic, officials said.\n\nThe race to find a treatment for the coronavirus has reignited interest in antimalarial drugs. Even US President Donald Trump had touted the antimalarial hydroxychloroquine as a potential treatment, though studies since then have shown it doesn't work against Covid-19 and could cause heart problems.\n\nEven as researchers the world over work feverishly toward a treatment for Covid-19, no country should simply promote the efficacy of an unproven remedy, said Charles Wambebe, professor of pharmacology at the Tshwane University of Technology , South Africa.\n\nIndependent validation with appropriate bodies is key, he said. Potential treatments, including traditional medicines, must pass safety, efficacy and quality checks, among other criteria before they can be accepted globally.\n\n\"If you're confident about the clinical and scientific studies you've done, then submit to a regulatory body for revalidation to give it more credibility,\" Wambebe told CNN.\n\nThe African Union has asked Madagascar to share technical and scientific data about the herbal infusion for review as leaders across the continent have expressed interest in using the drink, called Covid Organics, or CVO, to fight outbreaks.\n\nMadagascar has been giving out the tonic for free, and Equatorial Guinea, Chad and Guinea Bissau have gotten shipments, the island nation's president said. Nigeria said it had received samples of the product from Guinea Bissau and would first test and validate it.\n\n\"We will not put anything to use in Nigeria without the endorsement of our regulatory institutions,\" Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari said in a statement on Saturday.\n\nThe tonic also was distributed door-to-door for free across many regions of Madagascar after its unveiling last month, journalist Ga\u00eblle Borgia told CNN. It's now being sold in supermarkets and stores in the capital Antananarivo for 40 cents,1,500 ariary) and it's free for locals who can't afford it, Borgia said.\n\nBut WHO warned in its earlier statement May 4 that Artemisia annua and other medicinal plants must be \"tested to the same standards as ... the rest of the world.\"\n\n\"Even if therapies are derived from traditional practice and natural, establishing their efficacy and safety through rigorous clinical trials is critical,\" the agency wrote.\n\nRajoelina in an interview this week with France 24 slammed WHO's position and claimed 105 people have recovered from Covid-19 and those who did weren't treated with anything other than Covid-Organics. After someone is exposed to the virus, symptoms tend to appear within two to 14 days.\n\nStill, the President insisted the possibility of a treatment should not be ignored.\n\n\"You speak of proof; I spoke of war earlier,\" Rajoelina said when asked about evidence of his claim. He again did not share any further evidence of the tonic's efficacy or safety.\n\n\"When we are in this period of war, what is the proof we can show or give?\" he said. \"It is, of course, the healing of our sick.\"\n\nNo exception for clinical trial\n\nWHO is not opposed to countries developing research into potential treatments, but they must follow established scientific protocols and guidelines before any product can be recommended for wider use, said the agency's program manager for emergency response for Africa, Dr. Michel Yao.\n\n\"Instead of exporting it, like in the case of Madagascar, and having blanket statements about it, why don't we set up a clear protocol that is already on ground so we can have stronger evidence of its impact in this outbreak,\" Yao told CNN.\n\nIndeed, 70 traditional medicine experts who met virtually with the world health agency \"unanimously agreed that clinical trials must be conducted for all medicines in the Region, without exception,\" WHO Africa Region tweeted Tuesday.\n\nWHO has licensed dozens of herbal medicines for the treatment of other ailments and also matched traditional practitioners with research institutes to help their work, Yao said.\n\nResearchers are working on treatment options for Covid-19, and at least 110 potential vaccines are in development, according to WHO.", "link": "https://us.cnn.com/2020/05/15/africa/madagascar-coronavirus-herbal-remedy-who-intl/index.html", "published": "2020-05-15T00:00:00", "author": ["Bukola Adebayo"]}, {"title": "Midwives face fear and new challenges as the coronavirus spreads in Africa", "text": "(CNN) When midwife Philomena Owusu Domfe gets up for work every day she is scared.\n\nDomfe has been at the Ridge Hospital in Accra, Ghana's capital city, for eight years.

And when they do, pregnant women at the clinic are given different appointment times to limit the numbers.\n\nThe nurses also inquire about their travel history in addition to other routine checks.\n\n\"We check for their travel history so that if we suspect that the client may be a potential Covid-19 patient, then we place them in a holding center where samples will be taken and they will be tested for the virus,\" Domfe said.\n\nLike many other health care workers on the continent, midwives must use protective gear while attending to their patients.\n\nFatou Joof, who has worked as a midwife for 15 years in the Gambia, told CNN that she puts on gloves and wears her mask all the time. \"We are always using safety precautions ... we use masks, we hand-wash, we wear gloves,\" she explained.\n\nMidwife Fatou Joof examines a woman at the Serrekunda Health Centre.\n\nAs prescribed by the WHO, face masks can protect the wearer from large-particle droplets, and help prevent the spread of infection from the person wearing the mask to others.\n\nJoof works at the Serrekunda Health Center, 12 kilometers from the Gambian capital city, Banjul.\n\nWhile she worries about working as the virus has infected more than 90,000 health workers worldwide, she said she is comforted by the fact that she is protecting herself and saving lives.\n\n\"We cannot leave the mothers, we have to attend to them during antenatal and postnatal. I'm motivated to do this because I save lives. The lives of mothers,\" she said.\n\nInadequate handwashing facilities\n\nBut Joof may be one of the lucky ones. Many midwives do not have access to resources like clean water and soap needed to protect themselves from Covid-19.\n\nPatricia Mwenyeheri, a midwife in Malawi said there are only two handwashing basins at the Mzandu Health Center where she works.\n\n\"We have been provided with two handwashing facilities. The problem is that at the maternity ward, we have several departments which means that we need to have more of such hands-free facilities which are critical during this Covid-19 pandemic,\" she said in an interview with international charity WaterAid.\n\nPatricia Mwenyeheri uses one of the two hand basins at the health center where she works.\n\nWaterAid provided Mwenyeheri's health center with water connections for its toilets, handwashing basins, and bathrooms.\n\nMwenyeheri's department -- the maternity ward -- has access to only one of the handwashing basins, making it difficult to ensure washing of hands with soap and water as advised by the WHO.\n\n\"On average, we attend to more than 300 clients. So, having one handwashing facility for all of them is difficult to manage but we insist that everyone should wash their hands before we attend to them,\" she said.\n\nDelivering babies\n\nAccording to UNICEF, an estimated 116 million babies will be born under the shadow of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nJoof said she is worried about delivering babies during the pandemic because social distancing cannot apply at the point of delivery.\n\n\"You have to go close to the woman and deliver the baby so you protect yourself by washing your hands, putting on gloves, and using masks always,\" she said.\n\nDr. Daniel Roshan, an obstetrician-gynecologist based in the US, said in situations where the expectant mother has Covid-19, doctors and midwives should wear protective garments including overalls.\n\n\"If there is a patient known to have Covid-19 they can limit the exposure of health care workers in the labor room by using just one doctor and one nurse,\"' he told CNN.\n\nRoshan, who is also the founder of Rosh Maternal and Fetal Medicine , a center providing gynecological care, said mothers cannot transfer the virus to their newborns from the womb but can after delivery due to exposure.\n\nJUST WATCHED Nigerian citizen: I prefer to die from Covid-19 than hunger Replay More Videos ...

She should not be forced but she has to understand the risk that comes with that,\" he added.\n\nBut the work does not end with the birth of babies. Midwives and other health care workers have to teach new mothers how they can prevent themselves and their babies from contracting the virus.\n\nDomfe said she and her colleagues are telling new moms to discourage family members from holding their babies as visitors can also bring infections into the home.\n\nMothers also have to wash their hands thoroughly and maintain good hygiene while breastfeeding, she said.\n\nDomfe said working during the pandemic is overwhelming because there is a lot of adapting to do. But she stays motivated by reminding herself that she is helping hundreds of women through difficult times.\n\n\"I protect myself and pray to God to protect me,\" she said.", "link": "https://us.cnn.com/2020/05/13/africa/africa-midwives-coronavirus/index.html", "published": "2020-05-13T00:00:00", "author": ["Aisha Salaudeen"]}, {"title": "Africa's leaders forced to confront healthcare systems they neglected for years", "text": "(CNN) Africa's ailing presidents and powerful elites have been known to jet out to seek treatment abroad, instead of investing in healthcare in their own countries.\n\nNigeria's President Muhammadu Buhari was out of the country for several months in 2017 for treatment in London for an undisclosed illness and has frequent checks abroad. Since he took office in 2015, he has embarked on at least four medical trips to the UK.\n\nBut with flights grounded and countries across the world on lockdown in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, these leaders are getting a wake-up call that they must fix their healthcare systems.\n\n3. @StephanieBusari Cartoonists have caught on the joke. Nigerian politicians forced to use health facilities they refused to develop pic.twitter.com/lwjFpECu85\n\nThe President of the Commonwealth Medical Association , Osahon Enabulele, says while citizens have endured their leaders' frequent recourse to overseas medical treatment in the past, they may not remain so tolerantif the coronavirus wreaks havoc as it has elsewhere in the world.\n\n\"There is no place for any leader to hide anymore,\" Enabulele said. \"This whole situation of public office holders in Africa, most times using taxpayers' money to go on foreign medical trips at the slightest discomfort is one thing that will be reversed when this pandemic is over,\" Enabulele told CNN.\n\nA terrifying prospect\n\nacross the continent, while significantly lower than other parts of the world, are rising exponentially. The Infection numbersacross the continent, while significantly lower than other parts of the world, are rising exponentially. The World Health Organization recently reported that the number of cases in Africa was now more than 11,000, with 600 deaths.\n\nThe pandemic has overwhelmed advanced health facilities, and experts predict it could devastate the continent's fragile health systems, already plagued by inadequate funding and labor disputes.\n\nLifesaving machines like ventilators -- critical to the management of Covid-19 cases -- remain a luxury in some African countries.\n\nThe Central African Republic (CAR) has only three ventilators to five million people, the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) said, warning that an outbreak could bring the tiny African nation to its knees.\n\n\"When rich nations are in panic mode stating that thousands of ventilators will not be enough, it just brings to light how poorer nations like CAR don't stand a chance in the fight against Covid-19,\" NRC Country Director in the CAR, David Manan said.\n\nThe situation is equally dire in Zimbabwe, where health workers in the nation's hospitals say they lack basics such as bandages and gloves to take care of their patients.\n\nNurses and doctors abstained from work to protest a shortage of coronavirus protective gear after the country recorded its first fatality last month.\n\nUgandan popstar-turned-politician Bobi Wine told CNN the healthcare system in many African countries cannot handle a mass outbreak of Covid-19.\n\n\"I need to remind people that the coronavirus is more serious than they are already taking it. It is killing people in big numbers in Italy where there is a super health care system. So it scares me to even imagine what it can do in Africa if it comes in full effect,\" Wine said.\n\nWine said health care funding has not been at the forefront of government spending in many African countries because their leaders often seek treatment in hospitals abroad.\n\n\"It's clear that healthcare is not a priority for many African governments, and they put very little money into that sector. Anytime they are sick, or their children are having health conditions, they opt to go outside their countries,\" Wine said.\n\n\"Now the coronavirus pandemic has set a different ground for many African leaders. It has shown that they should have invested in the healthcare system of their countries which would have benefited them and the people in this crisis.\"\n\nThe lawmaker says monies spent on medical trips abroad could have been used to equip local hospitals with modern medical equipment such as ventilators, which have proved critical in treating some patients who have developed respiratory illnesses because of Covid-19.\n\nWine said some public hospitals in Uganda had become \"death traps\" due to years of neglect, and some citizens, including himself, have had to pay prohibitive costs for overseas treatment that could have been cheaper in Uganda.\n\nBetween 2019 and 2020, Uganda spent 8.9 percent of its national budget on health down from 9.2 percent from the previous fiscal year, according to UNICEF.\n\n\"I have had to spend my funds to seek advance treatment abroad because the procedure could not be provided in this country. But a majority of leaders in Uganda travel abroad for minor care using taxpayers money,\" Wine said.\n\nBut Uganda's health minister Jane Aceng told CNN Wine's assessment of the country's health system was not accurate.\n\n\"Uganda is doing well and that shows with our response to the coronavirus situation. We're doing well,\" she said.\n\nAceng added that she had all the resources needed to do her job.\n\nThe East African nation was one of the first African countries to impose travel and strict quarantine policies to prevent the spread of coronavirus even before it reported a case. It has so far reported 53 cases\n\nA failed pledge\n\nAfrican leaders have consistently neglected their country's health sector despite several pledges to do improve it, analysts say.\n\nIn 2001, the heads of state of 52 African countries met in Nigeria's capital, Abuja and committed to spending 15 percent of their yearly domestic budget on health.\n\nJust a handful of countries have met this target on the continent. They include Tanzania , Rwanda, Botswana and Zambia, according to the WHO.\n\nRwanda doubled it's health care spending over a period of 10 years, the WHO said in the 2017 report. The Central African nation has also received praised for its national health insurance coverage which is the highest on the continent\n\nBut a majority have fallen through the cracks in fulfilling this commitment.\n\nSince it signed the declaration, Nigeria has allocated less than six percent of its budget to health, and most of the funds are spent on salaries, according to Nigeria-based budget monitoring organization Budgit\n\nIn a paper published by the Brookings Institute , researchers said although Africa bore 23 percent of the world's disease burden in 2015, it accounted for only one percent of the global health spending for the same year.\n\n\"In per capita terms, the rest of the world spends 10 times more on health care than Africa,\" the researchers said.\n\nThe researchers predict it may be difficult for the countries on the continent to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals with a 2030 deadline with the \"current spending environment.\"\n\nWake-up call\n\nNigerian-British historian Ed Keazor agrees that the fallout from the outbreak is a \"wake-up call\" for governments to prioritize affordable health care.\n\nKeazor, a cancer survivor said he made the difficult decision to move back to London where he has access to affordable care under the National Health Service even though he works in Nigeria.\n\nThe filmmaker said he came to Lagos for a research and film festival in March but got caught in the city after the Nigerian government banned all international flights to contain the spread of the outbreak.\n\nKeazor says he's missed an appointment with his doctor in the UK due to the travel restriction, and that would not have been a problem if he could get the same quality of care locally.\n\n\"If I could get the same quality of care here (Nigeria) as in the UK where I'm a taxpayer and getting good medical services, I would rather stay back here because this is where my work and my larger family is but unfortunately, its not there,\" Keazor told CNN.\n\nFor now, he hopes the health crisis will change the Nigerian government's focus to where he says it should be.\n\n\"I hope the enormity of this problem has brought home the urgency of investment in health care infrastructure to the government and whatever the country looks like after this crisis is over, our priorities will be focused on heath care and education,\" he said.", "link": "https://us.cnn.com/2020/04/10/africa/african-leaders-healthcare-coronavirus-intl/index.html", "published": "2020-04-10T00:00:00", "author": ["Bukola Adebayo"]}, {"title": "Idris

I was shocked ... one of the men said I could choose my son and I did, but most of them were not happy with that option,\" she says, her gaze fixed on her husband's photograph as she recounted the ordeal.\n\n\"I am one of the humiliated widows,\" she added, rubbing her finger where her wedding band used to sit.\n\nFlora Alatan, Delta State Commissioner for Women Affairs, told CNN her department is working with the justice ministry to adopt the Violence Against Persons Prohibition Act (VAPP) , a federal legislation with a provision that directly punishes the ill-treatment of widows.\n\nThe \"Harmful Widowhood Practices\" in the VAPP Act says people can be jailed for a maximum of two years or pay a fine of N500,000 (around $1,366) for abusing women whose husbands have died.\n\nNigeria signed the VAPP Act in 2015, but a majority of the West African nation's 36 states are yet to adopt it and, consequently, the law can't be enforced in those states.\n\nWhile she's pushing for the law in her state, social workers from her ministry are also going into communities to encourage women to report such cases, Alatan said.\n\n\"We're not just speaking to the women, we are talking to their daughters. The education of the girl child is important if we want to put a stop to these inequalities,\" Alatan said.\n\nThis work is also personal for her.\n\nAlatan's husband died in February and she says her husband's extended family asked her to participate in some traditional rites for widows which she refused to do.\n\n\"I am presently mourning my husband and they told me there are some [cultural] or traditional things I must do. I told them that, 'No! I'll not bow to that and they cannot force me to do it.'\" Alatan told CNN.\n\nBut she admits her experience is not the reality of many women in the country and says that is why the adoption of the bill is urgently needed to put a stop to these practices.\n\n'Great deal of disadvantage'\n\nThere are 258 million widows around the world, according to UN estimates, and more than two million of them are in Nigeria, where 25% face a \"great deal\" of disadvantage and another 33% have experienced disadvantage, according to 2015 World Widows Report by the Loomba Foundation , a global NGO working with the UN to highlight the plight of widows.\n\nCNN has reached out to the office of the Nigerian minister for women affairs but has not received a response.\n\nHope Nwakwesi, who runs Almanah Hope Foundation , a support group where widows can share their stories safely, says family members who carry out this abuse are hardly ever arrested or prosecuted.\n\nHope Nwakwesi\n\nUntil the \"Harmful Widowhood Practices\" provision in the VAPP Act is enforced at the grassroots level, more women will face these forms of violence, she said.\n\n\"Government must realize that people hide under the name of culture to get vengeance on women,\" Nwakwesi said.\n\n\"What can be more humiliating than a woman shaving her pubic hair? Why should a woman be termed unclean because your husband is dead?\" she asked.\n\nNwakwesi herself became a widow 25 years ago after her husband was killed in a car accident.\n\nAfter his death, she was confined to a room for 28 days after which she was asked to shave her head as part of Ikwa Ozu, the mourning rites performed by widows in Anambra state in Nigeria's southeast.\n\n\"My head was scraped with a blade, and two days after it was like my head was on fire. I had to be using menthol and pouring ice cold water on my head for three weeks because it was so hot,\" said Nwakwesi, who is pushing for the practices to be abolished.\n\nHope Nwakwesi during her widowhood rites in 1994\n\nOn her return to Lagos, Nwakwesi says she and her four children were evicted from the apartment rented to them by her husband's employers.\n\nA few weeks later, she was suspended from the elementary school owned by the same employers, where she worked as a teacher.\n\n\"Our house was reallocated to another family. Under three months and at age 27, I went from being a wife to being a widow, with no house, job and with four children to care for,\" Nwakwesi, now, 52, told CNN.\n\nNwakwesi said she contemplated suicide at the time.\n\n\"It played out in my mind, the day my employers pasted my suspension letter on the school's notice board and as the pressure grew. I was overwhelmed ... I only snapped out of it because of my kids,\" she told CNN.\n\nShe is pushing for stronger laws she says will help \"catch a widow when she falls.\"\n\n\"One woman who has just lost her husband cannot fight her in-laws, but if she knows the law will back her up, she will fight back,\" Nwakwesi told CNN.\n\nNwakesi and her husband Obiora during their wedding in 1984\n\n'Horrendous and humiliating rites'\n\nIn 2005, the Anambra government signed the Malpractices Against Widows and Widowers (Prohibition) Law outlawing harmful mourning rites but researchers and Nwakwesi say the practice has still not stopped.\n\n\"Women in my group share the horrendous and humiliating rites they are forced to do, it is still happening but it must end,\" she said.\n\nAnambra has two laws criminalizing widowhood rites, says Ndidi Mezue, the states' commissioner for women and children affairs, but its enforcement has been slow.\n\nWidows who have been abused don't often report such cases to authorities for fear of backlash from their community.\n\n\"That is why we have social welfare workers going to communities to pick cases and also educate the women about their rights and the laws,\" Mezue told CNN.\n\nIn some communities in southern Nigeria, traditional leaders have begun calling on their subjects to stop these practices.\n\nBut many widows are still pressured by their in-laws to perform the rites.\n\nNigerian women from poor backgrounds are more likely to suffer physical abuse, compared to those from wealthy homes, according to Nwakwesi, and this discrimination against vulnerable women only makes her \"more angry.\"\n\n\"There is this school of thought in this widow practice. Those they dare and those they can't. Do the high and mighty in Nigeria, who come from my area agree to do this? They don't and no one has the audacity to stand up to them,\" Nwakwesi said.\n\nPhysical abuse and disinheritance from families are among the many inequalities that women in Nigeria, and most of Africa, face after their spouses' death\n\nSociety has not been kind to them either.\n\nAfrican women are often excluded from social and economic plans -- safety nets they desperately need -- after the death of a spouse or dissolution of a marriage, experts from the World Bank said in a 2018 report\n\nNwakwesi, now a school proprietor in an upscale neighborhood in Lagos, said she had plans to grow her business after her husband's death but she had no means to source the funds.\n\nOver the years, she's also counseled and assisted widows after they were denied small business loans because they were not married.\n\n\"People think you won't be able to repay because now you are the only one bearing the responsibilities, but economic empowerment is one way to put a woman back on (her) feet,\" Nwakwesi said.\n\nFight for women's rights\n\nChinyere Anokwuru, who runs a skills acquisition center for women in Lagos, says women are usually the custodians of traditions that repress widows and their re-orientation is critical to abandoning these practices.\n\n\"The older widows believe that they have gone through these practices and believe others must go through the same thing,\" Anokwuru told CNN.\n\nAt the Lagos-based center, widows are being taught about women's and property rights. They are being empowered to speak up against the practices in their communities.\n\n\"We are speaking at town hall meetings, telling village chiefs and widows to say no when another widow is told to sit on the floor for seven days wearing black cloth because she's lost her husband,\" she said.\n\nFor Rose, it's been three years since her husband passed away and she's still putting pieces of her life back together.\n\nShe says it's been difficult raising funds to revive her clothing business and she now runs a local restaurant in Abule Egba, a densely-populated neighborhood in downtown Lagos.\n\nMen are not subjected to these forms of rituals when their wives die. It is still a form of discrimination against women. Rose\n\nWhat profit she makes is only enough to pay her rent and keep her family going. But her husband's death has given her a new meaning beyond her material needs, she said.\n\nInstead of attending social functions on weekends -- which is what she used to do when she had her fabric store -- Rose volunteers at a women's advocacy group in the area.\n\nWhen a woman's husband has just died in the community, Rose is one of the people they call on for advice.\n\n\"I tell them the hell I went through, to let them know they don't have to go through these rites. They should just reject it,\" Rose said.\n\nThe fight for the abolition of widow rites should be seen as a fight for women's rights, she added.\n\n\"Men are not subjected to these forms of rituals when their wives die. It is still a form of discrimination against women.\"", "link": "https://us.cnn.com/2020/03/27/africa/as-equals-nigeria-widow-rites-intl/index.html", "published": "2020-03-27T00:00:00", "author": ["Bukola Adebayo"]}, {"title": "This animated monster is teaching children in Nigeria -- and around the world -- about coronavirus", "text": "\" Covid Heroes and Newsmakers \" is a weekly social media series featuring live interviews with African heroes serving their communities and newsmakers driving strategy as the continent faces Covid-19.

Habeeb gets bored of staying indoors and tries to sneak out of the house to play soccer. He is warned by his sister, who tells him about coronavirus and its dangers.\n\n\"You can get the deadly coronavirus. Do you know what will happen when you do? You will bring the coronavirus home and then infect everyone. Mummy will be sick; no more jollof rice.

The confrontation makes him realize the need to stay indoors. The cartoon also explains the importance of washing one's hands thoroughly\n\nSome of Nigeria's states including Lagos, its commercial center, and Abuja, the capital city, have been on lockdown since March 30.\n\nAkinmolayan, who has directed hit Nollywood movies like \" The Set Up ,\" \" Chief Daddy \" and \"The Wedding Party 2,\" said he was inspired to create the coronavirus cartoon as he struggled to explain the need for lockdowns to his 5-year-old son.\n\n\"You want to tell your child not to go outside, but you need to explain why he needs to stay inside. Beyond that, you need to explain why he constantly has to wash his hands with soap and water. ... It was really hard until I came up with the idea of the coronavirus monster,\" he told CNN.\n\n\"I explained that the monster will take Mummy and Daddy and there would be no more ice cream and great food,\" he added. \"And that was when it occurred to me that a lot of parents were probably facing the same challenge.\"\n\nCreating the coronavirus monster\n\nAkinmolayan made the short through his Lagos-based production company, Anthill Studios. His crew worked on it from their homes and opted for animation so everyone could practice social distancing, he said.\n\n\"I figured out that one of the best ways to explain it (coronavirus) was with graphics and animations so that we wouldn't have real people gather in one place to film,\" he said.\n\nThe cartoon is being distributed for free. Made in English and the Nigerian languages of Yoruba, Hausa, and Igbo, it has been translated to French, Swahili and Portuguese and shared widely on some broadcast TV stations, Akinmolayan said.\n\n\"I created a Google Drive and put all the videos there, including the soundtrack and made it public,\" he said. \"I said anyone could record a language over it or just do a subtitle. Some guys in Ivory Coast did a French version, guys in East Africa did a Swahili version. I stumbled on the Brazilian one. It was on Turkey's national television and on TV in China, too.\"\n\nCountering misinformation\n\nSeparate from the coronavirus monster, Akinmolayan and his team created an animation that answers the most frequently asked questions about coronavirus, which has infected 1,700 people in Nigeria as of late Wednesday, with 51 deaths recorded, according to the West African nation's center for disease control.\n\n\"There was so much misinformation out there, a lot of false news. I realized that it was because people didn't understand what the virus was about. I figured out that one of the best ways to explain it was with graphics and animations,\" he said.\n\nIt's 1 minute, 47 seconds long and uses infographics to explain the need to wash hands with soap, maintain social distance and stay indoors. It also explains how the virus can be contracted and details symptoms like cough, high temperature and difficulty breathing.\n\nThe video relies on credible sources like the World Health Organization, Akinmolayan said, and has been recreated in French, Portuguese and Swahili and widely shared in countries like Brazil, Kenya and China.\n\n\"I also noticed that all the messages been disseminated were in English and that was why it was easy to flood WhatsApp with wrong information,\" he explained. \"It was being shared by parents and grandparents who probably didn't care about the Big English.\"\n\nNollywood and animations\n\nNigeria's movie industry is worth 239 billion naira (about $612 million), producing large numbers of films every year.

Hide Caption 1 of 18 Photos: Journey to the other side in style The roots \u2013 According to legend, the first abebuu adekai was created in the 1950s when a \"palanquin\" carriage was made for a tribal leader in the shape of a cocoa pod. But the leader died suddenly, and quick-thinking subjects buried him in the pod.\n\n\n\nThis inspired young carpenter Seth Kane Kwei to establish his own novelty coffin studio in the town of Teshie, and the The Kane Kwei Carpentry Workshop (above) remains popular to this day.

Even the people who have already brought cloths for me to sew have not returned to pick them up, said Maryam. She understands why, though. \"If this is what it takes to stop the spread of this coronavirus, I am okay.\"\n\nFor now, she prefers her clients to stay at home because she feels more protected from contracting the virus herself, but it will only be a matter of time before funds run dry, she added.\n\nA stray from traditional customs\n\nShaking hands with the family of the deceased is a deep-rooted tradition in many Ghanaian tribes that has taken place for hundreds of years and has become a mandatory part of ceremonies to show respect for the dead, says Queen Naa Tsotsoo Soyoo I, a Ghanaian Queen mother, who forms part of a powerful group of traditional women leaders.\n\nShe explained how significant the ban on mass funeral gatherings has affected the customs of such ceremonies.\n\n\"A significant part of funerals is bringing families together to embrace through handshakes, hugs and to mourn in close proximity of one another,\" said Queen Naa.\n\n\"The immediate implication of what is now taking place is that families will be unable to connect.

But this time they are better disguised and more targeted, harder to identify and track. And they have found an unlikely home, far from Russia itself.\n\nIn 2016, much of the trolling aimed at the US election operated from an office block in St. Petersburg, Russia. A months-long CNN investigation has discovered that, in this election cycle, at least part of the campaign has been outsourced -- to trolls in the west African nations of Ghana and Nigeria.\n\nThey have focused almost exclusively on racial issues in the US, promoting black empowerment and often displaying anger towards white Americans. The goal, according to experts who follow Russian disinformation campaigns, is to inflame divisions among Americans and provoke social unrest.\n\nThe language and images used in the posts -- on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram -- are sometimes graphic.\n\nOne of the Ghanaian trolls -- @africamustwake -- linked to a story from a left-wing conspiracy website and commented on Facebook: \"America's descent into a fascist police state continues.\"\n\nAn image from a now-deleted Facebook page of one of the trolls touted alleged police targeting of African Americans.\n\nReferring to a Republican state senator, the post continued: \"Someone needs to take that Senator out.\"\n\nOn another occasion, @africamustwake tweeted: \"YOU POLICE BEEN KILLING BLACKS SINCE YA RAGGEDY MOMMAS GAVE BIRTH TO U. HAPPY MLK DAY TO U HYPOCRITES.\"\n\nMore than 200 accounts were created by the Ghanaian trolls -- the vast majority in the second half of 2019 -- and they reached hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions, of people worldwide.\n\nFacebook and Twitter had already been looking into some of the troll accounts when CNN notified the two companies of our investigation. In a statement Thursday, Facebook said that its \"subsequent assessment benefited from our collaboration with a team of journalists at CNN\" and it had \"removed 49 Facebook accounts, 69 Pages and 85 Instagram accounts for engaging in foreign interference.\"\n\nFacebook said: \"This network was in early stages of audience building and was operated by local nationals -- witting and unwitting -- in Ghana and Nigeria on behalf of individuals in Russia. It targeted primarily the United States.\"\n\nFacebook says that about 13,200 Facebook accounts followed one or more of the Ghana accounts and around 263,200 people followed one or more of Instagram accounts, about 65% of whom were in the US.\n\nTwitter told CNN that it had removed 71 accounts that had 68,000 followers. \"Most were tweeting in English and presented themselves as based in the United States,\" it said in a statement. \"The accounts -- operating out of Ghana and Nigeria and which we can reliably associate with Russia -- attempted to sow discord by engaging in conversations about social issues, like race and civil rights.\"\n\nThe activity uncovered by CNN had striking similarities to the Russian troll campaign of 2016, which created hundreds of accounts designed to pass as American. @africamustwake, for example, which described itself as a \"Platform For #BLM #Racism #PoliceBrutality,\" claimed to be in Florida.\n\nOther accounts, for example, claimed to be in Brooklyn or New Orleans.\n\nOne of the accounts even pretended to be the cousin of an African American who died in police custody. The post was then shared to a Facebook group called Africans in the United States. The group told CNN it had no idea that trolls were trying to engage it.\n\nAnother also implied they were in the US, tweeting in February: \"Just experienced blatant #racism in Downton (sic) Huntsville, Alabama ... Three of my black male friends were turned away because they were 'out of dress code.'\"\n\nThere was a concerted effort to agitate in the US. One of the trolls -- Black People Trendz -- posted to the Facebook page of Black Lives Matter in Cincinnati. Another -- @The_black_secret -- was devoted to police shootings of African Americans. It also posted a video of a racial incident with the comment \"Blacks have a right to defend themselves against Racism\" that drew more than 5,000 reactions and more than 2,000 shares.\n\nCNN worked with two Clemson University professors -- Darren Linvill and Patrick Warren -- in tracking the Ghanaian operation. Linvill said the campaign was straight out of the Russian playbook, trying to mask its efforts among groups in the US.\n\n\"They were very closely engaged in the Black Lives Matter community,\" he said. \"They talked almost exclusively about what was happening on the streets of the United States and not on the streets of Africa.\"\n\nKailee Scales, managing director of Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation, said her organization was proactive when it came to protecting its voice online. \"We are walking into the 2020 election cycle with eyes wide open to the fact that international and domestic actors are striving to undermine our organizing, and we are not going to let that happen,\" she told CNN.\n\nInside the troll farm\n\nThe operation's headquarters were in a walled compound in a quiet residential district near the Ghanaian capital, Accra. It had been rented by a small nonprofit group that called itself Eliminating Barriers for the Liberation of Africa (EBLA).\n\nThis building was used as the headquarters for Ghanaians posing as Americans and posting on social media.\n\nSixteen Ghanaians, mostly in their 20s, worked at the compound; some lived rent-free in a nearby apartment. They were issued mobile phones, not laptops, and worked around a table. The EBLA trolls communicated as a group through the encrypted Telegram app, which is rarely used in Ghana.\n\nOne of the trolls agreed to talk to CNN, so long as her identity was disguised. She said she had no idea she would be working as a Russian troll. She said that employees were given topics to post about. \"So you get stories about LGBT, you get stories about police brutality, depends on what you are working,\" she said.\n\nEmployees would sit at this table to create posts and tweets on their phones, one worker told CNN.\n\nThe employee said they were told that the best time to tweet and post was late afternoon and at night in Ghana, times when a US audience would have been active. They were given US articles to read.\n\nFacebook said that although the people behind the campaign had attempted to conceal their purpose and coordination, its investigation had found links to both EBLA and \"individuals associated with past activity by the Russian Internet Research Agency.\"\n\nThe Internet Research Agency (IRA) was responsible for much of the foreign trolling activity aimed at the 2016 and 2018 US election campaigns, according to the US government. The IRA was funded by Russian oligarch Yevgeny Prigozhin, who is so close to the Kremlin that he is nicknamed \"Putin's chef.\"\n\nYevgeny Prigozhin, in Moscow in 2017, funded the 2016 IRA trolling.\n\nA CNN request for comment from Prigozhin's holding company, Concord Management, on the Ghana trolling operation went unanswered.\n\nThe man running EBLA calls himself Mr. Amara and claims to be South African. In reality he is a Ghanaian who lives in Russia and his name is Seth Wiredu. Several of EBLA's workers said they had heard Wiredu speak Russian.\n\nLate last year, Wiredu extended EBLA's activities to Nigeria, filling at least eight positions, including a project manager to help with \"social media management.\" CNN uncovered the postings for two of the jobs, and a source in Nigeria confirmed that the employees shared office space in Lagos. The Nigerian accounts posted predominantly on US issues too.\n\nAnd at the end of January this year, EBLA ventured even further afield. It advertised a position in Charleston, South Carolina, just as the IRA had done in 2016. The LinkedIn posting invited applicants to \"join hands with our brothers and sisters world-wide, especially in the United States where POC are mostly subjected to all forms of Brutality.\"\n\nThe posting on LinkedIn stopped accepting applications days later.\n\nEBLA had a website touting its advocacy work, but CNN found the photos had likely been uploaded by someone using a Cyrillic keyboard, unusual outside of Russia.\n\nOn February 6, Ghanaian security services raided the EBLA compound. On that same day the group stopped posting on the social media accounts it had created. One of the workers told CNN they were told to lie on the ground and had guns pointed at them. They were interrogated by police and the phones used to post on the fake accounts were confiscated.\n\nWhen CNN visited the compound two weeks later, it appeared to have been abandoned.\n\nIn a statement to CNN, the Ghanaian security services said their Cyber Security Unit had become suspicious of EBLA's activities and believed it was engaged in \"organized radicalism with links to a foreign body.\" They added that they had determined that \"EBLA receives its funding from an anonymous source in a European country.\"\n\nGhanaian security sources subsequently told CNN that all of EBLA's funding had come from Russia.\n\nWiredu does not seem to have been deterred by the raid. Early in March, he called a meeting of EBLA workers. CNN observed the meeting from close by.\n\nSeth Wiredu, seen here in a frame from a hidden camera video, said he had no idea why his offices were raided by Ghanaian security forces.\n\nWiredu told the workers, whom he met in several groups, that the trouble with the security services would soon pass, according to someone at the meeting. He told them they would be returning to work and should create new accounts, providing him with the passwords.\n\nApproached by CNN after the meeting, Wiredu denied he had ever worked for the Internet Research Agency or knew Prigozhin.\n\n\"I wouldn't say I have Russian partners. I have friends ... but to call them partners wouldn't be right because I don't ask someone to come and support me,\" he said. He said he did translation work for many entities in Russia.\n\nWiredu insisted he funded EBLA from his own income and did not understand why the Ghanaian security forces had raided the compound. He said the accounts had been \"talking about what is important to black people, talking about racism, talking about police brutality.\"\n\n\"I actually, I perceive myself as a blacksfighter. I fight for black people,\" Wiredu added.\n\nWiredu acknowledged that he had called himself Amara and pretended to be South African.\n\nEBLA's targets in the US followed a long-established pattern, according to Linvill and Warren at Clemson, who work with US law enforcement in tracking trolling activities.\n\nClemson professors Darren Linvill, left, and Patrick Warren often see new fake accounts replacing any that are shut down.\n\n\"There's a long history, actually dating back to the Soviet Union, of Russia emphasizing the real and serious racial divisions that exist in the United States. But also trying to inflame those divisions,\" Warren said.\n\nThis building in St. Petersburg, Russia, became known as the \"troll factory.\"\n\nThree months later, Facebook removed 70 Facebook and 65 Instagram accounts -- as well as 138 Facebook Pages -- that were controlled by the IRA. Facebook also took down other Russian operations not linked to IRA in 2018.\n\nCNN's investigation found the accounts created in Ghana were consistently coordinated, posting on the same topic within hours of each other. Instagram accounts appear to have done especially well: the most popular Instagram account built a following of more than 25,000, three times its Twitter audience.\n\nOne EBLA-branded image was retweeted by a Twitter account with 126,000 followers, greatly amplifying the group's message.\n\nWiredu closely monitored the impact of the expanding operation, according to several EBLA employees who spoke to CNN. One of them said they provided their passwords to him and every week had to report details of the reach of their accounts. They used Twitter analytics to examine their growth and were told they would get bonuses and higher pay if their accounts grew significantly.\n\nSome of the trolls' posts incorporated video with the EBLA logo burned in. The @AfricaMustWake Twitter account posted a video in December carrying the EBLA logo, showing alleged police brutality in Chicago.\n\nIn November, another account -- @AfricaThen -- posted an EBLA-labeled video with the caption: \"A female white supremacist went into a Popeyes using the N-word at the employees.. and she ended up getting a Grand Slam breakfast #Racism #kickitout #CHANGE.\"\n\nWhat's next in Ghana -- and elsewhere\n\nIt's unclear whether Wiredu will succeed in reconstituting the EBLA operation after the February raid. He certainly intends to try, according to one of the EBLA workers, who told CNN that he had encouraged them to begin new accounts.\n\nTo the Clemson researchers, building troll networks in Ghana and Nigeria would be smart tradecraft. \"It's definitely spreading out the risk,\" Linvill said. \"You can have accounts operating from entirely different parts of the globe and it might make your operation harder to identify overall.\"\n\nMore broadly, Russia has certainly shown growing interest in Africa -- using a mix of state power and private interests. Those private interests include Russian companies keen to exploit Africa's energy and commodity resources, as well as provide private military contractors to bolster local security forces.\n\nA CNN investigation last year found that companies linked to Prigozhin were active in the Central African Republic , training its army and police forces and winning concessions to extract diamonds and gold. Prigozhin companies or contractors have also been present in Libya, Sudan and Mozambique.\n\nThey have also tried to influence the politics of several African countries.\n\nLast October, Facebook closed networks of accounts that were actively targeting a total of eight African countries. It said that: \"Although the people behind these networks attempted to conceal their identities and coordination, our investigation connected these campaigns to entities associated with Russian financier Yevgeny Prigozhin.\"\n\nRussia has shown increasing interest in Africa, including in Accra, Ghana, where these fishing boats sit.\n\nRussia's continuing interest in Africa as a platform for expanding its influence has taken on a new complexion with the trolling enterprise in Ghana -- demonstrating an adaptability and persistence that will cause deep concern among US intelligence agencies and the technology companies.\n\nUS Sen. Mark Warner, vice-chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said in response to CNN's reporting: \"I've said for years now that it would be foolish to believe there was only the one well-publicized IRA facility in St. Petersburg. This new reporting is a reminder of the continuing threat we face from Russia and its continuing efforts to divide and manipulate us on social media.\"\n\nLinvill, the Clemson professor, believes that despite their work and the CNN investigation there are many more troll accounts out there. He recalls that last year he turned over to Twitter a number of fake Ghanaian accounts. Twitter suspended them. \"But a week later, there was another set of accounts to replace them.\"\n\nJournalist Manasseh Azure Awuni in Ghana, CNN's Stephanie Busari in Nigeria and CNN's Darya Tarasova in Russia contributed to this story, which was reported from Accra, Ghana; London; Moscow; Lagos, Nigeria, and Clemson, South Carolina.

This project is the first part of a conversation around inclusion. We are helping map out Makoko so that governments and other organizations can provide interventions and access to social services like electricity, healthcare, and education.\" Ottaviani told CNN.\n\nMass demolitions\n\nIn recent years, authorities in Nigeria have embarked on mass demolitions of prime waterfront slums citing safety and security concerns.\n\nRights activists, who fiercely oppose the decision, say the evictions are carried out often to appease property developers and to create luxury urban dwellings.\n\nMore than 30,000 families in Otodo Gbame were left with nowhere to live after they were forcibly evicted, a decision that was ruled unconstitutional by a Lagos High Court in 2017, although many of those who lost their homes are still awaiting justice.\n\nAccording to Megan Chapman of Justice and Empower Initiative (JEI) the government does not have the right to evict residents from their communities without due process.\n\n\"A part of due process in an eviction process is making plans from compensation and resettlement. These communities are evicted without alternatives and the residents are expected to disappear, like they never existed,\" Chapman said.\n\nBenjamin Aide is the administrator of a primary school - Makoko Dreams, which provides free education to over 200 children in the community.\n\nAide has also joined the local mapping team to put other landmarks in the community on the map. \"I like the maps. It will show the world that we are here and make the government look at how they can help us develop this place.\" Aide says.\n\nBut there are fears that the mapping project, while desirable, could attract unwanted attention and leave Makoko vulnerable to new eviction attempts.\n\nRather, they hope it will spur the authorities into action to assist them in development plans for Makoko.\n\n\"We hope this thing will help the government see that we are here and we are a lot of people that have been fending for ourselves for generations,\" Panke tells CNN.\n\nInformal slums\n\nDespite its status as the fifth largest economy in Africa, the wealth in Lagos remains stubbornly concentrated in the hands of a very few.\n\nMore than half of Nigeria's residents live in slum settlements, according to the 2015/2016 Slum Almanac . Nigeria's population, according to the US Census Bureau is growing at a rate of 3.2% a year and is estimated will be at more than 400 million people in 2050.\n\nAccording to the UN-Habitat report from the United Nations Millennium Development Goals database, the population of Nigerians living in informal slums in urban areas has dropped to 50.2 percent from 77.3 percent in 1990.\n\nFishermen and women on a waterway in the Makoko on March 2, 2019.\n\nMakoko is one of many settlements provides cheap housing alternatives for urban dwellers.\n\n\"We have asked that the government come help us out by providing healthcare, electricity, and schools, but we have not heard back from them on anything,\" Panke says.\n\nAn untapped community\n\nThe mapping project presents a lifeline for the people of Makoko.\n\nOttaviani, who is leading the project hopes the maps will help the government understand the social-economic need of residents in the community.\n\n\"Makoko has been untapped by the government and this means there is a lot of potential in trade, taxes, and development for the community and for the government.\"\n\nFor Hounkpe, the project has been an opportunity to learn about maps, drones, and her community, but it is a lot more.\n\n\"With this mapping project, I know I am fighting for my life and the lives of other people like me in Makoko.", "link": "https://us.cnn.com/2020/02/26/africa/nigeria-makoko-mapping-intl/index.html", "published": "2020-02-26T00:00:00", "author": ["Oluwatosin Adeshokan", "For Cnn"]}, {"title": "Senegal launches wind power plant as part of its commitment to renewable energy", "text": "(CNN) As part of its plan to push for more renewable energy, Senegal inaugurated what it describes as West Africa's largest wind power plant on Monday.\n\nThe zero-emissions power plant will supply up to 15% of Senelec's energy production.

According to Bessa, EntoMilk has \"a slightly earthy undertone\" and gives the ice cream \"a rich, creamy taste.\"\n\nBut it's not just about the taste -- Bessa says insect ice cream is also high in nutrients. According to Gourmet Grubb EntoMilk is five times higher in protein than dairy.\n\nAccording to the UN, it is widely accepted that insects provide nutrients that are comparable to meat and fish.\n\n\"Insects are inherently high in fat and protein and minerals,\" said Bessa. \"The black solider fly has protein and fat content comparable to beef, and zinc, iron and calcium that are much higher than that of beef.\"\n\nEntoMilk is also lactose-free and gluten-free, and unlike dairy milk it does not contain any carbohydrates or sugars.\n\nEnvironmentally friendly\n\n\"We decided to focus on an industry [food] that is under a lot of pressure due to animal welfare and environmental concerns,\" said Bessa. \"Insects aren't sentient beings, and they only grow in the conditions in which they thrive, so the farming conditions cater to their animal welfare needs.\"\n\nEntoMilk is a dairy alternative made from insects. It is full of nutrients and environmentally friendly to farm and produce.\n\nAccording to Gourmet Grubb, liter for liter , EntoMilk is more water and energy efficient to produce than any dairy milk or dairy milk alternatives.\n\n\"Insects need very little water, feed and space to grow,\" Bessa explained. \"They also produce little/no greenhouse gases compared to traditional livestock.\"\n\nBecause insects can be farmed indoors in small, controlled environments they can be reared in urban areas, reducing the impact of transporting the milk to the city. It also means they are less at risk of being impacted by external climate patterns, which would affect cattle and crops.\n\nThere is also potential for insect farming to reduce waste.\n\n\"Some insects, like the black solider fly larvae, have the ability to feed on a wide range of organic matter,\" said Bessa. \"For example, the spent grain left over from brewing beer is used to feed the larvae.\"\n\nThe future of food?\n\nCurrently, Gourmet Grubb's ice cream is only distributed in South Africa, but the global edible insects market is predicted to reach $1.2 billion by 2023.\n\nAs well as ice cream, Gourmet Grubb helps develop savoury dishes. These are polenta fries made with mopani worm powder.\n\nLast month, Gourmet Grubb also opened a concept popup store, which included savory insect dishes such as insect powder pasta, chickpea black-larvae croquettes and mopani worm hummus, to serve alongside its ice cream.\n\n\"We need to find alternatives that will be able to sustain the growing population and create a sustainable and environmentally friendly farming system,\" said Bessa.\n\n\"The only way EntoMilk can truly make a difference and reduce the pressures of traditional dairy is if it is accepted and consumed on a global scale.\"", "link": "https://us.cnn.com/2019/07/25/business/gourmet-grubb-insect-ice-cream-intl/index.html", "published": "2019-07-25T00:00:00", "author": ["Stephanie Bailey"]}, {"title": "This iced tea is harnessing South Africa's miracle plant", "text": "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger.

She was the eighth female to be murdered there in two years.\n\nNearly a year after the teen was killed, police arrived at the house of a 22-year-old repairman, just as he was about to eat dinner.\n\n\"What's this about?\" Yoon, whose full name is not being published due to a South Korean law that protects the privacy of suspects and criminals, remembers asking. \"It won't take long,\" he says police replied.\n\nThe officers took him to a small interrogation room with a single table at the local police station where they questioned him for three days about the 13-year-old's rape and murder. Eventually, they extracted a confession.\n\nYoon told police that on the night of the murder, he had gone for a walk to get some air, according to records of his confession obtained from his attorney. During the walk, he had to stop several times to rest -- his childhood polio had left him with a limp so bad that he had been exempted from compulsory military service. Around midnight, Yoon saw a house with a light on and felt a sudden \"urge for rape,\" he told police, according to transcripts of his confession. He climbed into the house and attacked the young girl, although he told police he knew the parents were asleep next door.\n\nAfterward, he burned his clothes and went home, according to the confessions.\n\nLittle is known about the girl and her family, who have never spoken to media.\n\nYoon's story is somewhat clearer: He was convicted of raping and murdering the 13-year-old girl and sentenced to life in prison, though his sentence was later reduced on appeal. He was released after 20 years in prison.\n\nThe problem is, Yoon says he didn't do it.\n\nWhere everyone knows everyone\n\nBefore 1986, Hwaseong wasn't the sort of place where violent crime happened. About 226,000 people lived in the area, scattered among a number of villages between forested hills and rice paddies.\n\nOne of those villages was Taean-eup, where Yoon lived. In the 1980s, Taean-eup was a bustling community with rice-wine bars and Korean-style coffee shops where locals liked to gather and gossip. Many people worked in the nearby factories, many of which created electrical goods, such as light bulbs, remembers Hong Seong-jae, who ran the farming machine repair store where Yoon worked. Others worked as rice farmers, and even those who lived downtown kept cows for milk. Everyone in Taean-eup knew each other, Hong said. Before the murders, there was no real crime to speak of -- only the odd robbery or break-in.\n\n\"But we were all so poor, there wasn't much to be lost,\" Hong said.\n\nBut in 1986 that changed. In September that year, a woman was murdered, the first in a series of killings that came to be known as the Hwaseong murders. By 1991, 10 women and girls had been killed in the Hwaseong region, including the 13-year-old killed in her bed. In all of the cases, the victims had been sexually assaulted, and in many of the cases, an article of their clothing, such as stockings or a blouse, had been used in the killing. The victims included housewives, schoolgirls, and a department store worker, according to Ha Seung-gyun, who was involved in the investigation.\n\nThe youngest were teenagers, the oldest were 71 years old, according to police records.\n\nNo one seemed safe.\n\nAs the murders kept happening, the people of Hwaseong grew more afraid.\n\nResidents formed squads and patrolled the streets at night, armed with sticks. Women avoided going out after dark.\n\n\"There were no street lights and it was very dark,\" said 55-year-old Park, who worked at a factory in Jinan-ri, another village in Hwaseong, in the 1980s. CNN agreed not to use her full name due to the sensitivity of the case. \"I would take the bus and when I encountered a man, I'd be frightened. I was told not to wear red clothes and not to go out after dark.\" There were rumors the killer attacked women wearing that color, Ha said. \"There was a big rumor about the red clothes (attracting the killer). The third killing involved a woman, Lee, who worked at a department store in Suwon.\"\n\nHong, the Taean-eup resident, remembers that men were afraid of being questioned by police. The village became quiet and eerie, he said. \"We were worried for being mistaken as criminals, so we didn't go out drinking either. Even if we hadn't done anything, things could get out of our hands.\"\n\nThe investigation\n\nWhen the first victim was murdered, the responsibility fell to local police to investigate. But after three females were found dead within three months, they brought in investigators from a nearby city to help. \"From the third killing, the police saw that it was a serious case. It had wide media coverage and local residents were frightened,\" said detective Ha, who was one of the leaders of the investigation, in a lengthy interview last year on the South Korean YouTube channel he created to highlight cases he worked on.\n\nBy then, police were sure that they were looking for a serial killer, but Ha said they had few clues.\n\nVideo taken during the original investigation of the Hwaseong serial killings.

(Credit: JTBC)\n\nIt was a time before surveillance cameras or phone tracking, and before DNA evidence was widely available. Police had to rely on other, more creative measures to catch the killer.\n\nThe first five murders happened within a 6 km (3.7 mile) radius in Hwaseong so police spread out in teams of two, dotted every 100 meters (328 feet), Ha said. It didn't work: the next killing happened where there was no police presence.\n\nSome female police officers wore red and tried to lure the killer into a trap, others went to a clairvoyant who told them to find a man with a missing finger, and some became so frustrated that they performed a shamanistic ritual on a voodoo scarecrow, Ha said.\n\nBut the killings kept happening. Police logged more than 2 million days on the case -- a record for an investigation in South Korea, according to news agency Yonhap. \"The more we looked (at the victim's bodies), (the more) we couldn't hide our feeling of powerlessness, our anger at the killer,\" said Ha, who is now retired and in his 70s, in his YouTube video.\n\n\"After months spent on the rice paddies and fields tracking the killer, I can say that our hatred of him was beyond imagination.\"\n\nYoon was the only person ever convicted of any of the 10 murders. Police suspected he carried out a copycat killing -- all the other victims had been murdered outside, said Ha, who wasn't involved in Yoon's investigation.\n\nThe other nine murders went unsolved.\n\nA breakthrough\n\nFor many years, it seemed that one of South Korea's most infamous serial killers would never be found. The mystery was revisited in \"Memories of Murder,\" a 2003 film by \"Parasite\" director Bong Joon Ho. Then a few years later, as the statute of limitations expired for the last victim, it became clear that, even if the killer was found, there would be no trial or justice for the victims' families.\n\nBut the murders didn't leave Hwaseong's collective memory, even as the villages eventually incorporated into a small city. And the police didn't give up their search.\n\nVideo taken during the original investigation into the Hwaseong serial killings. Date unknown (Credit: KBS)\n\nIn September 2019, Gyeonggi Nambu Provincial Police superintendent general Ban Gi-soo, the latest police officer in charge of the investigation, made an explosive announcement. In July, police sent evidence that had been held in their files for 30 years to the National Forensic Service for DNA testing.\n\nThe DNA evidence from at least three of the murders matched one man: Lee Chun-jae. Lee is currently in prison serving a life sentence for the 1994 rape and murder of his sister-in-law, according to Daejeon court officials and South Korea's Justice Ministry. It was huge news in South Korea.\n\nA month later, there was another development. Lee confessed to all 10 of the Hwaseong murders, and four others that police did not provide details on.\n\nHe had given a detailed confession, even drawing on a piece of paper to explain the locations of the killings, an official from Gyeonggi Nambu Provincial Police Agency said.\n\nLee Chun-jae's high school graduation photo, left, and a facial composite of the Hwaseong serial killer. (Credit: Korea Times)\n\n\"It is an important case that had prompted questions all over Korea,\" the official said. \"The victims and their families had strongly demanded (the truth).\"\n\nIt was a major breakthrough in one of the country's most infamous serial killing cases. But it also left authorities in a tricky position.\n\nIf Lee murdered all 10 people -- including the 13-year-old -- then Yoon had spent 20 years in prison for a murder he didn't commit.\n\nLee's confession alone wasn't enough to clear Yoon's name. In the eyes of the law, he was still a convicted murderer.\n\nThree days of no sleep\n\nThese days, Yoon is a gregarious man in his 50s. He works at a leather processing factory in North Chungcheong Province, a few hours' train ride from Seoul, and he still walks with a limp. On the surface, he is cheerful and sociable, a man who speaks loudly and laughs freely.\n\nBut his life has been one of hardship.\n\nAs a child, Yoon's family moved around, Yoon says. When Yoon was in his third year at school, his mother passed away in a car accident. After that, his father disappeared, and Yoon quit school to start work. Yoon came to Hwaseong, where he begged outside a fried chicken restaurant for a year, he said. When he was about 11, he began working at a farming tool center, and by 22 was training at the same center to become a qualified technician.\n\nHe was a heavy smoker, and had never been in a relationship with a woman, he told police in his confession. \"I haven't even tried talking to girls because I thought no one would like a disabled person like me,\" he said.\n\nHis former boss, Hong, remembers him as always being a bit sad. \"I think it was because he grew up without his parents,\" Hong said. \"He wasn't very articulate and didn't express his feelings much. He was excellent at repairing machines though.\"\n\nAfter the police took him away, Yoon remembers being kept handcuffed in the interrogation room for three days. He barely ate, and was only allowed to leave to go to the toilet. Whenever he tried to sleep, police would wake him up.\n\n\"Those times were much like a nightmare,\" he said. \"When you don't get sleep for three days, you don't know what you said. You don't remember what you did. You can't think properly.\n\n\"You just go along with their questions, on and on.\"\n\nNowadays, Yoon thinks that he was mistreated, but at the time, Yoon didn't know anything about law -- he hadn't even finished elementary school.\n\nYoon served 20 years in prison for the murder and rape of a girl in 1988. Yoon is now seeking to overturn his conviction at retrial. (Credit: Charles Miller) Yoon walks in his neighborhood in North Chungcheong Province.

(Credit: Yoonjung Seo)\n\nYoon ultimately signed three confessions and at trial he admitted to the murder, hoping to avoid the death penalty. He served 20 years.\n\n\"He must have felt everything was so unfair, spending years in prison,\" said Hong, who went out of business when Yoon went to jail as he couldn't continue his company without Yoon's skill set. \"I lost my business, but he lost his life.\"\n\nLast December, Gyeonggi Namu Provincial Police launched a formal probe into the conduct of seven police officers and one prosecutor who worked on the original investigation into the killings, including reviewing allegations of abuse of power during arrests. The results of the investigation haven't been released yet.\n\nYoon's experience wasn't totally unusual for the time. In the 1980s, it was common for suspected criminals in South Korea to be kept awake for long periods to extract a confession, according to Lee Soo-jung, a forensic psychology professor at Kyonggi University.\n\n\"It was a time when confessions, without evidence, were enough to get someone convicted.\"Lee Soo-jung\n\nAnd it wasn't just Yoon who accused police of torture. Kim Chil-joon, an attorney who defended other suspects in the Hwaseong murder case, said many people were abused during the investigation.\n\nOne of his clients, also surnamed Kim, was accused of the fourth and fifth killings after a medium in the United States said they had seen him in their dream, he said. Kim was subject to torture and interrogation and in 1995 successfully sued the government for damages.\n\nBut Kim took his own life two years later after bouts of depression and PTSD, Kim Chil-joon said.\n\nLast year, chief inspector Ban said police were investigating whether officers abused suspects during the original investigation, revisiting allegations that one man was waterboarded with spicy seafood soup.\n\nBut these officers will likely never be charged -- the statute of limitations has run out on those allegations, too.\n\n\"I want my honor back\"\n\nYoon is determined to clear his name, and his retrial began this week. That in itself is a rare event in South Korea.\n\nA tiny fraction of applications for retrials are accepted and they generally require new evidence, according to lawyer Heo Yoon, who specializes in providing retrial legal advice.\n\nPark Joon-young, one of Yoon's attorneys, says that evidence is rarely kept for longer than 20 years except in the most high-profile cases -- like Hwaseong.\n\nHow a serial killing case stretched on for decades\n\n1986 A woman is found dead in Hwaseong. This is the first of the Hwaseong serial killings.\n\n1989 Yoon is questioned by police and charged with one of the Hwaseong murders.\n\n1990 Yoon is sentenced to life in prison for the murder.\n\n1991 A 10th woman is killed in Hwaseong, marking the final of the serial killings.\n\n2003 A movie directed by Bong Joon-ho based on the murders is released. The movie is called \"Memories of Murder\".\n\n2006 The statute of limitations runs out on the most recent Hwaseong killing.\n\n2009 Yoon is released from prison.\n\n2019 Police test DNA taken from Hwaseong murder scenes. They identify a culprit, who confesses to the murders.\n\n2020 Yoon goes on retrial for the murder that he spent 20 years in prison for.\n\n\n\nSource: Korean National Police\n\n\n\nIn Yoon's case, Lee Chun-jae's confession will be crucial. It's possible that the convicted murderer will testify in court before the three judges, who have the power to overturn Yoon's conviction, Park said.\n\nThere's a good chance he'll be acquitted. At a pre-retrial hearing in February, the presiding judge verbally apologized for Yoon's false conviction.\n\nYet, there are still issues with Yoon's case. Although Lee's DNA matches a number of the murders, police have not announced any DNA evidence connecting him with the 13-year-old girl.\n\nAlso, pubic hairs found at the scene returned a 40% match with Yoon's, according to a 1989 report written by an expert at National Forensic Service (NFS).\n\nThose hairs have not been DNA tested -- and even if they do ultimately match Yoon's, his lawyer Park warns it's possible that a sample taken from Yoon could have been mixed up with evidence taken from the scene of the murder. The court has ordered the NFS to extract DNA from the hair, Park said.\n\nThe retrial is expected to take place over a number of months, but if Yoon is found not guilty, he can make a claim for compensation, according to Park.\n\nYoon says nothing can compensate him for the 20 years of life he lost. Even when he was freed from prison 10 years ago, the world had changed so much that initially he wanted to go back in. \"It took me around three years to adjust,\" he said. \"I couldn't live. My life patterns at the prison didn't accommodate the new world I was faced with.\"\n\n\"I want to clear my false accusation, and I want my honor back. I want to be satisfied with these, and that's all.\"Yoon\n\nYoon knows Lee will never be tried for the crime, nor will the police officers who he says tortured him, because too many years have passed since the sleepless nights he spent in that small police interrogation room.\n\nHe just wants to live the rest of his life as an innocent man.\n\n\"I want to clear my false accusation, and I want my honor back,\" he says. \"I want to be satisfied with these, and that's all.\"", "link": "https://us.cnn.com/2020/05/23/asia/south-korea-hwaseong-murder-injustices-intl-hnk/index.html", "published": "2020-05-23T00:00:00", "author": ["Julia Hollingsworth", "Yoonjung Seo", "Jake Kwon"]}, {"title": "Dozens killed as Pakistani airliner crashes in Karachi", "text": "Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) At least 97 people have been killed after a Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) flight crashed Friday in the southern Pakistani city of Karachi , according to a statement from the Sindh Health Department.\n\nThe airline's CEO said at a news conference that the flight from Lahore was carrying 99 passengers and crew members in total.

It is unclear why air traffic control was discussing such a landing.\n\nA few seconds later the pilot can be heard giving several mayday calls, followed by a response from air traffic control saying both runways are clear to land.

Is someone on a wind-up?,\" Hadley told CNN, speaking about his reaction after getting a message from his manager with Shalehan's request.\n\n\"I looked into it and realized that this chap had, I thought, won fairly and squarely,\" he added. \"I didn't understand what the problem was, I thought he certainly pronounced my name correctly. It's not the most difficult name to pronounce.\"\n\nSo Hadley filmed a video telling Shalehan he deserved his winnings. It finally forced an apology from the station, which awarded Shalehan the prize in full -- wrapping up a wonderfully unique episode.\n\n'He was robbed'\n\nThe station was initially steadfast in their decision that Shalehan had said \"Hadley\" with too strong an inflection to earn the prize.\n\nThe \"Celebrity Name Drop\" game continued for more than two weeks after Shalehan's entry, with he and the public under the assumption that he had got one answer wrong. But eventually, another caller put forward the same set of answers -- and was crowned a winner.\n\nImmediately the station was inundated with messages on social media from confused fans, asking the same question: What about Shalehan?\n\n\"What happened? A very very truly sad climax to a contest which should have finished on a high note,\" one user wrote. \"He was robbed of the title,\" another exclaimed.\n\nThe station came forward with an explanation : \"The rules of the game requires callers to pronounce the celebrities name accurately. Mispronounced names therefore cannot be & were not regarded as correct entries,\" the statement said. \"In the case of Shalehan, he mispronounced Tony Hadley. We hope this clarifies!\"\n\nThe station even posted an audio comparison on Facebook to clear up the confusion, playing Shalehan's answer and that of the winner.\n\nBut Shalehan spent days lobbying Gold 905 to change the decision, adamant that he had said the singer's name correctly.\n\n\"Have some integrity!\" he implored on the station's page, picking up scores of supporters who bombarded the station's social media channels for days with pleas for them to reverse course.\n\nIn an attempt to smooth over the controversy, which had run for two weeks, the station said they were \"heartened by the passion shown by Mr Shalehan\" and had privately offered him a \"goodwill\" gesture.\n\n\"Although we had communicated to Mr Shalehan that our decision was final according to the rules of the contest, we are touched by his commitment and resourcefulness -- including reaching out to Tony Hadley,\" the station added in a statement.\n\nBut the controversy didn't end there. \"When (they) offered me the 'consolation prize,' I felt a bit insulted,\" Shalehan told CNN. He felt he was entitled to the full prize. He knew this much was true, as Hadley would sing -- and he finally decided to take his battle to the man who's got the power to know.\n\n\"He obviously felt pretty aggrieved, and rightly so,\" Hadley told CNN. \"He's a very nice chap, and him and his wife are expecting baby number four any minute,\" added the singer, who spoke with Shalehan shortly before the station awarded him the prize.\n\n\"I listened to his pronunciation of my name I though, well there's nothing wrong with that at all.\"\n\nWith that, Shalehan's persistence was finally rewarded.\n\n\"We have reached out to Mr Shalehan again to convey that we are deeply sorry. Since Tony Hadley has said that Mr Shalehan said his name correctly, who are we to disagree?\" the station said on Friday. \"The full prize of $10,000 cash and shopping spree will also be awarded to Mr Shalehan.\"\n\n\"I am just so happy,\" Shalehan told CNN. \"The best news of my life,\" he added in a Facebook post.\n\nShalehan thanked those who supported him. \"For all we/listeners know I am the righful winner,\" he added in the post. \"(And) a big thank you to Mr Tony Hadley for his effort.\"\n\nNow the story has gone viral -- and nobody is more surprised than Hadley himself. \"I didn't know it was going to go global,\" the singer said. \"I suppose everyone at these times is looking for a nice outcome.\"", "link": "https://us.cnn.com/2020/05/22/asia/tony-hadley-singapore-radio-controversy-scli-intl/index.html", "published": "2020-05-22T00:00:00", "author": ["Rob Picheta", "Chermaine Lee"]}, {"title": "Intermittent fasting and a new passion helped him lose 95 pounds", "text": "(CNN) In May 2018, Jared Sklar's wake-up call was waiting for him when he got home from work. He opened the fridge and saw four different pizza boxes from four different restaurants.\n\n\"It's pretty embarrassing, but it's the truth,\" Sklar said. \"I just opened the door, and I was just like, 'What are we doing here?' \"\n\nAt 285 pounds (129 kilograms), he would sit on the couch and watch TV, with no energy left after conquering the work day. Late-night snacks included popcorn and ice cream. The 27-year-old, who works in sales for Corporate Strategies in Woodland Hills, California, knew something had to change.\n\nAnd gradually, his clothes felt like they were getting smaller every time he did laundry.\n\n\"It gets to that point where you realize that you're getting bigger; the clothes aren't getting smaller,\" he said. \"It was that a-ha moment.\"\n\nThere were other epiphanies as well. Sklar missed the feeling he got when he used to play sports as a teenager. And there was a history of heart disease in his family.\n\nTogether, he and his girlfriend, Samatha MacDonald, decided to make a lifestyle change. They had talked about doing it before, but this time, it stuck. They didn't want to look back 20 years from now and realize they could have made changes to be healthier then.\n\nJared and his girlfriend, Samantha, during their lifestyle change.\n\nFirst, they would start going to the gym. But they didn't want to put in the hours of fitness without having the right diet to fuel it and bring up their energy levels.\n\nOther diets sounded too quick for what Sklar wanted to do. He researched intermittent fasting and decided to try it as a sustainable long-term option.\n\nSklar and MacDonald would eat their meals between 12 p.m. and 8 p.m. each day, creating a 16-hour break before eating again. This helped them kick the late-night snacking habit.\n\n\"I like time restricted feeding because it allows you to naturally reduce your food intake without counting calories,\" said Lisa Drayer, CNN contributor and registered dietician. \"You eliminate mindless nibbling in the evening and you're also eating in sync with your circadian rhythm so you're front loading your calories, which is more favorable for weight loss.\"\n\nThey immediately noticed their energy levels start to pick back up as they swapped out pizza for proteins like turkey alongside vegetables, spaghetti squash instead of spaghetti and Greek yogurt bars instead of ice cream.\n\n\"When you're eating only during an eight-hour period, you do want to follow good nutritional guidelines, including protein, fiber, enough fluids in your diet as well,\" Drayer said.\n\nSklar loved eating healthier options, but sometimes had a hard time getting up to go to the gym. For MacDonald, food was a weakness, but she was excited to get up and work out.\n\n\"We pushed each in our weak areas,\" MacDonald said. \"We were on different pages initially but pushed each other to be on the same page, and that was a huge help.\"\n\nSklar was also dealing with a chronic hamstring issue, discovered by his doctor after playing flag football and repeatedly pulling his hamstring before the diet. His doctor recommended low-impact exercise, which led Sklar to try indoor cycling. He went to the gym six days a week and pedaled for 45 minutes each day.\n\nThe couple tried working out together, but found they slowed each other down. While Sklar was pedaling at the gym, MacDonald found that working out at a high-intensity interval training studio worked better for her.\n\nSklar and MacDonald also cut back on carbohydrates and replaced a lot of the red meat in his diet with leaner proteins like fish, chicken or ground turkey. They became more conscious of what they were eating overall, making healthier decisions during their eight-hour window each day.\n\n\"If you're only eating in these eight hours, it's powerful to choose what you put into your body,\" MacDonald said.\n\nThe first month, he had lost 15 pounds (6.8 kilograms) while cycling and starting intermittent fasting. It continued for the next six months. Sklar fell in love with cycling. The combination of the music and the calories burned during each session fueled him to continue.\n\nSklar also found motivation when a close family member had to undergo triple bypass surgery in October.\n\n\"When you see that person in the hospital going through that, you just think to yourself that you never want that to happen to you, and you want to prevent it from happening to anybody else that you know,\" Sklar said. \"That was my why. That was a light bulb moment where I knew I had to not only keep this going, lose the weight for me, but I also needed to keep it going for my future self and everybody else around me.\"\n\nOver a six to seven-month period, Sklar lost 95 pounds (43 kg). Eventually, one of the instructors pulled Sklar aside and told him he should start teaching an indoor cycling class. He's been teaching for about six months now.\n\nFor MacDonald, the changes have been more mental than physical. She lost 12 pounds (5.4 kilograms) and loves feeling stronger.\n\n\"On a busy day, the hour I'm going to the gym is something I'm giving myself,\" she said.\n\nWhen you realize you're gaining more muscle and feeling better every day, you can feel yourself getting stronger. That was a big thing. I had never stayed with a workout long enough to feel those changes after months. It makes me feel better every day to slowly see these changes in my body.\"\n\nIn the morning, Sklar usually has a glass of water after getting up. Lunch is at noon, followed by snacks throughout the day. Before a workout, Sklar enjoys peanut butter and jelly on a rice cake.\n\n\"I teach a spin class at 5:30 at night, then I'll have a protein shake and dinner right after, and then I'll maybe have a small snack at 8:00 p.m. I fast for the rest of the night until noon the next day.\"\n\nAfter the initial weight loss, Sklar and MacDonald are allowing for a little more flexibility if they have a special event. But they are committed to being as healthy and fit as possible for the long-term. Intermittent fasting helped them form healthy habits.\n\nSklar is also training for a triathlon now.\n\nSklar is much more energetic and confident after his weight loss.\n\n\"There's always something in front of me to keep me motivated, to make sure that I don't fall back into my old habits,\" Sklar said.\n\nSklar is continuing to fast and maintain an active lifestyle. He's more confident , energetic and positive. Sometimes, old friends and coworkers don't recognize him. As his story spreads, Sklar has been able to reconnect with friends or acquaintances and share advice on weight loss and fitness.

The no-bid deal, ordered up by the White House coronavirus task force, is worth up to $600 million.\n\nBut nurses, doctors and scientists who have spoken to NBC News about Battelle's hydrogen peroxide vapor chambers said the process it uses remains unproven over long-term use and using masks cleaned by it more than a couple of times could leave front-line health care workers vulnerable to contracting the coronavirus.\n\nTime may tell whether Trump's intervention benefited health care workers and taxpayers as much as it helped him and the company. But it is already clear how Trump has killed oversight, and how he is taking advantage of its death to help himself politically in a re-election year.\n\nHe brazenly steamrolled FDA experts. His special task force in charge of medical supplies, which operates outside the authority of any existing agency, deployed emergency powers to award the Battelle contract without competition or any significant consideration of similar technologies. He has ordered task force members not to testify before Congress for the time being. And, last month, as part of a purge of the inspectors general who would be empowered to investigate aspects of the coronavirus response, he got rid of the Pentagon's top watchdog, who would oversee the deal.\n\nThere is effectively no independent oversight of the Battelle deal or others like it.\n\nA president proud of his work and his intentions should welcome the validation of those checks. But Trump has neutralized them at a time when more money is being pumped out of Washington at a faster pace than ever before. Indeed, he just appointed his own legal counsel and senior adviser to oversee stimulus-law spending.\n\nLet our news meet your inbox. The news and stories that matters, delivered weekday mornings. This site is protected by recaptcha\n\nHis detractors are horrified by the situation, but his loyalists see his roughshod run over competing power centers as the proper exercise of power by a just president.\n\nEric Havian, a whistleblower law expert at the law firm of Constantine Cannon, argues that while \"temporary trimming of oversight is surely understandable\" during a crisis, whistleblowers offer a \"supplement to the government's oversight.\"\n\nUnder another president, that might work. But Trump canned the intelligence community inspector general who bucked him by backing a whistleblower during the Ukraine scandal. He has trashed whistleblowers who have come forward publicly. Those actions and others have made clear there will be brutal consequences for anyone in the administration who questions him.\n\nThe lack of oversight means voters will have less information by which to judge the president when they go to the polls. Trump surely understands that.\n\nWhen he stepped in to help the company, he was desperate to show he was taking action after a slow-footed response to the disease's arrival in the United States. He was on the wrong end of a daily brawl with governors of both parties who pleaded for the federal government to provide supplies to their states amid harrowing shortages. Politically, he needed to first quiet a bipartisan chorus of criticism and then change its tune.\n\nOn March 29, the day after the FDA gave the company partial clearance to use its mask-recycling system, Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine, a Republican whose state houses the company's headquarters, got on the phone to complain to Trump. The language of the waiver prevented Battelle from deploying the machines outside its headquarters and limited the number of masks it could service in a day.\n\nAfter talking to DeWine, Trump pressured FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn to change the waiver, and it was done within hours. The three men applauded one another publicly. An FDA spokesperson told NBC News this week that the decision was based on \"new information\" but did not respond when asked if that information was scientific or political.\n\nThe political value of delivering for DeWine and Ohio was more clear \u2014 it's been 80 years since a winning presidential candidate didn't take the state. The same was true for Trump's direction of ventilators to the battleground states of Colorado and Arizona and his careful attention to the equipment needs of potentially decisive Florida.\n\nThe FDA waiver was just the start of the story. Within five days, the White House coronavirus task force had agreed to buy 60 machines for $1 million apiece. Five days after that, the task force decided to pay Battelle $413 million to include the cost of operating them, which was required by the FDA waiver.\n\nThe task force went ahead with the purchase despite an objection from a Health and Human Services Department expert on federal supply-chain finances, and by May 1 the ceiling on the deal had risen to $600 million, according to the Defense Logistics Agency.\n\nFrom the perspective of Trump's politics, it doesn't matter whether the machines are as effective as Battelle says they are \u2014 or if the cost to taxpayers is justified.\n\nHe showed quick action after a delayed response to the virus, granted a lucrative deal to a powerful company in the midst of an economic crisis and turned criticism from a prominent Republican governor in a crucial swing state into praise. He also eased his own burden of trying to acquire new masks.\n\nOver the long term, if nurses working with coronavirus patients get sick, it will be difficult, if not impossible, to prove it was the result of masks degraded as part of the recycling program. The FDA spokesperson told NBC News that the company has reported damage to 94 masks so far, representing less than two-hundredths of a percent of the number decontaminated.\n\nIt will also take time to find out whether taxpayers got a good deal for Battelle's work.\n\nBut because Trump has effectively gutted oversight of his administration, only voters can hold him accountable if his decisions were bad \u2014 or made for the wrong reasons.", "link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/trump-gutted-checks-his-power-when-they-were-most-needed-n1213901", "published": "2020-05-24T13:54:00+00:00", "author": ["Jonathan Allen", "Jonathan Allen Is A Senior Political Analyst For Nbc News", "Based In Washington."]}, {"title": "Brazil's cases surge in densely packed neighborhoods", "text": "SEE NEW POSTS\n\nJapan looking to end Tokyo's state of emergency TOKYO - Japan is looking to lift a state of emergency for Tokyo and remaining areas still facing restrictions while also considering fresh stimulus worth almost $1 trillion to help companies ride out the coronavirus pandemic, Nikkei reported on Monday.

While the virus took root slowly in the poorest country in the Americas, in the last two weeks the number of confirmed cases has nearly quintupled to 865 while reports of a mysterious \"fever\" are spreading. Ever since the first cases of the new coronavirus were confirmed in Haiti in mid-March, Voodoo priests have been serving up teas with ingredients including moringa, eucalyptus, ginger and honey to strengthen the immune system. More than half of Haiti\u2019s 11 million people are believed to practice voodoo, a religion brought from West Africa centuries ago by enslaved men and women and practiced clandestinely under French colonial rule.

The town is geographically in the Netherlands, but there are 22 Belgian enclaves completely surrounded by Dutch territory.\n\nWithin those enclaves are eight Dutch enclaves, together known as Baarle-Nassau, seven of which are sub-enclaves in the two largest Belgian enclaves\n\nA relic of feudal land swaps in medieval times, this complex situation is not usually a problem: both countries\u2019 membership of the European Union means there is a frictionless border and no barriers to trade.\n\n\u201cIn this town, of course you have the Dutch part and the Belgium part,\u201d said Sarah Bakker, a 19-year-old university student who is quarantining with her family in Baarle-Hertog-Nassau. \u201cIt's weird, but I'm used to it.\u201d\n\nLet our news meet your inbox.

Dean Mouhtaropoulos / Getty Images\n\nBut Belgium and the Netherlands enforced drastically different lockdown rules, meaning that shops on the Dutch side of the border could stay open, while just yards away in Belgium, some shops had to close.\n\nThe town\u2019s thousands of physical markers \u2014 from painted white crosses on the pavement, to the colors of the flag of either country on street signs and house numbers \u2014 suddenly became vitally important.\n\n\u201cBecause we have the situation that Belgium has chosen the complete lockdown, in the Netherlands they have chosen the \u2018intelligent\u2019 lockdown which gives differences in thinking and acting. Well, there we have a problem,\u201d said Willem van Gool, chairman of Tourism Baarle-Hertog-Nassau.\n\nVan Gool explained there were already two schools, two city halls and two police forces for the people of each country. \u201cBut there's just one tourism office and we have a single fire brigade because that's more clever.\u201d\n\nSome of the town\u2019s shops actually straddle the border. Before Belgium lifted restrictions on shops opening May 11, only half of a branch of a Dutch chain store, Zeeman, was accessible to customers, ensuring a unique shopping experience.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really weird,\u201d Bakker said with a laugh. \u201cOnly one half of the store is open, so you\u2019re only able to get half of the products.\u201d The same goes for seeing friends. \u201cThe Dutch part, the friends who live there, I can see. But, the Belgian part I can\u2019t because I will get a fine.\u201d\n\nThe access and permissions sticker for cross-border commuting which is allowed for vital sectors and crucial professions on a street in Baarle Nassau.

So if passengers take a bus on the Dutch side of Baarle-Hertog-Nassau, they can get on mask-free, but just a little distance down the road, they have to put one on.\n\nLocal residents have long been used to the quirks of living in a town that borders two countries, but some admit the differing lockdown rules have caused real problems.\n\nArtist Sylvia Reybroek, whose gallery sits right on the border, had a firsthand taste of how strange life has become. in their little town. The white painted crosses dividing the two countries run across the street and through her shop's front door and into the gallery. Because her business is registered in Belgium, she decided to follow its stricter rules.\n\n\u201cAfter a few weeks, you see a big difference,\u201d Reybroek lamented. \u201cI closed my shop, I have a Belgian company, so I was closed. Meanwhile, the rest of the shops [on the street] were open.\u201d\n\nLike many countries in Europe, both Belgium and the Netherlands have started lifting their restrictions and Reybroek has since reopened.\n\nBut, she said, her shop is a microcosm of Europe's problems and she suggests a simpler way to handle the crisis.\n\n\u201cI think Europe should have had one rule,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are Europe.\u201d", "link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/dutch-belgian-how-lockdown-works-town-one-world-s-most-n1213921", "published": "2020-05-24T08:33:00+00:00", "author": ["Tesa Arcilla"]}, {"title": "COVID-19 is costing drug cartels millions of dollars", "text": "Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic has crippled cities and crushed businesses from coast to coast.\n\nIt\u2019s also costing drug traffickers millions, multiple law enforcement officials told NBC News, because their methods of moving money have been compromised.\n\nSince the start of the crisis, federal drug agents in major U.S. hubs have seized substantially more illicit cash than usual amid statewide lockdowns that have disrupted the way cartels do business, the officials said.\n\n\u201cTheir activities are a lot more apparent than they were three months ago,\u201d said Bill Bodner, special agent in charge of the Drug Enforcement Administration\u2019s Los Angeles field office.\n\nBodner said California\u2019s stay-at-home order has made it more difficult for traffickers to launder money and move around the city unseen.\n\n\u201cWhen there\u2019s less hay in the haystack, it\u2019s easier to find the needle,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s caused the drug cartels and money launderers to take more risks, and that\u2019s where we can capitalize.\u201d\n\nPart of a $1 million seizure in the Los Angeles area. DEA\n\nFrom March 1 to May 8, seizures of cash in the greater Los Angeles area have more than doubled from $4.5 million last year to $10 million during the same period this year. Bodner said that includes four separate seizures of more than $1 million in Long Beach, Cerritos, Anaheim and Wildomar.\n\nDEA agents operating on the East Coast have seen similar success.\n\nThe New York City field division\u2019s cash seizures are up 180 percent since last year, said special agent in charge Ray Donovan, with the bulk of them coming in the last couple of months.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really around April, where we started saying, \u2018Hey, we\u2019re having a lot more success in this area,'\u201d Donovan said.\n\nWhen moving product along the West Coast, Mexican cartels use manufacturing businesses as de facto banks that help to launder the drug proceeds and funnel the money back across the southern border\n\nLet our news meet your inbox.

This site is protected by recaptcha\n\nBut in New York, the cartels typically rely on \u201cinternational Asian criminal organizations\u201d to clean their cash, Donovan said. These cartel associates will buy American goods with drug money and ship them back to China. In return, the criminal gangs that receive the products will then send money back to the cartels in Mexico \u2014 often through bank wires, which are more difficult to track from China.\n\nBut the city\u2019s lockdown has deprived the traffickers of using the first link in their sophisticated operation.\n\n\u201cWith all the stores and shops closed down here, they don\u2019t have that as one of the means to quickly launder money,\u201d Donovan said.\n\nAs a result, the cartel\u2019s cash has been piling up, Donovan said, resulting in larger seizures.\n\nPre-pandemic busts would often net cash hauls in the neighborhood of $100,000. Now, with the cartel\u2019s laundering methods disrupted, New York DEA agents have been recovering piles of cash exceeding $1 million, Donovan said.\n\n\u201cMore money is being stockpiled here,\u201d he added. \u201cSo when we come across them, instead of seizing $100,000, we seize $1 million or several million dollars.\u201d\n\nThe recent busts haven't been confined to stacks of cash. Along the northern border, federal officers have confiscated large quantities of drugs over the past few months.\n\nFrom March 21 to May 16, border patrol officers working out of the Detroit field office have seized 2,856 pounds of marijuana, 87 pounds of cocaine, 12 pounds of fentanyl and 12 guns.\n\n\u201cWe are definitely seeing an uptick,\u201d said Kris Grogan, spokesman for U.S. Customs and Border Protection in Detroit.\n\nDrugs seized at Blue Water Bridge in Port Huron, Mich., on April 17, 2020. U.S. Customs and Border Protection\n\nDEA agents in Michigan and Ohio have hauled in $6 million in drug money since March 16, officials said. That amount is not unusually high, but there\u2019s been a marked increase in the amount of cash seized at airports.\n\n\u201cHundreds of thousands of dollars,\u201d said Keith Martin, special agent in charge of the DEA\u2019s Detroit field office. \u201cWhich is not normal.\u201d\n\nUnlike New York and Los Angeles, the drug money made in Michigan and Ohio is moved the old-fashioned way \u2014 by driving it across the southern border.\n\nMartin said it\u2019s too early to draw a firm conclusion on what\u2019s fueling the spike in cash seizures at airports, but a drop in car traffic because of statewide lockdowns is likely a contributing factor.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t want to be that one vehicle out in the road that gets pulled over,\u201d Martin said. \u201cWhen there\u2019s not a lot of border traffic, you\u2019re singled out easier than if there were a thousand cars.\u201d\n\nPart of a $1 million seizure in the Los Angeles area. DEA\n\nWhile COVID-19 is already reshaping parts of the global economy, the impact on the drug cartels\u2019 overall business remains yet to be determined, the officials said.\n\nThe coronavirus is also affecting drug prices. The price of methamphetamine has skyrocketed in California, according to Bodner, rising from about $1,000 a pound in November to upward of $2,000 a pound. He said that\u2019s due in part to the economic disruptions and difficulties in importing chemicals from China and India, as well as the closure of the southern border to nonessential travel.\n\nIn New York, the price of marijuana is up 55 percent, according to Donovan, in part because of the increased risk of getting it into the country. Cocaine is up 12 percent, and heroin 7 percent, he said.\n\nThe virus has also changed the way law enforcement operates. One example: fewer DEA agents in the office, and more out in the streets.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re practicing social distancing,\u201d said Martin, the Detroit agent. \u201cBut the pandemic has not kept us from doing our job.\u201d\n\nFederal agents are also out in the streets en masse in Los Angeles and New York.\n\n\u201cI asked all my agents to stay in the street and just work in the street,\u201d Donovan said. \u201cWe are there for our community, and ultimately, we\u2019re doing a pretty damn good job.\u201d", "link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/crime-courts/covid-19-costing-drug-cartels-millions-dollars-n1213181", "published": "2020-05-24T11:13:00+00:00", "author": ["Andrew Blankstein", "Andrew Blankstein Is An Investigative Reporter For Nbc News.

With no running water, her father hauls it in almost daily. They live about 8 miles from the closest and only grocery store in their high desert community, where shoppers have felt the strain of limited supplies through the rationing of foods like meat.\n\nPrior to the coronavirus pandemic \"people were dependent on the grocery store,\" Wilson said. \"Now, they're in shock or worried about how they're going to keep their pantries filled when they can't go to the stores like they used to. It's a wake-up call that we need to go back to growing our own foods and tending to our own livestock.\"\n\nCynthia Wilson, the traditional foods program director of Utah Dine Bikeyah, is mailing indigenous seeds as part of the \"Seeds and Sheep\" program. Cynthia Wilson\n\nWilson, the traditional foods program director of Utah Din\u00e9 Bik\u00e9yah, an Indigenous-led nonprofit that has worked to protect the Bears Ears national monument in southern Utah and the ancestral lands of several Indigenous peoples, found her motivation amid all of the uncertainty. This month, she helped launch a \"Seeds and Sheep\" program in response to the pandemic and mailed out 1,500 seed packets to homes in the Four Corners region that want to plant and grow their own food.\n\nThe initial goal was to reach 100 families. She heard from more than 300.\n\nAcross the country, as households turn to planting and gardening as a relaxing hobby or to become more self-sufficient during turbulent times, the act of cultivating one's own food has taken on a greater significance among Native American communities where the pandemic has laid bare an enduring food crisis and a desire to return to customs and traditions some fear are slowly being lost.\n\nFull coverage of the coronavirus outbreak\n\nThe idea of Native food sovereignty \u2014 that tribes can farm, access and secure healthy and culturally essential foods that empower their citizens, respect the lands and are not bound to outside policies \u2014 was already a growing movement among Indigenous peoples, said Elizabeth Hoover, an author and assistant professor of American studies at Brown University who writes about food and environmental health and justice in Native communities.\n\nBut for more people to move toward food sovereignty, \"a lot of elders would say what it's going to take is a crisis that will keep people from going to the grocery store and picking up food like they used to,\" she said.\n\nSeeding a movement\n\nHoover, who is of Mi'kmaq and Mohawk ancestry, grew up on a farm in upstate New York. Elders, she said, recalled that \"nobody knew the Depression was happening around here because everyone had their own gardens.\"\n\nDespite untrue assumptions that Native American tribes have a multitude of acres at their disposal and primed for harvesting, outdated policies and discriminatory lending practices by the federal government have kept many Native farmers at a financial disadvantage, Hoover said.\n\nIn 2010, the U.S. Department of Agriculture reached a $680 million settlement on a class-action lawsuit that alleged the agency engaged in discriminatory lending against Native American farmers for nearly two decades. Those farmers said they received significantly fewer loans and more onerous terms than were provided to white farmers. In response, the USDA said it is \"committed to resolving all cases involving allegations of past discrimination by individuals.\"\n\nLet our news meet your inbox. The news and stories that matters, delivered weekday mornings. This site is protected by recaptcha\n\nBut the troubling legacy of discrimination intersects with other urgent issues surrounding food sovereignty, including disparities in Indian Country of poor health care and disease, now exacerbated by the coronavirus; environmental battles over oil pipelines and access to clean water; federal policies that have eroded tribal territory and ancestral lands; and climate change that has led to increased drought and flooding throughout the country.\n\nWith so much at stake, Hoover said, the younger Native American generation is seeing the appeal of a type of farming that's more community-oriented rather than mass farming, like growing soybean and corn for commodities markets, or on the opposite end of the spectrum, a quaint pastime.\n\n\"It's not just doing as grandma did: Plant your garden because it's an old-timey thing to do,\" she said. \"It's resistance to corporations, to people working cheek by jowl in meat plants, to an unreliable supply chain where products are shipped from thousands of miles away contributing to the carbon footprint. So for these young folks, they're asking: How do you resist that system and all it stands for?\"\n\nChanging mindsets\n\nAttempts to challenge that system to the benefit of Native populations are being made by Cherokee communities swapping seed kits for each season, Oglala Lakota chefs preserving Native food traditions and Native-run community colleges teaching methods that might otherwise be forgotten.\n\nNueta Hidatsa Sahnish College, a public tribal community college in New Town, North Dakota, will begin its \"food security\" program this week, said Lori Nelson, the school's land grant director. Eighteen applicants have signed up to learn how to grow their own gardens or plant using containers, while the college itself expects to make produce available to people through an acre-size \"pick-your-own\" garden.\n\n\"Much of North Dakota is in a food desert,\" Nelson, who recently applied for a USDA grant, said. \"People are very used to flour and sugar and processed foods. It's really difficult to change mindsets.\"\n\nFort Berthold in New Town, the headquarters for the Three Affiliated Tribes, also known as the MHA Nation, has obesity rates of 86 percent among the adult population and 55 percent among school-age children, triggering higher rates of diabetes and heart disease.\n\nNelson said the hope is to lead citizens down a path with healthier options.\n\n\"If you grow your own food,\" she added, \"you're more likely to eat it.\"\n\nGrowing results\n\nNative seed organizations say the pandemic has increased interest in what they've been doing for decades.\n\nThe requests for seeds from the Traditional Native American Farmers Association has doubled this year, said Clayton Brascoupe, one of the founders who has farmed in the foothills of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains of New Mexico for more than four decades.\n\nClayton Brascoupe is a co-founder of the Traditional Native American Farmers Association, which donates seeds to home farmers. Courtesy Clayton Brascoupe\n\nThe association, which has shipped its locally sourced seeds to as far away as Canada and Florida, formed in 1992 to help bring more people, especially youth, into agriculture, teaching about seed quality and germination. Brascoupe, of Mohawk ancestry, said the seeds his association stores are not only important because they're indigenous, but they're nutritionally superior to hybrids.\n\n\"In years past, someone would write or call us, 'Can you send me two to three packets of seeds?'\" Brascoupe said. \"This year, we got hit by a lot of requests. It's not just a couple packets \u2014 we're sending those large priority mail boxes.\"\n\nAmong those who received donations was the organization Utah Din\u00e9 Bik\u00e9yah, which refers to the \"human relationship to the earth's surface\" in the Din\u00e9 Bizaad, or Navajo, language.\n\nDownload the NBC News app for full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak\n\nAlastair Bits\u00f3\u00ed, an organization spokesperson who is Din\u00e9 and a citizen of the Navajo Nation, said the fact that Native farmers are sharing their resources with the \"Seeds and Sheep\" program is meaningful.\n\n\"It's coming, not from outside sources, but within,\" he said. \"That's the beautiful thing.\"\n\nThe seeds \u2014 which include corn, squash, melons and beans \u2014 will be ready to harvest for growers by late summer and the fall, depending on the type of variety, Bits\u00f3\u00ed said. Indigenous families are being asked to share pictures of the fruits \u2014 and vegetables \u2014 of their labor.\n\nThe \"Seeds and Sheep\" program has mailed out 1,500 variety seed packets to families in the Four Corners region of the United States. Cynthia Wilson\n\nSince access to running water and reliable infrastructure remain a problem on Navajo Nation lands, families in the program are being provided 275-gallon water tanks if needed.\n\nThe program is \"a long-term solution,\" Bits\u00f3\u00ed said, in the face of a future wave of COVID-19. The illness has already ravaged the Navajo Nation, which straddles Arizona, New Mexico and Utah and has seen a startling infection rate of more than 2,300 cases per 100,000 people.\n\nThis fall, Utah Din\u00e9 Bik\u00e9yah plans to distribute Navajo-Churro sheep to families interested in livestock farming, another way to keep cultural connections alive, which Bits\u00f3\u00ed said is needed \"more than ever\" during the pandemic.\n\n\"We want our people to basically stop drinking the milk of the border towns and drink right from the source,\" he said.\n\nCynthia Wilson's family grows rows of corn, beans and melons outside of their home in Monument Valley, Utah, on the Navajo Nation.

The last month, in particular, has brought bankruptcies from well-known brands with deep roots around the country. This weekend, Hertz, the rental car giant, joined the list.\n\nBut the impacts of the coronavirus are only half the story. In some cases, such as restaurants and travel companies, the virus is undoubtedly the primary cause of trouble, but in others it looks more like an accelerant \u2014 gas on a retail fire that has been burning for quite some time.\n\nThe last month has been particularly noteworthy. In the space of just two weeks, some of the best-known brands in America declared they were entering Chapter 11 bankruptcy and closing outlets across the country.\n\nBack on May 4, Gold\u2019s Gym, the national chain of exercise facilities, announced it was headed to Chapter 11, a move affecting roughly 4,000 employees and 700 locations in more than 20 states. The company said it was planning to permanently shutter 30 locations. And J. Crew, the well-known purveyor of preppy attire, also filed for Chapter 11, a move affecting 500 locations and 13,000 employees in 44 states.\n\nOn May 7, Neiman Marcus said it was entering Chapter 11, directly affecting roughly 13,000 employees at 68 stores in 18 states. And on May 14, JC Penney, the long-beleaguered legacy retail giant with 850 stores in 49 states said the same thing, a move affecting some 90,000 employees.\n\nLet our news meet your inbox.

Gyms and clothing stores are exactly the kinds of businesses that the coronavirus lockdown seems designed to damage. Raising one\u2019s heart rate and sweating are at-home activities these days and apparel shopping is done with a few clicks of a mouse.\n\nBut even before May, there were signs of trouble for the brick-and-mortar commerce world this year.\n\nBack in mid-February, Pier One entered Chapter 11, a move that affected roughly 970 locations and 18,000 employees scattered around the United States with some in Canada. Art Van Furniture, said it would be shuttering on March 8, affecting 3,000 employees and 169 locations around the Midwest. And on March 11, Modell\u2019s, which claimed to be the oldest sporting goods store in America said it was entering Chapter 11, closing the doors of about 140 locations with 3,600 employees on the East Coast.\n\nAnd even beyond retail, there were signs of trouble elsewhere in the economy. In January, Bar Louie, the trendy upscale chain of bar/bistros, announced it would begin a bankruptcy restructuring hitting 90 locations and 1,500 employees.\n\nIn other words, even before the COVID-19 pandemic hit the United States, there were signs that 2020 might not be shaping up to be a great year for merchants with real-world physical locations. Part of that may have been economic exhaustion. The post-Great Recession expansion had been unfolding for more than 10 years (since 2009) when 2020 arrived. Some retrenching may have been inevitable.\n\nBut on the retail side there was also the steady march of e-commerce, which has been battering brick-and-mortar stores especially hard for a decade now. Consider the numbers from recent years.\n\nIn 2018, retailers closed nearly 6,000 brick-and-mortar locations permanently, according to Coresight Research. In 2019, the figure was even higher, 9,300 locations were shuttered. And, of course, all of those closures had nothing to do with the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nFor months now, much of the COVID conversation has centered on how the pandemic might change the nation. How deep will the changes be? What will the post-pandemic United States look like, particularly economically?\n\nBut even before the virus, the nation and its economy were going through major changes. Keep in mind all those closures in 2018 and 2019 came as the economy was booming.\n\nThere is no question that the coronavirus is hammering the U.S. economy and that it is taking a toll on some healthy businesses and employers. But the biggest economic impact from COVID-19 may be that it is pushing the economy into the future much faster than before, striking hard at businesses that were already weak from other challenges.\n\nIt all serves as a reminder that even after the pandemic is controlled, the road \u201cback to normal\u201d is not going to be easy, and \u201cnormal\u201d may look very different.", "link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/meet-the-press/hertz-jcpenny-j-crew-join-list-businesses-filing-bankruptcy-n1213961", "published": "2020-05-24T13:06:00+00:00", "author": ["Dante Chinni", "Dante Chinni Is A Contributor To Nbc News Specializing In Data Analysis Around Campaigns", "Politics"]}, {"title": "Father-son farmers find a new way to stay afloat during coronavirus pandemic", "text": "Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

As we fast, we become more and more aware of what our body and soul yearn for. We are better able to focus our spiritual, emotional and physical energy. The physical body weakens throughout the day and increasingly becomes the object of our attention. For 30 days, from sunrise to sunset, we participate in spiritual world-making and world-burning; we burn what we don\u2019t need and build spiritual pathways that bring us closer to Allah. It is a purifying process. Think of it as sensory deprivation, where the metaphysical and physical are having a meeting, fortifying a consciousness of oneself.\n\nDue to the global lockdown, Ramadan in 2020 has meant a fast from physical gatherings \u2014 an integral part of Ramadan \u2014 as well as food and drink. The difficult parts of the holiday are typically eased by our community. And yet, amid this global pandemic, mosques around the world are closed.\n\nDue to the global lockdown, Ramadan in 2020 has meant a fast from physical gatherings \u2014 an integral part of Ramadan \u2014 as well as food and drink.\n\nFasting is an intensely personal act of worship and an exercise of personal integrity and discipline. But it\u2019s also surprisingly policed. A.Helwa writes in her book, \u201cSecrets of Divine Love,\u201d that Allah rigs this month in our favor. It is a time to reflect and be still with ourselves \u2014 and yet there is also a pressure to be productive. With the lockdown, this pressure has only increased. At the end of every Ramadan, I feel guilty knowing that I could\u2019ve prayed more, recited more Quran, volunteered more. When in truth I was bartering acts of worship and overcompensating for my shortcomings. Instead of gorging on food when the sun sets, I was gorging on guilt and shame; I was allowing the pressure of external forces to inform my relationship with Islam. Without limits, this can induce anxiety, especially without the help of our physical and spiritual family.\n\nGet the think newsletter.

And as Ramadan comes to a close, this lesson is more important than ever.\n\nWithout access to the same support systems, food is one of the few resources that remains a comfort. There were days I woke up feeling faint and physically weak; it would've been irresponsible to keep fasting. But I also didn't feel compelled to push myself like I normally do. I've been fasting since I was seven years old, but the exhaustion I felt this month was psychological. I listened to my body and broke my fast when I needed to, and I kept a tally of the days I missed and rested. The best way I could honor my time this Ramadan was by honoring the needs of my body. Fasting is for Allah, and I have no one else to answer to.\n\nRamadan is about world dissolution, but this month our worlds shrunk to the digital perimeters of our screens and our homes. The world only existed in the infinite scrolls of social media, the two feet around me in my bed, or the rush from the car to the grocery store and back. With nothing to do and nowhere to go, all my tension and pain was heightened. Each day dissolved into the next. Instead of trying to unearth selfishness this month, I became acutely aware and obsessed with my own body and how I treated myself. I extended myself the mercy I try to extend to everyone else, and in return found myself becoming less reactive, more patient and empathetic. Ramadan is not supposed to about depriving yourself of food, but it wasn\u2019t until April that I understood what that meant. I didn\u2019t try to focus on repetitive ritualistic acts or try to use my time wisely, I just let myself be.\n\nI didn\u2019t try to focus on repetitive ritualistic acts or try to use my time wisely, I just let myself be.\n\nRamadan this year has also revealed there is more work to be done, especially when it comes to making communities and houses of worship welcoming to all. Growing up, I spent sundown to dusk with friends at the masjid (mosque), and after I moved from Minnesota, I was lucky to find a new community with other transplants in New York City. We created our own families and traditions, and ignored sleep to imagine a liberated, utopian world. After taraweeh, an optional extra prayer after the last prayer of the day, we\u2019d pair mint tea with mint shisha until we couldn\u2019t keep our eyes open. It is a privilege to have this community, and one not every Muslim enjoys \u2014 especially queer, Black and Shia Muslims.\n\n\u201cIn Islam, there is a natural tendency to gravitate towards people who give off certain vibes. Meaning, some spiritual personalities are alike, and while others differ. Allah has created such diversity, that we feel comfortable and uncomfortable in different communities \u2014 this can tamper with our faith,\u201d says Aamina Khan, social editor at Them.\n\nThe Islam my parents taught me, and still preach, reveals a way of lifestyle in which every day acts can be forms of worship. Intention precedes action. As Solange Knowles says, \u201cdo nothing without intention.\u201d\n\nFasts can always be made up. Ramadan is meant for us to foster spiritual closeness to God; it\u2019s a time when we\u2019re supposed to express gratitude and ask God for guidance. My hope is that Muslims have not spent this Ramadan counting down the hours before darkness, but instead have used the time to practice mercy \u2014 for everyone, including themselves. I want to train myself to surrender, to rid myself of bad habits, to stay kind to others but also to myself. I want to learn to be loving and softer. To quote Imam Hamid al-Ghazali, \u201cthe merit of fasting is not in its hunger, as the merit of medicine is not in its bitterness.\u201d", "link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/eid-2020-ramadan-pandemic-helped-me-rethink-my-relationship-fasting-ncna1213426", "published": "2020-05-22T23:16:14+00:00", "author": ["Najma Sharif", "Najma Sharif Is A Somali-American Writer", "Creative Director Based In Brooklyn.

We must sacrifice together, because we are all in this together, and we will come through together.\u201d\n\nIn times of trouble, a sense of shared peril and common endeavor can remind us that we need one another.\n\nCrises often do bring people together. In times of trouble, a sense of shared peril and common endeavor can remind us that we need one another. The news coverage of the corona crisis is full of stories of tireless neighbors working for their community and ordinary citizens volunteering for dangerous work.\n\nBut crises can also pull people apart. We have already had fierce disagreements over how to respond, over who is suffering the most and who should pay for the recovery. And of course, crises can widen existing partisan, racial and class cleavages.\n\nIn the end, whether a crisis unites or divides probably tells us more about our society than about the crisis itself. We can learn a lot about ourselves in difficult times.\n\nComparison provides some insight. I am an American living in the U.K., so it is natural to compare the two countries and my experiences in each. They have a lot of similarities \u2014 a common language, a shared history and some unhealthy dietary habits.\n\nGet the think newsletter. This site is protected by recaptcha\n\nIn 2016, both countries seemed to enter the populist moment together. An anti-elite insurgency voted for the U.K. to leave the E.U. just five months before a similar sentiment in the U.S. propelled Trump to the presidency. Both countries remain deeply polarized, led by divisive leaders and, of course, both have been hit very hard by the pandemic. As of May 29, they rank No. 1 and 2 in the world in deaths from COVID-19.\n\nCOVID-19 has spawned many controversies in the United Kingdom that would look familiar to Americans. They range from a persistent lack of testing to anger over the neglect of care in nursing homes, where more than a third of U.K. deaths from COVID-19 have occurred.\n\nBut there are subtle yet important differences in the British and American responses to the outbreak. Most tellingly, the virus has not noticeably reinforced partisan divisions in the U.K. Opinion divides sharply over whether Prime Minister Boris Johnson is doing a good job in dealing with the virus, but notably not over the need to fight it and the importance of harsh measures like lockdowns and social distancing.\n\nMost tellingly, the virus has not noticeably reinforced partisan divisions in the U.K.\n\nThere is no British equivalent of the armed lockdown protests that Trump has praised. The largest British anti-lockdown protest consisted of less than 100 (unarmed) conspiracy theorists who seemed most worried about the link between 5G and the virus. It did not inspire any sort of support from political figures in any party.\n\nOne would struggle to define a \u201cConservative\u201d or \u201cLabour\u201d party approach to combating the disease. The labour opposition agrees with the basic premise of the need for a lockdown, social distancing and the importance of testing. And given that the prime minister himself nearly died from the disease, one would be hard pressed to argue that his government is not taking the threat seriously. Rather than quibble over the strategy, the partisan struggle is over who is most competent to manage the response.\n\nThere is no equivalent to the idea, so prevalent in U.S. debate, that the political parties in Britain take fundamentally different approaches to the disease. Democrats in the U.S. broadly favor stricter lockdown measures, more cautious openings and more government action to support those in economic distress, while Republicans favor restarting the economy quicker, accepting greater risk of renewed outbreaks and relying on individual judgment to regulate behavior.\n\nIn short, the greatest national crisis in decades has brought Britain closer together, but it has worsened the already crippling polarization in American politics, with consequences for the response. Partisan divides explain, for example, why the next coronavirus relief package, which both sides agree is needed, is stuck between a Democratic House and a Republican Senate that cannot agree on how to spend the money.\n\nThe difference between unity and division appears to reside in two unique features of the U.S. political scene.\n\nThe first is the geography of partisanship in the United States. The coronavirus, of course, has no partisan leanings but it does appear to like densely packed cities in which it can spread more easily. The most fundamental U.S. political divide is between the big cities and the rural areas. U.S. political institutions reflect this divide. Heavily urban states are usually ruled by Democratic governors, while more rural states tend to have Republican governors. The U.S. Senate, which is heavily weighted to rural votes, is controlled by Republicans while the Democrats control the more proportional House of Representatives.\n\nThis means that the disease has a political geography in the United States. It has disproportionately affected blue states and Democratic voters. The five of the most affected states (measured by cases per capita) all voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016, and seven of them have Democratic governors. Several Republican leaders have described the coronavirus relief efforts as \u201cblue-state bailouts.\u201d\n\nThe second is the nature of leadership. Johnson has had no choice but take responsibility for the pandemic response. Despite some devolution to the regions, Britain remains a very centralized state and there is simply no one else to take the blame or get the credit. Responsibility means that he needs to push consistently for national unity in both speech and deed because it is so critical to an effective response to the virus. His partisan rhetoric, which was fierce during the Brexit debates, has notably abated of late.\n\nTrump has chosen to take advantage of the U.S. federal structure to deny executive office responsibility for the pandemic response.\n\nTrump, by contrast, has chosen to take advantage of the U.S. federal structure to deny executive office responsibility for the pandemic response. This abdication may have some pitfalls for him politically, and it has certainly hardened pre-existing partisan rancor, but it has also freed up him to take partisan shots from the sidelines with little heed to its impact on the effectiveness of the response to the pandemic. Despite his occasional calls for unity he has not hesitated to use the crisis to unleash starkly political attacks. He has targeted blue state governors, Joe Biden, former President Barack Obama and even former President George W. Bush, a fellow Republican, for his message of unity.\n\nThe geographic nature of American partisan divides is a national liability in that it means that unity in crisis is not a given. Whereas after 9/11, politicians used the moment to draw the country together, the pandemic has driven Americans further apart. Unity in difficult times requires leaders willing to take responsibility for national problems and take actions that bring us together.\n\nAmerica\u2019s partisan and geographic divides have steadily grown since 9/11. The U.K. also has brutal partisan divides that have often hobbled policymaking in recent years. But at this difficult moment, a leader that has experienced close up the impact of the virus and an opposition party that takes its role in governance seriously have understood that there are limits to partisanship amid national crises.", "link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/u-k-u-s-are-two-countries-divided-common-plague-ncna1213121", "published": "2020-05-22T20:42:00+00:00", "author": ["Jeremy Shapiro", "Is The Research Director Of The European Council On Foreign Relations.

Thomas Keller, an illustrious chef who happens to own some of the most expensive restaurants in the world, was among 10 hospitality industry chiefs representing every part of American dining \u2014 from Burger King to mom and pop joints to other Michelin Three Stars \u2014 seated with the entire Trump Brain Trust: President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin, the president\u2019s son-in-law and special adviser Jared Kushner and presidential daughter Ivanka Trump, among others.\n\nAt one point, Keller began to speak, gently, to the president, explaining how the flavor of the butter Keller sources from a solitary Vermont farmer with eight cows changes from season to season. \u201cIn the spring when the \u2026 [cows] are grazing on grass, the butter is a beautiful orange hue,\u201d he said. It is unclear what outcome Keller was trying to get with Trump; maybe he thought the idea of Per Se running out of exquisitely-flavored butter would galvanize Trump into action for the nationwide crisis of small family farms facing economic collapse as American restaurants lie dying.\n\nIn any case, Trump was polite but seemed fairly unmoved.\n\nIt was hard not to see that Keller and his cohort of very powerful chef/executives, with their studied calm, smiling faces, are pretty much desperate. It is fair to guess that these men \u2014 and they were all men \u2014 who had clawed their way to the top of the restaurant industry do not usually suffer fools with smiles, or even use their inside voices that much. But they were relaxed and friendly as they each explained that America\u2019s restaurants really, really need smarter federal assistance (and lots more federal money) right now because the industry \u2014 and the many millions of jobs it represents and supports \u2014 are facing catastrophe.\n\nGet the think newsletter. This site is protected by recaptcha\n\nThat restaurants are among the businesses economically hardest hit by COVID-19 has been clear from the beginning of the pandemic. The virus exploits our weak spots: We are highly social creatures who crave gathering together to dine and drink and talk. However, the universal appetite for being together is considerably shaken after months of watching wall-to-wall news coverage of COVID-19\u2019s brutal symptoms, as well as the hideous, lonely deaths it inflicts.\n\nAnd when it comes to going out to eat, it is hard to un-see videos like the terrifying black light experiment filmed by NHK, which show one infected person at a restaurant rapidly, easily and efficiently infecting the other diners and servers with SARS-CoV-2.\n\nFor the people who run and own restaurants now contemplating how to mitigate the dangers inherent in running a dine-in restaurant in the midst of a pandemic of a highly contagious, fatal respiratory disease can, as David Chang said, make your brain bleed. There\u2019s both not enough and too much information: the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines are so inadequate that many states, The James Beard Institute, individual restaurants and even McDonald's are coming out with their own extensive recommendations for re-opening safely. More helpfully, some of the smartest minds in the industry, such as Chang and Tom Colicchio, have started a public dialogue about how dine-in restaurants need to change and evolve if they are going to survive this period of time.\n\nAnd if there is any strong takeaway from Monday\u2019s White House meeting, it seems to be that the big guys will be able to do just that. The Paneras and other chains who had, pre-pandemic, robust takeout and delivery business are apparently thriving. However, sadly, and inevitably, many fine dining restaurants that are trying to pivot to takeout and delivery report they are losing money \u2014 a lot of it.\n\nAnd some of the chef-owners who run the most exclusive, most expensive and often most innovative restaurants in the country are starting to sound like they don\u2019t see how they will survive. In Seattle, the pre-pandemic home to one of the country\u2019s most adventurous, high-end restaurant scenes, some of the city\u2019s most exciting new bo\u00eetes were built around intimate dining experiences \u2014 places that were designed to be small at which guests sit at \u201cchef\u2019s counters\u201d during a few seatings per night. There is no way to effectively sanitize a dining experience that is about physical intimacy and have it remain even vaguely similar.\n\nAnd really, the question has to be asked: Why try?\n\nAs Georgia-based chef Hugh Acheson said to a New York Times reporter: \u201cThere is no fancy meal right now that is worth my people\u2019s health and the health of other people who come into a restaurant.\u201d\n\nWhen surveying the wreckage of the COVID-19 economy, let alone thinking about the thousands of people who now spend hours each week waiting in line at food banks, it\u2019s hard to feel too badly about the existential threat facing the finest, most exclusive restaurants in the country. It\u2019s hard to feel too sorry for the kind of places that can only exist in or near cities that have great wealth, and that have months-long waiting lists and dinners that costs as much as the average American worker earns in a week.\n\nYet, in the same way that a relatively tiny haute couture scene exerts an outsize influence on the global clothing industry, these exclusive, obnoxiously expensive restaurants are often the realized dreams of some of the most gifted, artistic, ambitious, hard-working Americans who come from all social classes. These restaurants and their chefs contribute enormously to the way Americans think, eat, drink, produce food and interact with one another and our environment. And it seems increasingly likely that many, if not all of them, will not return to business after COVID-19.\n\nAlready, there are some who are welcoming the end of high-end dining and feel that the death of \u201cfoodie\u201d culture will lead to a better, less snobbish way of thinking about and eating food. History, however, is not encouraging on this point: During Prohibition, the restaurant industry collapsed when the high profit margins from alcohol sales disappeared. With restaurants shuttered, diners, cafeterias and soda fountains popped up all over the country serving fast food \u2014 or, as the economist Tyler Cowen has pointed out, food that is pleasing to children: sweet, bland, filling. It was comfort food.\n\nMaybe comfort food is what we need right now, to nourish our psyches more than our bodies as we prepare for the upcoming months in a globally persistent pandemic environment. And maybe even the most celebrated chefs know it. For instance, now that Denmark is starting to ease its lockdown restrictions, Ren\u00e9 Redzepi, one of the most celebrated and gastronomically adventurous chefs in the world, has announced he is reopening Noma, his Copenhagen restaurant/foodie Valhalla \u2026 as a burger joint.

When other children were watching Saturday morning cartoons, my family was abstaining from television and participating in prayer services. Despite intense advertising, I never enjoyed a McDonald\u2019s Happy Meal or Lucky Charms cereal. But I learned at an early age that the greatest religious obligation was that of caring for others.

It was Saturday morning during synagogue services. Not one person had a cellphone, wallet or car keys, let alone a car to drive someone to the hospital. In our community, carrying anything on Shabbat, the holy Sabbath, was considered a form of forbidden work. All pockets were literally empty.\n\nThe rabbi acted fast, opening one of the weekday charity boxes and took out a quarter, passing it to someone to use the pay phone in the lobby to call Hatzolah, the Jewish volunteer ambulance service that would typically arrive faster than 911.\n\nGet the think newsletter. This site is protected by recaptcha\n\nI grew up in a Jewish community in Brooklyn, New York, that today would be classified by outsiders as ultra-Orthodox or right-wing Orthodox, but we just thought of ourselves as Jewish. Religious law was the undercurrent of our lives, dictating the food we ate, the clothes we wore, and the days and times when specific prayers would be said. A decommissioned air raid siren would ring through the neighborhood to announce a 10-minute warning before Shabbat would begin, ensuring that no work would happen too close to the sacred day.\n\nOn that Shabbat morning, in that moment of crisis, it never crossed my mind for an instant that our rabbi was diminishing the importance of our Sabbath observance or \u2014 God forbid \u2014 improperly taking money from charity. To the contrary, our Shabbat practice was sacrosanct, and our charity holy, but the obligation to save and protect life overshadowed all.\n\nThe obligation to save and protect life overshadowed all.\n\nToday we find ourselves in a very different crisis, and the risk to life is far more severe, and widespread. As coronavirus began to spread rampantly throughout the United States and across the globe, our synagogues, schools and community institutions closed their doors in an attempt to flatten the curve and decrease the rate of infection. In early April, we celebrated Passover, arguably our most widely celebrated and communal holiday, in isolation. Community leadership encouraged families not to visit with one another or welcome guests into their homes to prevent transmission. And now we are preparing for the upcoming holiday of Shavuot, the day we recall standing together at Mount Sinai to receive the Ten Commandments, the core of our legal tradition, customarily celebrated by gathering in groups and studying together the entire night. Our early sages teach that the ancient Israelite nation congregated together at the foot of the mountain \u201cas one person with one heart\u201d; this year we recount that story in the silos of our separate spaces.\n\nIt is a hardship to be alone, both personally and religiously. But we understand that our faith not only allows for it, it insists upon it to save lives.\n\nFor all these reasons, so many in our Jewish community in Missouri were horrified and heartbroken when Gov. Mike Parson indicated back in April that he did not believe that COVID-19 should be considered a valid excuse to vote absentee. We already knew in-person voting carried risk of transmission; we had seen the news reports indicating that Wisconsin had at least 40 people who voted or worked in their recent elections later diagnosed with the coronavirus. The thought that any person would have to risk their health to exercise their right to vote felt simultaneously antithetical to our identities, both as Jews and as Americans.\n\nWhile the governor might not have initially accepted the pandemic as an excuse for absentee voting, Missouri allows for religious belief or practice as one of the six reasons one may vote absentee. For us the argument could not have been clearer.\n\nThe thought that any person would have to risk their health to exercise their right to vote felt simultaneously antithetical to our identities: both as Jews and as Americans.\n\nWorking through my organization, the Jewish Community Relations Council of St. Louis, and partnering with the St. Louis Rabbinical and Cantorial Association and the Rabbinical Association of Greater Kansas City, we began to convene our Jewish clergy. With the early memory of that Shabbat morning in my mind, and the actions of my esteemed rabbi to save one person, I drafted a text for us all to sign rooted in the text that has guided my life since childhood. \u201cThe Torah instructs: \u2018Neither shall you stand by the blood of your neighbor\u2019 (Leviticus 19:16). When the life of any person is in danger, almost all other religious laws become inapplicable.\u201d With the voices of my teachers resounding in my ears, I wrote: \u201cOur rabbis teach us that to save one life is to save an entire world, and to destroy one life is to destroy an entire world. Indeed, every person has the potential to create a universe and the loss of any person is immeasurable.\u201d\n\nOn May 4, we published an open letter with signatures from 37 Jewish religious leaders. The list spanned the geography of the state of Missouri and included voices from every denomination within the Jewish community. The letter stated unequivocally that we \u201cbelieve therefore that it is a deeply held religious belief to remain home on days in which elections are held and that such a belief qualifies one under the Missouri law to vote in any regional, state, or federal elections via absentee ballot.\u201d (In recent days there has been movement on the part of legislators to somewhat relax these rules. But new regulations have yet to be signed by the governor).\n\nReligious freedom in America of late has been wielded as a political tool. There are those who want to abuse this freedom for personal benefits or selfish interests. There are those who want to claim the religious sphere as the exclusive purview of the right or the left. Yet, religion belongs to neither. It does not dictate a party or a candidate. Religion calls upon us to care for one another. The rest, to paraphrase the great early rabbi, Hillel, is just commentary.\n\nThere is nothing about this crisis that is easy or simple. I long for the days when my children can return to playdates with their friends, when I can sit across from a colleague at a caf\u00e9, when my family can take a vacation. But growing up in the Orthodox Jewish community, I learned early in life that my faith tradition was not about what was easy, what was convenient, or even what I wanted for myself. Life in community requires recognition of the needs of the entire community.

Hospitals are completely unprepared for this pandemic and are begging for help.\u201d\n\nWhile the average person cannot provide the things hospitals in the thick of COVID-19 most desperately need, such as intensive care unit beds and ventilators, physicians on the front lines insist that there are still steps we can take to be of service.\n\nHere are nine ways you can help hospital workers right now.\n\nThe best thing you can do is stay home\n\n\u201cI cannot underscore how important it is for people to stay home during this period of social distancing,\u201d says Dr. Tamara Moise, lead physician at Big Apple Urgent Care and an ER doctor at a hospital in Brooklyn that has been hit hard by COVID-19 cases. \u201cThe best way to help medical staff is to avoid getting sick. You\u2019ve heard it over and over again, but it bears repeating, you may not exhibit symptoms but you may still be capable of passing the virus on to someone who will get very sick. Please do not go outside if you absolutely do not have to.\u201d\n\nIf you feel sick, use a self-triage tool or call your provider rather than rushing to the hospital\n\nIf you think you may have COVID-19, don\u2019t just rush to the hospital \u2014 self-quarantine and use a self-triage tool like C19check.com.\n\n\u201cWe designed C19check.com at Emory so that people can have an easy-to-use, evidence-based tool to better assess their symptoms and determine what actions they should take,\u201d says Dr. Justin Schrager, an ER doctor at Emory University Hospital and an assistant professor of emergency medicine at Emory University\u2019s School of Medicine. \u201cIn order to alleviate the pressure that hospitals are currently under, we ask that people self-assess their risk before heading to the emergency room.\u201d\n\nMoise adds that if you do experience mild symptoms, \u201ccalling your primary care doctor, an urgent care or making a telemedicine appointment with an urgent care facility are the best ways to go.\u201d\n\nMake a monetary donation to a nonprofit hospital\n\nIn a time of historic financial uncertainty and mass layoffs, many of us are in budget mode with no cash to spare \u2014 but if you do have some extra money, consider donating to a nonprofit hospital.\n\n\u201cSome hospitals have specific COVID-19 funds, but even if you don\u2019t donate to these, your donation to a nonprofit hospital goes to the running of the institution,\u201d Moise says. \u201cYour dollars can help a hospital pay for meals for medical staff, or even pay for protective gear. So please, donate where you can.\u201d\n\nDr. Shruti Gohil, associate medical director, epidemiology and infection prevention, and an assistant professor in the division of infectious diseases at University of California Irvine Health, seconds the call for donations. \u201cHospitals will know how best to allocate funds according to the local needs, which are subject to change with time as the pandemic progresses,\u201d she says.\n\nGet the better newsletter.

Here\u2019s the center's list.\n\nCall hospitals and/or physicians to ask what they need and look into local donation drives. \u201cHere in New Jersey, the county sheriff's office or the county executive has been running drives for [PPE] and other gear to address shortages,\u201d Michael Avaltroni, dean of the Fairleigh Dickinson University School of Pharmacy & Health Sciences, says. \u201cIf you stockpiled on N95 masks or hand sanitizer, so long as it\u2019s unopened and in good condition, you can donate it to someone on the front lines.\u201d\n\nNote that if you\u2019re in an area that has not been badly affected by COVID-19, a donation drive will still see that your unused supplies get into the hands that need it. \u201cIt could be an EMT helping someone in respiratory distress \u2014 their risk to exposure is as high as anyone else\u2019s and they need proper equipment.\u201d\n\n#GetUsPPE, a new initiative run by medical workers, engineers and volunteers that is helping to organize demands for gear in hospitals is a great resource for assessing donation needs and finding drop-off points. Check out their map here and follow them on Twitter here.\n\nSew masks\n\nA handmade or sewn mask does not meet PPE standards, and even N95 masks are \u201cnot one-size-fits-all and should be properly fitted on an individual basis,\u201d Avaltroni said. \u201cBut we\u2019re in a war zone mindset right now where anything is better than nothing.\u201d\n\nSo, by all means, keep sewing those masks and donating them in the organized way you would other supplies.\n\nGot free time and in-demand skills? Ask your hospital how you can volunteer\n\n\u201cIf you have any specific skills that could be useful, let your hospital know,\u201d Gohil says. \u201cExamples: You\u2019re an engineer and can generate a prototype of a face shield for 3-D printing. You are a great communicator on the phone \u2013 maybe you can offer your services to help the hospital answer patient questions. You speak another language and can help translate a sign or communications that your hospital needs to reach out to a specific community.\u201d\n\nRun essential errands for higher-risk people\n\nThough COVID-19 is potentially lethal to anybody, it is far more likely to cause serious problems and fatality in older people, as well as folks who are immunocompromised. If you know someone nearby who is considered high-risk, lend them a helping hand. Do their grocery shopping or whatever else you can do to ensure they stay home. It\u2019s a good deed that will not only make you feel useful in a time when you might be feeling helpless, but also a small step to \u201cminimize the risk that others get sick, and that helps everyone including our hospitals,\u201d Gohil says.\n\nSending food to hospitals is great \u2014 just be organized about it\n\nProviding hospitals and urgent care centers with tasty takeout helps keep workers fed and also gives much needed support to restaurants that have been devastated by social distancing measures. But please, don\u2019t send food without coordinating it with the hospital first.\n\n\u201cIt's complicated because sometimes you can bring more chaos into a high-traffic and high-intensity environment by doing these well-intentioned things like ordering food delivery,\u201d Avaltroni says.\n\nCheck out Feeding The Frontline, a grassroots initiative connecting people with restaurants to help not only medical workers, but also vulnerable populations and families who typically depend on schools for meals. You can also make a donation to Frontline Foods, which has launched a Covid Clinician Meal Support Program. As of April 1, they\u2019ve raised $700,000 and delivered over 7,300 meals throughout 13 cities.\n\nSchedule blood donations and give hospitals one less thing to worry about\n\nAlong with surges of COVID-19 cases and shortages of PPE, hospitals are also dealing with relatively normal needs \u2014 such as maintaining a stable supply of blood for trauma victims, cancer patients and anyone else who requires a transfusion.\n\n\u201cWe really need people to schedule to give blood [this month],\" Anthony Tornetta, spokesperson for the American Red Cross, says noting that there\u2019s concern over a dip in blood supply as soon as mid-April. \u201cDonating blood doesn\u2019t require giving any money, and blood drives, which are considered essential business, are taking extra steps to stagger appointments, enhance social distancing and make sure everyone who comes in and out stays safe and healthy. Please schedule an appointment in advance at RedCrossBlood.org and give hospitals one less thing to worry about.\u201d\n\nWant more tips like these?

Since \u201cshelter-in-place\u201d orders forced her to temporarily close her massage therapy business, she has had to lay off over 30 employees and nearly a dozen independent contractors.\n\n\u201cI have only been able to keep two salaried employees on\", she says.\n\nWith no precise ETA on when doors can reopen, businesses like Beider\u2019s are in danger of closing forever \u2014 a loss not only for workers and their communities, but also for the American job market at large. According to the Office of Advocacy of the U.S. Small Business Administration, small businesses account for 44 percent of economic activity.\n\nIn addition to state and federal aid, small businesses need our support right now. Here are 11 ways consumers can help.\n\n1. Buy a $10 gift card for a friend \u2014 and encourage them to buy for someone else\n\n\u201cPurchasing gift cards is a great idea for businesses that you are going to use anyway,\u201d says Dennis Shirshikov, an economic analyst at Fit Small Business. \u201cIt gives [businesses] like salons and yoga studios some cash to support employees and reassures them that they will still have customers.\u201d\n\nIf you have the means, think of approaching gift cards like you would a chain letter. Send a $5 or $10 gift card to your favorite business to a local friend, and then ask them to do the same for another business.\n\n\u201cIf every customer purchased a $10 gift card to give to a friend that didn't have any prior awareness of the business before, that person who received the gift card is more likely to purchase at least one time, then depending on their experience and satisfaction, become a repeat customer over time,\u201d says Latrice Love, founder of the vegan beauty brand Liplove, who normally relies on pop-ups and other now-canceled events to sell products and gain brand recognition. \u201cThis can create a ripple effect on customer acquisition and retention over time.\u201d\n\n2. Order takeout \u2014 it\u2019s deemed safe by experts\n\nOrdering takeout is one of the best ways to support restaurants right now, and provided you wash your hands thoroughly before and after eating, there is no added cause for concern over COVID-19 contamination.\n\nJames Henry Dunne, assistant professor in the department of hospitality studies at the New York Institute of Technology, notes that even restaurants that traditionally don\u2019t offer pickup or delivery are getting in on the action. Where the law permits (or has been loosened, as in New York), many restaurants are also touting alcoholic beverages along with to-go meals, \u201cand in some cases even selling grocery items like paper goods and cuts of beef, on an informal basis,\u201d he says.\n\n3. Salons are selling DIY kits, virtual consultations and \u2018buying time\u2019 promos\n\nGet the better newsletter. This site is protected by recaptcha\n\nIf you\u2019re overdue for a hair treatment but the salon is closed, check to see if they are providing virtual consultations and/or custom color kits.\n\n\u201cThe salon I go to just announced it would create custom color kits for clients, providing everything they need to touch up, plus FaceTime support,\u201d says Kristen Elworthy, founder of Seven Hills Communications, a marketing firm that works with small businesses. \u201cAll these things can be picked up or dropped off curbside.\u201d\n\nDanielle Cohen-Shohet, CEO of GlossGenius, a company specializing in software solutions for small businesses, sees salons getting creative with promotions, including offering customers the option of \u201cbuying time\u201d, meaning \u201ca gift card will increase in value every month from April to July.\u201d Salons are also offering virtual web consultations and whatever else might help keep that vital connection with their clientele alive. Reach out to your stylist directly or tap into \u201clocal social media to learn about promotions that salons are doing,\u201d she says.\n\n4. Social media shoutouts are free. Give them generously.\n\n\u201cWith more businesses going digital and needing to build traction, \u2018liking\u2019, commenting, reposting, tagging us in your purchases and unboxing videos [on social media] really helps with engagement, which, in turn, leads to more visibility and sales,\u201d Love says.\n\nSocial media plugs are a free way to show your support and the payoff is almost instantaneous. \u201c[Liplove] has seen a significant increase in engagement and shares as our customers began to promote our messages of love and empowerment to their networks during this season. This has caused a boost in not only traffic to our website that originated from social media, but also from organic search.\u201d\n\n5. Refill booze \u2014 and hand sanitizer \u2014 from local distilleries\n\nWith hand sanitizer sold out just about everywhere, various distilleries have stepped up to meet the demand. Crater Lake Spirits in Oregon, has made complimentary sanitizer available to customers, a spokesperson for the brand confirms. Rollins Distillery in Gulf Breeze, Florida is giving hand sanitizer away on a first come, first serve basis. So, next time you\u2019re looking to stock up your liquor cabinet, call your local distillery to see if they can also throw in some hand sanitizer. Plan to get there early and to BYOB (bring your own bottle).\n\n6. Need soap? Visit a local artisan\u2019s site\n\n\u201cRemember: You don't have to visit a physical store to shop at a local business,\u201d says Michael Bonebright, senior blog editor at DealNews. \u201cMany small stores have websites that take online orders. Mega-retailers like Amazon are struggling to keep up with demand for important items like soap, so check in with local artisans in your area. You have to wash your hands more often anyway, so why not treat yourself to handmade soap?\u201d\n\n7. Shop at niche groceries and sign up for a CSA to support local farms\n\n\u201cIf you're finding empty shelves and long lines at big retailers, please think about whether there is a small niche market nearby that you could support instead \u2014 especially if it's a local market that supports local farms,\u201d says Mike Geller of Mike's Organic market in Stamford, Connecticut. \u201cA lot of farms rely significantly on business from restaurants, so getting more orders from the local grocer will help to offset some of the setback. One practical way to give back and support the farms is to sign up for a CSA, or community supported agriculture. We are offering our customers the opportunity this year to sign up for a CSA which will provide them with local and seasonal food throughout the entire summer and fall and in turn guarantees many small farmers a source of revenue throughout the growing season. It also supports our business as a small grocer in the community.\u201d\n\n8. Many indie bookshops are still fulfilling orders\n\nMegan Birch-McMichael, manager of Silver Unicorn Bookstore in Acton, Massachusetts, is used to selling books onsite, but since COVID-19 forced the shop to shut its doors for the time being, she\u2019s shifted to online sales.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been offering free media mail shipping and local delivery,\u201d Birch-McMichael says. \u201cWe have a ton of curated lists and book bundles on the website. We also have a weekly newsletter that details upcoming new releases and other information. For now, the community has responded positively and we\u2019re so grateful.\u201d\n\nSign up for your local bookstore\u2019s newsletters and follow them on social media to learn how they\u2019re handling orders. You might also consider buying via Bookshop.org, Indiebound.org and Libro.fm (for audiobooks) to help support indie bookstores.\n\n9. Donate your expertise with a free consultation\n\n\u201cBusiness owners need legal, accounting and insurance help negotiating issues, outstanding debts and granular disputes,\u201d Baron Christopher Hanson, lead consultant and owner of RedBaron Consulting, says. \u201cIf you are a CEO, CFO or in-house lawyer stuck at home, try calling your favorite local businesses to simply consult with them, help answer pressing questions and alleviate fears.\u201d\n\n10. Been meaning to leave a positive review? Now\u2019s the time to do it.\n\n\u201cPeople have more time to leave positive reviews and personal testimonies on Yelp, Google and other online platforms,\u201d Elina Fedotova, owner of Elina Organics in Chicago and Kalamazoo, Michigan, says. \u201cThat can help to direct new clients to [the business].\n\nLove adds that a glowing review also \u201chelps us business owners stay sane by putting a smile on our faces\u201d.\n\n11. Be patient. We\u2019re all adjusting to this new normal.\n\n\u201cThe pandemic has disrupted nearly everything for businesses \u2014 including supply chains, vendor reliability and employee productivity,\u201d says Abhi Lokesh, CEO of Fracture, a small business focused on photo decor in Gainesville, Florida. \u201cMuch of the business world is scrambling to keep things together and adjust to this new normal. It's always uplifting and morale boosting when we hear from customers who are empathetic to what we're going through.\u201d\n\nWant more tips like these?

Also, having multiple other chronic diseases can complicate this virus.\u201d\n\nAs Dr. Ria Paul, geriatrician at Stanford Health Care underscores, the best thing seniors can do right now is to hunker down in self-isolation and practice social distancing, but we must recognize that this is a lot to ask. \u201cI have patients who haven\u2019t left their home at all in six weeks,\u201d says Paul. \u201cI applaud them for that, but living in lockdown mode can be challenging.\u201d\n\nFortunately, there are steps that younger people can take to help seniors cope right now, just as there are ways we can serve elderly communities at large, including nursing homes which have been dubbed \u201cground zero\u201d for the pandemic as COVID-19-related death rates soar.\n\nHere\u2019s what experts recommend:\n\nLimit your own risk to infection and spreading\n\nFirst and foremost, Dr. Paul says we must also practice self-isolation and social distancing. We shouldn\u2019t be in any physical contact with seniors at this time unless we\u2019re caregivers, in which case we need to treat our own bodies as though they\u2019re an extension of the senior\u2019s we\u2019re caring for.\n\n\u201cIt's a paradigm,\u201d says Paul. \u201cIf you\u2019re a caregiver for a senior, you have to be responsible for yourself and do everything you can to prevent [contracting] and transmitting the virus. This is the most important thing.\u201d\n\nTake the time to teach seniors how to get better at technology\n\n\u201cWhen I call my patients, they\u2019re so happy to hear my voice,\u201d says Paul. \u201cThey ask me how I am doing and they want to prolong the conversation. I will ask them, \u2018Do you have a smartphone?\u2019 And many of them do, but haven\u2019t used FaceTime before. Once I tell them about it, they are surprised by how easy it is. A big thing we can do as a community is to help seniors stay connected digitally. Now is a time to practice social distancing but [also a time to discourage] social isolation by helping seniors become better at technology.\u201d\n\n\"Like all people, seniors are vulnerable to seeing and believing misinformation about COVID-19 on the internet and their social media feeds,\u201d says Valerie Earnshaw, a social psychologist and assistant professor of human development and education at the University of Delaware. \u201cWe know that people who believe more misinformation are less likely to follow public health recommendations to protect themselves and others from this virus.\u201d\n\nEarnshaw, who co-authored a new paper in the Journal of the American Medical Association on the need to combat COVID-19 misinformation, finds that \u201cluckily, even people who believe misinformation about COVID-19 trust information about COVID-19 from their doctors.\u201d So, if your elderly loved one isn\u2019t taking the coronavirus seriously, have their doctor step in. \u201cMany doctors and other healthcare professionals are taking time to talk with people who are at greater risk of COVID-19 complications to address their concerns \u2014 and it's just one more thing for us all to be grateful to them for during this time.\"\n\nGet the better newsletter. This site is protected by recaptcha\n\nBe the person they can vent to \u2014 this is an incredibly hard time for them\n\nSeniors not only worry about their own lives, they\u2019re concerned about their peers, and many have already lost friends to COVID-19. Encourage them to open up about their feelings.\n\n\u201cMind and body go hand in hand,\u201d says Paul. \u201cIf our patients are depressed, they may stop eating or drinking and then the physical health part goes in a downward spiral.\u201d\n\nElizabeth St. John, a licensed clinical social worker at Stanford Health Care who often works with Dr. Paul, adds that seniors need to talk to people who \u201ccan just listen and validate their feelings. Be the person who will bear witness to their sadness, stress and anxiety and who will let them reminisce because this is a really sad time.\u201d\n\nRemember that you needn\u2019t take on the position of being their emotional support system all by yourself (again, keep yourself healthy first!). Enlist other family and friends to check in, too. \u201cMy patients love when they hear from someone they haven\u2019t heard from in a while,\u201d says Paul, who adds that organizing virtual group hangouts is also important right now, particularly if the senior in your life is used to attending church or other social gatherings.", "link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/better/lifestyle/coronavirus-pandemic-how-help-senior-citizens-ncna1190591", "published": "2020-04-24T18:03:00+00:00", "author": []}, {"title": "How to help the unemployed during the coronavirus pandemic", "text": "In the past four weeks, 22 million Americans have filed jobless claims. That staggering number doesn\u2019t even reflect everyone who is truly out of work \u2014 just those who have been able to get online and file for unemployment benefits.\n\nBut not all hope is lost. There are ways to help, even if you\u2019ve been laid off yourself. Here are a few steps you can take to ease the burden.\n\nIf someone you know has been laid off:\n\n1. Don\u2019t assume you know what they need\n\nEveryone\u2019s situation is a little different, and your perception of a person\u2019s needs may not actually be what they are. Amanda Clayman, a psychotherapist and financial wellness advocate at Prudential, says that losing work isn\u2019t a problem that can be solved overnight. \u201cSometimes [our assumptions] may be very wrong, and it\u2019s more likely that they will take the shape of our own fears of what they want from us,\u201d she says.\n\nClayman says a healthy way to ask what your loved one needs is to listen to your conversations and see what they bring up, whether it is emotional or financial support. Not all help is financial, of course \u2014 especially if you are also struggling. \u201cIf your friend is in a bad place and you want to help, you can say, \u2018I want to help, but I\u2019m worried about the position I\u2019m in, too,\u2019\u201d Clayman advises.\n\n2. Be there for them \u2014 again and again\n\nGet the better newsletter. This site is protected by recaptcha\n\nThis period of self\u2014isolation can be pretty lonely, and not everyone will need the same kind of interaction. As with many kinds of crises, including death, job loss and illness, Clayman says that loss of friendship is a painful part. \u201cWe are afraid of being overwhelmed, we don\u2019t know what to say, we don\u2019t have the power to fix it,\u201d she says.\n\nNot every conversation needs to be about the biggest things that are going on. \u201cYou can send a funny meme or a gif,\u201d Clayman says. \u201cSignaling your availability is the most important thing to do, even if [the interaction] didn\u2019t go as you hoped.\u201d\n\n3. Respect your loved one\u2019s boundaries \u2014 and your own\n\nIf you want to help someone you\u2019re close to, you need to be in tune with their needs and boundaries as well as yours, according to Clayman. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean we have to react or overreact, but we can recognize the boundary and identify what that feeling is.\u201d\n\nIf you are living with a roommate, family, member or partner who has been laid off, make sure that you can take space from each other by talking to friends to express your worry in a healthy way. If you can get a little physical space, by taking a walk or exercising safely outside, take advantage of that opportunity.\n\nIf you want to help those in your community who are out of work:\n\n1. Check in with your neighbors\n\nIf you already know your neighbors, feel free to offer help with things like groceries or errands, if you can. If not, offering items may be a better approach than offering financial support out of the blue.\n\nIf you live in a big city and don\u2019t know your neighbors, social media apps like Nextdoor can help connect you to other home-bound residents. You can also use traditional social media apps like Facebook, Twitter and Instagram to see if there are others in your area that are in need. Additionally, if you can\u2019t donate financially, you may be able to donate unwanted goods through apps like Freecycle or the Buy Nothing Project.\n\n2. Donate to your community foundations\n\nDemetra Nightingale, a labor and employment researcher and fellow at the Urban Institute, says there\u2019s a great need for community organizations that provide social services as well as employment help. \u201cDonations of food, supplies or donations of financial resources, or a donation of time, that\u2019s important,\u201d she tells NBC News. She notes that some of those organizations may have been left out of federal relief funding and donations matter now more than ever.\n\nIf you do have the means to lend financial support, you can do so through local food banks or community organizations that help people in need. Follow the #ShareMyCheck initiative on social media for ideas on where to donate, if you are financially stable and can do so.\n\n3. Offer your own expertise pro bono\n\nWhether or not you\u2019re still employed, you might have some skills that someone else needs. \u201cThis is a good time to prepare for the future if you\u2019re unemployed,\u201d Nightingale says. You can offer to review resumes, help the older or less computer-savvy file for unemployment benefits online or give whatever you\u2019ve got. \u201cWhether it is legal help, teaching or tutoring, or group instruction, that can be shared more broadly in our communities,\u201d Nightingale adds.\n\nWant more tips like these?

But perhaps few have been as greatly affected as Asian American businesses, which saw drops in customers as high as 80 percent long before the U.S. began its push for isolation, as stigma surrounding the virus kept customers out of Chinatowns and Chinese restaurants.\n\nNow, as isolation has led to loss of employment and further stagnation of business for many Asian Americans, initiatives at the city and state level seek to provide financial support for struggling Asian American communities. And as reports of racism and hostility continue to rise as a result of the virus \u2014 with one organization reporting over 1,100 reports of verbal harassment, shunning and physical assault in just two weeks \u2014 some groups are working to raise awareness of the issue.\n\nHere are a few ways you can get involved:\n\nHelp for New York\u2019s Chinatown\n\nIn New York City, home to several of the country\u2019s largest Chinatowns, a new grassroots initiative seeks to help boost restaurants\u2019 business as their sales continue to suffer.

Bibliotherapy dates back to 1916 \u2014 it\u2019s first recorded use was in an article from \u201cThe Atlantic\u201d titled \u201cA Literary Clinic\u201d \u2014 but cinematherapy is a more recent phenomenon, with Dr. Gary Soloman, a Las Vegas-based practitioner, widely credited with coining the term in his 1995 book \u201cThe Motion Picture Prescription: Watch this Movie and Call Me in the Morning.\u201d\n\nWhile these methods have not yet been fully embraced by the traditional field of psychology, a handful of book and cinema therapists, including Perman, say this type of therapy can help people cope as society is collectively racked with feelings of anxiety about growing diagnoses and death tolls, economic uncertainty and community lockdowns.\n\n\u201cReading the right book at the right time can make you feel seen,\u201d Rosalie Knecht, a therapist and author of the novels \u201cWho is Vera Kelly?\u201d and \u201cRelief Map,\u201d said in an interview. \u201cThe thing about narrative is that it gives a way of thinking of hardship as having a purpose to it, and I think that\u2019s a huge reason why we turn to books and movies, especially in difficult moments.\u201d\n\nLet our news meet your inbox. The news and stories that matters, delivered weekday mornings. This site is protected by recaptcha\n\nWhat to read and watch\n\nEven as many agree that books, movies, television, podcasts and video games can provide a welcome distraction during the global pandemic \u2014 as evinced by the onslaught of lists recommending which media people should consume during quarantine \u2014 the volume of options can be overwhelming and sometimes conflicting. Dystopian books and \u201cpandemic literature\u201d like Ling Ma\u2019s \u201cSeverance\u201d and Emily St. John Mandel\u2019s \u201cStation Eleven\u201d have garnered renewed interest during the outbreak, but does reading about plagues run counter to alleviating anxiety?\n\nAccording to Knecht, not quite.\n\n\u201cPeople tend to go one or two ways. They\u2019ll either read a bunch of dystopian fiction or they\u2019re going to read something that provides a complete escape,\u201d Knecht said. \u201cThere\u2019s no right way. Sometimes it can be helpful to lean into whatever\u2019s scary \u2014 it\u2019s like scratching an itch \u2014 but for other people that would just compound their anxiety.\u201d\n\nFor those readers looking for a diversion from all of the news, Knetcht recommends, \u201cLook Alive Out There,\u201d a collection of essays by Sloane Crosley, which she calls a \u201chumorous reminder of the recent past before the outbreak.\u201d\n\nFor those who are interested in leaning into things and reading about plagues, she says they should pick up Hilary Mantel\u2019s \u201cWolf Hall\u201d trilogy and \u201cA Distant Mirror: The Calamitous 14th Century.\u201d Not only are the books long and immersive, but even though they are set in plague times, they are \u201cfar-removed from the current moment,\u201d which she says can be \u201cgrounding\u201d for readers and help put things in perspective.\n\nWhile fiction books are also book therapist Bijal Shah\u2019s prescriptions of choice \u2014 she recommends Madeline Miller\u2019s \u201cCirce,\u201d an epic based on Greek mythology, and \u201cA Man Called Ove,\u201d a Swedish novel about a solitary elderly man who finds connection when a family moves into the house next door \u2014 Shah said not to discount nonfiction books, particularly those about maintaining mental health in trying times. Among her top picks for clients are \u201cMy Age of Anxiety\u201d by Scott Stossel, a memoir chronicling one man\u2019s experience with the disorder and the broader history of the diagnostic category, and Sheryl Sandberg\u2019s \u201cOption B,\u201d as it grapples with loss and bereavement.\n\nAs for movie options, Perman often finds himself recommending the 2011 film \u201cThe Tree of Life,\u201d a movie about a man who tried to make sense of his contentious relationship with his father, while also wrestling with existential questions about life\u2019s meaning and his purpose.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s endlessly interpretive and means different things to different people,\u201d Perman said. \u201cThere\u2019s just no way to engage with that movie and not have thoughts, even if the thought is, \u2018What is this?\u2019\u201d\n\nHe also suggests \u201cWild Strawberries,\u201d \u201cEternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\u201d and any of Charlie Kaufman\u2019s movies because they \u201cdeal with loneliness and existentialism, which are prevalent themes in society, especially now.\u201d\n\nA potential opportunity for embracing art as a viable form of therapy\n\nShah, who worked for more than a decade in investment banking before switching to bibliotherapy in 2017, said books are a useful tool because they can illuminate truths that a one-hour therapy session may not be able to.\n\n\u201cI would turn to books to understand a concept better and characters who had been through similar situations would help shed light on my own circumstances,\u201d Shah said. \u201cFor example, when it came to discussing boundary setting with my therapist, the one-hour sessions weren\u2019t enough for me, but reading books outside of session would close the gap and make all the difference in terms of me being able to apply the concept in my life.\u201d\n\nTeena Collins, an Oklahoma-based cinematherapist, feels similarly about film\u2019s \u201cability to allow people to see how problems can be solved in positive and constructive ways.\u201d\n\n\u201cIdentifying with a movie character can be very therapeutic and healing,\u201d Collins told NBC News. \u201cSometimes it is difficult for clients to even identify what issues are causing them discomfort, until they see another person experiencing the same thing. They might be in denial that anything is even disrupting their life.\u201d\n\nAnother major benefit of these therapeutic tools, according to Perman, is that while they are more effective when working with a professional, they can also aid those who don\u2019t have access to a therapist. The key, Perman says, is to make sure not just to spend time watching feel-good films \u2014 although he says these movies certainly have their place in cinematherapy \u2014 but to set aside some time to watch films that inspire you to reflect.\n\n\u201cRight now, there\u2019s a lot of things people have to navigate; we\u2019re adjusting to a whole new way of living,\u201d Perman said. \u201cSo I imagine for the most part people are currently understanding cinematherapy in the context of \u2018I need something to take my mind off things,\u2019 but I anticipate as this pandemic goes on we\u2019ll need to find more sustainable ways to adapt. People will move out of the \u2018I just want something to make me feel good\u2019 and hopefully start using cinematherapy more.\u201d", "link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/pop-culture-news/book-cinema-therapists-share-their-prescriptions-surviving-coronavirus-quarantine-n1170516", "published": "2020-03-29T12:44:00+00:00", "author": ["Gwen Aviles", "Gwen Aviles Is A Trending News", "Culture Reporter For Nbc News."]}, {"title": "Here's how to stay productive \u2014 and connected \u2014 when you work from home", "text": "Even before the coronavirus, the number of remote workers has been on the rise, with some 70 percent of the workforce operating out of the office at least one day a week. An adaptable work arrangement that enables one to work from home or a co-working space isn\u2019t just a perk; for many it\u2019s a demand: in a new survey, FlexJobs found that 30 percent of respondents left a job because it didn\u2019t offer such flexibility, while 80 percent said they\u2019d be more loyal to their employer were they given more flexibility, including the option to work from home.\n\nIt\u2019s been more than four years since I left the land of cubicles and keycards and embarked on fulltime freelance self-employment. I don\u2019t miss most aspects of office life, yet sometimes, I find myself nostalgic for the notion of gung-ho solidarity and team spirit that working in a shared space with colleagues can provide. It\u2019s not uncommon for me to look up from my computer, see that it\u2019s 5pm, and rather than feel that old little stir of excitement that the work day is almost over, experience a bolt of dread in realizing that it\u2019s been 8 hours since I talked to another human being in real life.\n\nIn his recent book \u201cBack to Human: How Great Leaders Create Connection in the Age of Isolation\u201d, Dan Schawbel highlights the rise of remote work as a potentially harmful trend in the modern workplace. Among his key conclusions (largely based on interviews with numerous managers at major companies such as American Express and Intuit) \u2014 is that the more we work apart, the less we work together, and this can hinder both our productivity and our sense of community.\n\nThe remote life is liberating, but it can be lonely\n\n\u201cPeople talk about the freedom of working remote, but not the cost,\u201d Schawbel says. \u201cThere is a dark side of working remote and that's the loneliness [stemming] from lack of interaction. Remote workers are more likely to quit because of loneliness and low engagement. One study found that a third of employees globally work remote always or very often, and two-thirds of them aren\u2019t engaged. Only five percent of remote workers always or very often see themselves working at their company for their entire career compared to 28 percent who never work remote.\u201d\n\nSchawbel isn\u2019t arguing that managers summon employees back to their cubicles (as some behemoth companies like IBM have done in recent years), but he does see a need for a stronger bond between the employee and their workplace.\n\n\u201cWhat I'm saying here is a reminder that human connection is important,\u201d Schawbel says. \u201cIf you feel lonely as a worker, you can't do your best work because psychologically a need is not met.\u201d\n\n10 ways to maintain strong relationships while working remotely\n\n1. Fewer emails, more face time\n\n\u201c[So much of] communication is non-verbal,\u201d says Schawbel. \u201cYou get a better feel of how someone is in person. If you're sending tons of emails, it's almost a reflection that you're not getting your point across. People may take you the wrong way or get confused.\u201d\n\nThe simple solution to this is to up your face time with peers and managers, even if you\u2019re using technology to do that.\n\n\u201cThere is a big difference between being able to walk over to someone's office for a quick chat or question versus scheduling time for a call. Doing meetings and calls via video or FaceTime to stay connected and on point helps,\u201d says Diane Stadlen, director of agency services at Sakas & Company. \u201cYou also have the option with a video call to share screens if there are questions. If there are opportunities to have face-to-face days in the office take them \u2014 we all still need that human connection.\u201d\n\n2. Be proactive with your boss by scheduling one-on-one time\n\nAs a remote worker, I often feel like I\u2019m bothering my managers by asking for time with them. It\u2019s hard to read the room when you\u2019re not in it, and I never know whether I\u2019m interrupting something important. The trick here is to schedule recurring one-on-one time with your boss.\n\n\u201cBe proactive even more than you would be in the office,\u201d says Vicki Salemi, career expert for Monster. \u201cSchedule time on your boss's calendar to catch up once a week (even if it's a 15-minute call just to check in). You don't want to be out of sight, out of mind when working remotely, and that's why it's important to keep both communication and rapport in motion.\u201d\n\nGet the better newsletter.

Match your work schedules with colleagues\n\n\u201cIf everyone in your office works on the west coast and you\u2019re based in New York, consider trying to adjust your work schedule so more of your day overlaps with the rest of the office,\u201d says Emily Price, author of \u201cProductivity Hacks: 500+ Easy Ways to Accomplish More at Work \u2014 That Actually Work!\u201d. \u201cWhile there are jobs that might require you to work that \u2018east coast shift,\u2019 if yours isn\u2019t one of them it can be useful to spend at least a few days a week working the same hours as your co-workers. Working the same hours can help the rest of the team get to know you, and can help everyone work together more efficiently.\u201d\n\n4. Stay connected with at least one co-worker via video chat\n\nOccasionally I miss swiveling in my chair and asking the writer or editor beside me a quick question. While this kind of spur of the moment interaction may be difficult, it\u2019s not impossible.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re working with another person regularly, consider spending a few hours of the day connected to that person via video chat,\u201d says Price. \u201cVideo chat will allow you to ask questions and communicate with that person just as if you were both in the same room. Having a bit of face-to-face time can help you feel more connected to the office, and can make your interactions with the person you\u2019re chatting with go much smoother.\u201d\n\nPro tip: If video chatting with a colleague isn\u2019t an option, Price recommends checking out FocusMate, a site where remote workers video chat with a stranger in the same boat for an hour such that you\u2019re one another\u2019s accountability partners for that time.\n\n\u201cYou start the hour by telling each other what you plan on working on and end it by letting each other know how you did,\u201d Price says.\n\n5. Even a small space needs work boundaries\n\nI don\u2019t miss being in a cubicle, but I do miss being in a space with defined work boundaries. (I\u2019m presently working in bed, which is a very big no-no, but I\u2019m blaming a pulled hamstring). Even in a small apartment or a co-working space that is always changing, remote workers should clearly define their workspace.\n\n\u201cA common barrier to productivity that I\u2019ve witnessed among [remote] employees is an inadequate workspace,\u201d says Tara Lopez, Benefits Manager at Konnect Agency, where she manages work-from-home privileges for a company of more than 40 tri-coastal employees. \u201cWhen people think about working from home, they often envision staying in their pajamas and being on their couch. While there are certainly moments where that can be the case, this can also lead to blurred lines of when the mind is supposed to be at ease versus active. I always encourage employees to create a space that is dedicated to work, just as an office would be. This can help many remote workers [determine] where they can and cannot be productive. For employees with limited space in their household, even something as simple as a folding table and chair can make a world of difference in avoiding the lure of working in bed.\u201d\n\n6. Stick to a set schedule for work/life balance ease\n\nIf your boss doesn\u2019t require set hours, implement them yourself. This too will help in creating boundaries.\n\n\u201cA major risk with remote working is that it bleeds into your non-work life. Set primary working hours and stick to them,\u201d says Jono Bacon, a community strategist and the author if \"The Art of Community: Building the New Age of Participation\". \u201cSure, if you need to check-in on an evening, or if a work emergency crops up, tend to it, but focus [on using down time] for you, your family and your hobbies.\u201d\n\n7. Slack it up\n\nMost companies with remote teams use Slack or a similar cloud-based collaboration service. Don\u2019t be shy to stay super connected with co-workers via this service.\n\n\u201cSlack is an awesome tool. I send virtual updates and requests via Slack, and it's a casual conversational channel that makes it easy to check in with your boss once in a while and let them know you're still doing your job and getting results,\u201d says Rachel Go, a remote content strategist and inbound marketer. \u201cYou can also use Slack to highlight any \u2018wins\u2019 on your end. For example, I handle a lot of content exchanges. When a blog post I've written on behalf of a client goes live, I'll send the link along via Slack.\u201d\n\n8. After work, \u201cgo home\u201d (even if you\u2019re home)\n\n\u201cWhen I stop working, I clear my desk, turn off my computer and \u2018go home\u2019 by changing my clothes and leaving the office for the evening,\u201d says Phil La Duke, a remote global business consultant and author. \u201cThere is a real danger of working yourself to the point of fatigue and one way of transitioning from work life to home life is to change the atmosphere. Having a working from home wardrobe that is different from your other wardrobe is a surprisingly effective way to make this transition.\u201d\n\n9. Download apps that block out internet distractions\n\nRebecca Safier, founder, Remote Bliss, champions anti-procrastination apps as a great productivity hack for remote workers.\n\n\u201cThe Checky app, for instance, tracks how much time you\u2019re spending on your phone, so you can become more aware of your habit of scrolling through Instagram when you should be working,\u201d Safier says. \u201cThe Focus and Freedom apps actually block certain websites (Facebook, Pinterest, etc.) for a designated amount of time so you can get work done. Sites like Strict Workflow help you structure your time with the Pomodoro method, a time management technique that has you divide your time into 25-minute sessions of deep focus with breaks in-between. Experiment with different techniques.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt the end of each week, send your boss an email letting her know what you accomplished this week and what you hope to accomplish the next,\u201d says Price. \u201cThe check-in can ensure all your wonderful accomplishments don\u2019t go unnoticed and can make sure both you and your boss are on the same page moving forward.\u201d\n\nWorking remote can be tough. Speak up if you\u2019re struggling\n\nIf you\u2019re new to working remote, it can take time to adjust. You may struggle in the beginning, and ultimately decide that you\u2019d rather work among your colleagues in a shared setting.\n\n\u201cRemote work is not for everyone \u2014 it requires extreme focus, independence and reliability,\u201d says Mady Peterson, content marketing manager at Limeade who works remotely. \u201cIf you thrive in a busy environment and require social interaction to get through the day, it\u2019s possible you\u2019ll struggle.\u201d\n\nGive it some time and consider the aforementioned tips which are all essentially ways of making your home-work life more like an office-work life. If you\u2019re feeling left out or burned out, speak up to your supervisor.\n\n\u201cKeep consistent and transparent communication with your manager to let them know how you\u2019re doing \u2014 both professionally and personally,\u201d says Peterson. \u201cFind what works best for you. When you\u2019re happy, it\u2019ll show in your performance \u2014 and being a happy, engaged employee is what your company wants.\u201d\n\nGET MORE CAREER ADVICE\n\nWant more tips like these?

Roberts suggests making a checklist of all the places you want to clean, so you don\u2019t forget any of them. But commercial disinfecting products contain \u201cpretty serious chemicals,\u201d she warned. \u201cThey're actually EPA registered pesticides, so as much as you can, try to use them when kids are not around because they can trigger asthma.\u201d\n\nThe demand for disinfecting wipes may be outstripping supply right now, but there are many other products you can use. In fact, you may already have some of them at home.\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency has a list of those that meet its criteria for use against the novel coronavirus. The CDC website also has recommendations for households with suspected or confirmed coronavirus cases.\n\nHere\u2019s what you need to know about what will and won\u2019t work against the coronavirus \u2014 according to experts.\n\nSoap and water\n\nIt\u2019s not fancy, but soap and water work. The soap removes the viral particles that have attached themselves to surfaces \u2014 whether it\u2019s your hands, face or countertops \u2014 and suspends them in the water, so they can be washed away.\n\nRichard Sachleben, an organic chemist and a member of the American Chemical Society, said most of the cleaning products we call soap are actually detergents that not only remove the germs from surfaces, but also kill them.\n\n\u201cThe virus has an outside coating, and the stuff inside \u2014 DNA or RNA \u2014 is what actually causes the disease. It's kind of like the casing on a bomb or torpedo,\u201d Sachleben explained. \u201cFor a virus, that coating is a protein, and the soap or detergent break up that coating, so the virus spills its guts and falls apart.\u201d\n\nBleach solution\n\n\u201cBleach is very effective at killing the coronavirus, as well as virtually every other germ on the face of the planet,\u201d said Dr. Paul Pottinger, a professor of infectious diseases at the University of Washington Medical Center. \u201cThe problem is, it\u2019s stinky, it\u2019s hard to use and it can damage what you\u2019re trying to clean.\u201d\n\nTo protect your skin, you should wear gloves when using bleach \u2014 and don\u2019t mix the bleach with anything but water. Here\u2019s the CDC formula for making a diluted bleach solution: Use 5 tablespoons (1/3 cup) of bleach in one gallon of water or 4 teaspoons of bleach in one quart of water. This solution will lose its effectiveness in about 24 hours, so you\u2019ll have to make a new batch every day.\n\nGet the better newsletter. This site is protected by recaptcha\n\nKeep in mind that bleach is a harsh cleaner. So if you go this route, do a little test before you clean an entire surface with your homemade bleach solution. Be careful not to let it splash onto anything else. Bleach can also damage some paint, and over time, it can corrode metal. So be cautious if you use it, Sachleben told NBC News BETTER.\n\nHydrogen peroxide\n\nHydrogen peroxide is not as strong as bleach, so it\u2019s less likely to cause damage, but it can discolor some fabrics, Sachleben said. Don\u2019t dilute it, use it straight. Hydrogen peroxide decomposes into water and oxygen.\n\nAlcohol\n\nRubbing alcohol products that are at least 70 percent alcohol will kill the coronavirus with less potential for damage than bleach. When using rubbing alcohol, don\u2019t dilute it. Consumer Reports says rubbing alcohol is safe for all surfaces, but can discolor some plastics.\n\nDon\u2019t count on distilled white vinegar or vodka\n\nMany people clean with vinegar. It\u2019s cheap and natural. Cleaning recommendations are easy to find online, but Consumer Reports cautions: \u201cThere is no evidence that they are effective against coronavirus.\u201d\n\nDespite what you may have seen on social media, vodka is not effective at sanitizing, nor are any other types of distilled spirits.\n\n\u201cPlease, do not use vodka to clean your surfaces,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cThe concentration of alcohol in vodka is not high enough to kill viruses.\u201d\n\nTito\u2019s Handmade Vodka tweeted a warning that its vodka is only 40 percent alcohol, and therefore, \u201cdoes not meet the current recommendation of the CDC\u201d that hand sanitizer needs to contain at least 60 percent alcohol.\n\nProper technique: A quick swipe isn\u2019t good enough\n\n\u201cTo decontaminate a surface, you can\u2019t just swipe it, you\u2019ve got to scrub it, really scrub it until the entire surface is wet, and then let it dry on its own,\u201d Pottinger said. \u201cThe elbow grease and force that you put into the cleaning process can really pay dividends. You've got to physically wipe away the grime. The antiseptic agent is the additional measure of security that any virus left behind will be killed.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s critically important to use enough of the disinfectant and give it time to work. Here\u2019s how Clorox says to disinfect hard, nonporous surfaces with its wipes: \u201cUse enough wipes for treated surface to remain visibly wet for 4 minutes. Let surface dry.\u201d\n\nBeware of hucksters selling bogus products\n\nThere is no treatment or cure for COVID-19, but that hasn\u2019t stopped people from trying to sell them.\n\nLast week, the Food and Drug Administration and the Federal Trade Commission sent warning letters to seven companies for selling \u201cfraudulent\u201d COVID-19 products. The companies were told their products are \u201cunapproved drugs that pose significant risks to patient health and violate federal law.\u201d\n\nOne of those warning letters was sent to \u201cThe Jim Bakker Show.\u201d In mid-February, the disgraced televangelist promoted a potential cure called \u201cSilver Solution\u201d that contained colloidal silver. The FDA had previously warned that colloidal silver \u201cis not safe or effective for treating any disease or condition.\u201d\n\nShould you consider making your own hand sanitizer?\n\nIt\u2019s easy to go online and find advice about how to make your own hand sanitizer. So, is this a good idea? Opinions vary. The World Health Organization and Consumer Reports advises against it.\n\n\u201cMost of the experts that we've talked to have said this is not the best idea,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cYou may not get the concentrations right. And if your solution doesn't have a high enough concentration of alcohol, it won't be doing you any good.\u201d\n\nSachleben also has concerns about DIY hand sanitizer recipes. He\u2019s a chemist and even he said he doesn\u2019t mix his own disinfectant products at home. \u201cYou\u2019ll never know what you\u2019re doing is as good as what you can buy at the store,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you buy it, you know it'll work.\u201d\n\nSwartzberg believes that doing something is ultimately better than doing nothing, but he worries that DIY hand sanitizers might give people a false sense of security. \u201cI\u2019m concerned people will not prepare it with the correct percentage of alcohol,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople may be fooling themselves into thinking that they\u2019re using something that will help, when it won\u2019t.\u201d\n\nRemember: Alcohol-based hand sanitizers are not as effective when our hands are visibly dirty or greasy. That's why it's important to wash with soap and water.\n\nMoisturize your hands\n\nWith increased handwashing and sanitizing, your hands may get dry and start to crack. Those cracks give germs a place to hide. It\u2019s important to use a good moisturizer to prevent that from happening.\n\nConsumer Reports recommends products that contain ceramides (oils), dimethicone (a type of silicone) and shea butter, which help provide a good seal on the skin. \u201cThe thicker the better,\u201d they say. Greasy ointments, such as petroleum jelly, form a stronger barrier than creams and lotions.\n\nMORE CLEANING TIPS\n\nWant more tips like these?

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nThis article will be updated regularly.\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic has sparked a rush for private companies to offer ways for people to test themselves for the virus from their own homes.\n\nBut there's a lot of empty claims, hype and scams that consumers need to beware of \u2014 as well as crucial information that will help understand them how and why to avoid these fake tests.\n\nThe most important thing to know is that the FDA has not yet approved any at-home diagnostic tests for the coronavirus. There are also no at-home antibody tests currently approved by the FDA.\n\nThe FDA has authorized three at-home collection kits and issued guidance on the development of such kits.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at how tests work, and what you need to know about them.\n\nHow do coronavirus tests work?\n\nMost U.S. coronavirus tests require a swab taken from the back of the nasal cavity or the throat, which is then tested for the presence of the virus\u2019s RNA. A positive result means that person is currently infected with the virus.\n\nThese tests are done by public health labs as well as major commercial labs that can conduct large-scale testing.\n\nSaliva can also be used to test for coronavirus, though only one test thus far \u2014 from Rutgers University \u2014 has received an FDA emergency approval.\n\nA different kind of test determines whether someone has previously been infected with the coronavirus. Called serological tests, these look for blood antibodies \u2014 proteins produced by the immune system\u2019s response to the virus.\n\nSome companies are pushing at-home sample collection, in which people swab themselves and then send their sample in to get tested in a lab. This method can work, but can be prone to error because samples can easily be collected incorrectly or tainted during shipping.\n\nWhat about at-home test kits?\n\nMany companies have touted that they are working on at-home kits, but they should be viewed with scrutiny, particularly since none have been approved by the FDA yet.\n\nLet our news meet your inbox. The news and stories that matters, delivered weekday mornings. This site is protected by recaptcha\n\nFull coverage of the coronavirus outbreak\n\nSome companies have worked to create kits that allow people to swab themselves at home and then mail their sample to a lab that can process their test. This type of kit is an at-home collection kit, not an at-home diagnostic test. In early May, the FDA released new guidelines for developing at-home collection kits, opening the door to more companies to develop such kits.\n\nThe FDA has issued three emergency use approvals for at-home collection kits. The first was issued to LabCorp in April. Another was issued to Everlywell, Inc. in May. Both kits use nasal swabs to collect samples.\n\nIn May, the agency issued an EUA for the diagnostic test from Rutgers Clinical Genomics Laboratory in New Jersey that uses saliva, rather than a nasal swab, and has an option for at-home sample collection. That kit is being marketed by health startup Hims & Hers.\n\nWhat about antibody tests?\n\nSerological tests use small amounts of blood, usually from a finger prick, to test whether a person was previously infected with the coronavirus by looking for antibodies.\n\nAntibodies are created by the human immune system to fight off foreign invaders, like the coronavirus. A positive result does not mean a person is currently infected; it can only tell whether someone was infected in the past.\n\nAnd because it takes the body several days after being infected to develop antibodies, a test given too early could come back negative, even if someone has the virus.\n\nDownload the NBC News app for full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak\n\nAntibody tests are still in development, though some companies have made outlandish claims. The FDA said in a recent statement that more than 70 test developers have told the agency they have serological tests available, but warned that many of these developers are falsely claiming their products have FDA approval or authorization.\n\nIn early May, the FDA walked back its initial policy of allowing antibody tests to be disseminated without providing proof of their accuracy.\n\nCurrently 11 companies have an FDA-approved serological test for coronavirus, though they are not for at-home testing.\n\nAntibody tests could become increasingly important as localities try to figure out just how much of its population has already been infected \u2014 and how many could still be susceptible to the virus.\n\nConsumers should beware of tests that have not been approved by the FDA. In late May, the FDA published a list of more than two dozen tests that had not filed the necessary applications.\n\nHow does the FDA fit in here?\n\nThe FDA is the governmental body that oversees testing, which falls under its edict of regulating medical devices.\n\nFDA approval for new tests can take months and even years, Wroblewski said.\n\nBut in emergency situations, such as the coronavirus pandemic, the FDA can issue \"emergency use authorizations,\" in which the process is sped up.\n\nWhat about claims of FDA approval?\n\nThe FDA has issued more than 60 approvals for tests for the detection of the virus and one approval for an antibody test as of April 21. Most of these approvals have been given to major testing companies and university labs. These are labs where collected samples can be properly tested.\n\nNone of those companies have been approved for at-home diagnostic testing, and only one \u2014 the LabCorp kit \u2014 has received approval for at-home sample collection.", "link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/what-you-need-know-about-coronavirus-testing-kits-n1181141", "published": "2020-05-22T12:46:12+00:00", "author": ["Jason Abbruzzese", "Jason Abbruzzese Is The Senior Editor For Technology News At Nbc News Digital.", "Sara G.

You'll probably be immune \u2014 for some time, at least", "text": "Those who recover from the coronavirus are probably not going to catch it again, at least in the short term, experts say. But it's unclear how long that immunity will last.\n\n\"It is reasonable to predict we will have some immunity. To say you will have lifelong immunity? We just don\u2019t know yet,\" said Frances Lund, professor and chair of the department of microbiology at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. \"But I think it\u2019s a reasonable conclusion that you will have immunity for the rest of this season.\"\n\nThe key to immunity lies in the antibodies produced by people who have recovered from COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.\n\nAntibodies are proteins in the bloodstream that attack foreign intruders, such as viruses and bacteria. Those produced in response to the coronavirus may one day help guide public health measures, such as signaling when it is safe for a person to end social distancing. They are also being explored as a treatment for critically ill patients whose own antibodies are not enough to fight off the virus.\n\nMore research is needed in both of those areas, but in the meantime, top health officials have expressed confidence that coronavirus antibodies are likely able to prevent a person who had the infection from getting sick with it a second time.\n\n\"I feel really confident that if this virus acts like every other virus that we know, once you get infected, get better, clear the virus, then you will have immunity that will protect you against reinfection.\"\n\n\"We don't know that for 100 percent certain because we haven't done the study,\" Dr. Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told \"The Daily Show\" host Trevor Noah last week. \"But I feel really confident that if this virus acts like every other virus that we know, once you get infected, get better, clear the virus, then you will have immunity that will protect you against reinfection.\"\n\nFull coverage of the coronavirus outbreak\n\nLet our news meet your inbox. The news and stories that matters, delivered weekday mornings. This site is protected by recaptcha\n\nWhether that protection will be long term depends on a number of factors, experts say.\n\nThe first is whether the virus mutates. If it stays stable, those who have had it have a high chance of being able to \"stop it at the door\" if they are exposed to it a second time because the antibodies in their blood will recognize it and prevent it from replicating in their bodies, Lund said.\n\nBut the coronavirus is an RNA virus, meaning its genetic material is made up of RNA, not DNA. And RNA viruses have a tendency to mutate over time: Seasonal influenza, another RNA virus, usually changes from year to year.\n\n\"That\u2019s why every year, there's a new vaccine for the flu,\" said Dr. Tim Schacker, an infectious disease doctor and vice dean for research at the University of Minnesota's medical school. \"Influenza has been here forever; you're making antibodies to some parts of the virus all the time, but it's the novel parts of the virus that you want to have antibodies to.\"\n\nSince this \"coronavirus is a brand new virus,\" Schacker said, everyone is vulnerable to every part of it.\n\nThe other factor in avoiding reinfection is how good the antibodies are that people are making against the coronavirus. Humans almost always make antibodies when exposed to a virus. But not every antibody is powerful enough to block a virus from infecting cells again \u2014 and scientists have yet to discover whether the coronavirus antibodies are high-quality ones.\n\n\"Do they neutralize the virus, which means binds to a very specific place on the virus that will prevent the virus from attaching to the cell it would normally infect?\" Lund said.\n\nEven if the antibodies are capable of this, the immunity they provide could wane over time.\n\n\"Because this is so new, it's hard to predict what's going to happen,\" said Joel Baines, a virologist at Louisiana State University. \"There's going to be a period of immunity, and it could be as little as eight months to a year, and as long as several years.\"\n\n\"All of that is in your garden variety infection. We just don't know yet what's going to happen with this infection.\"\n\nThis period is called immunologic memory, Schacker said, and is dependent upon the plasma cells that make antibodies dividing and staying in your blood for some time.\n\n\"So if you get re-exposed to that pathogen, and you have a sufficient number of cells to make antibodies, then you are protected from reinfection,\" he said. \"But all of that is in your garden variety infection. We just don't know yet what's going to happen with this infection.\"\n\nDownload the NBC News app for full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak\n\nThere are hopeful signs about the quality of the coronavirus antibodies that the body makes.

But nothing could have prepared them for the drop they experienced because of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nIn late February, as the outbreak worsened, gyms took steps to protect customers, such as limiting class sizes and ramping up cleaning procedures. By mid-March, local ordinances started forcing many to close their doors as sweat-laden, shared surfaces meant increased risk of spreading COVID-19.\n\nWhile some gyms continued to collect membership fees, most quickly lost all revenue. Some eventually pivoted to digital and started offering live-streamed workouts. But most were offered for free or directed donations to their instructors.\n\nIn President Donald Trump's guidelines announced this week for reopening the country, gyms were included in the first phase, \"if they adhere to strict physical distancing and sanitation protocols.\"\n\nCrunch CEO Jim Rowley said the company gave money to the International Health, Racquet & Sportsclub Association to help with its efforts to lobby for the inclusion of gyms in phase one. Both Crunch and the association were surprised to learn gyms had actually been included when the guidelines were released.\n\n\"It was probably the first time I'd smiled in 30 days,\" he said. \"It was the first time gyms have been mentioned, and we were mentioned in phase one.

There will also be additions like vinyl arrows on the floor to direct the flow of traffic and grids taped on studio floors to ensure people stay in their spots throughout classes. Equipment like treadmills will be placed six feet apart.\n\n\"I'm a former Marine and as we reemerge, I\u2019ve really been focusing our team on how do we come out of this stronger, what can we take from this experience,\" he said. \"This is the way we want to do things into perpetuity. This won\u2019t be the last virus, but we can create these good habits.\"\n\nEquinox is also focused on ensuring that customers are safe whenever they return. The chain had already upped its cleaning and disinfecting processes before closing but has since been \"extensively\" researching and implementing additional safety measures.\n\n\"We have set up a dedicated task force that is responsible for working with leading medical experts on a thoughtful and comprehensive plan that goes above and beyond the guidelines of health organizations,\" said Equinox Group Executive Chairman Harvey Spevak.\n\nHelaine Knapp, founder and CEO of CityRow, said she's \"conservatively optimistic\" about reopening.\n\n\"I\u2019m excited, but we\u2019re going to move as conservatively as possible,\" she said. \"We'll stay at the maximum protective level for our clients and staff even if that means reduced potential for revenue.\"\n\nCityRow has eleven existing studios and three in the works across 10 states, including California, New York, Texas and Florida.\n\nGiven that governors will decide when to reopen their states, it's unclear when all of CityRow's studios will be back in action, but Knapp said she would prioritize the most cautious guidance.\n\nShe said the guidelines \"are very broad\" and don't contain many specifics, but she feels \"well-positioned\" to reopen because CityRow's classes are already small, rowers keep the same machine for the entire class, and studios are thoroughly and regularly cleaned.\n\nThere may be some adjustments like offering classes at half-capacity to start, and each location will be treated differently depending on where the city is in the process of containing the outbreak.\n\nCityRow closed its locations on March 15, which Knapp said was \"really tough\" because it had been her baby since she was 25. But she did have one advantage over most studios. In 2018, she launched CityRowGo, an arm of the business that sells in-home rowers and is built around an on-demand app. That side of the business has grown steadily since mid-March.\n\nKnapp also had the foresight to film 10 workouts with CityRow instructors days before she was forced to close her studios. Those videos bought her team time before they were ready to offer live workouts.\n\nThe new offerings might not continue after the outbreak, but they've been helpful in the interim as a smaller source of revenue. While online classes are much cheaper than studio classes, the cushion means there's less pressure to rush reopening.\n\n\"The biggest thing we\u2019re going to do is listen: to officials, to studios and to clients,\" she said. \"Ultimately, everyone wants to work out together, but if we go too early, our customers won\u2019t feel good about it.\"", "link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/gyms-are-eager-reopen-are-they-safe-n1186721", "published": "2020-04-20T13:26:23+00:00", "author": ["Ahiza Garc\u00eda-Hodges", "Ahiza Garc\u00eda-Hodges Covers The Intersection Of Media", "Tech", "Sports"]}, {"title": "Higher fares, longer waits, no booze: How coronavirus will change the way we fly", "text": "Higher ticket prices, temperature checks before boarding, and no inflight alcohol: Airline travel in the post-coronavirus era will look very different from the low-cost \"getaway\" trips of the past \u2014 and you should probably pack your lunch.\n\nAirlines are keen to see passenger volume return, and have been making significant changes to prevent the spread of the disease.

What we are certain of \u2014 whether seeing Times Square in New York City deserted or the Piazza San Marco in Venice, Italy, devoid even of peanut-seeking pigeons \u2014 is that tourism, which represents an estimated 10 percent of gross domestic product and 1 in 10 jobs globally, has been horrifically damaged.\n\nYet given the scale of COVID-19's devastation already \u2014 over 5 million confirmed cases and over 330,000 deaths worldwide at time of publishing \u2014 it seems clear that memorials will almost assuredly be erected to commemorate our dead. And, even more clearly, those memorials will become tourist destinations in and of themselves.\n\nVisiting sites associated with mass death is so common that academics have a name for it: thanatourism, from Thanatos, the Greek god of death. Though, industry people generally refer to it as either \"dark\" or, more commonly, \"death\" tourism. It encompasses everything from locations where war and mass killings reshaped the physical environment \u2014 including the various Nazi death camps (including Auschwitz in Poland and Dachau in Germany), Cambodia\u2019s Killing Fields or New York\u2019s Ground Zero \u2014 to cemeteries, crypts and catacombs, as well memorials and museums built for the purpose of remembrance.\n\nGet the think newsletter. This site is protected by recaptcha\n\nMemorials, museums or sites dedicated to victims of diseases that killed thousands or millions are perhaps the most rare, but they do exist. There are examples from the Black Death in Europe, whether hospitals where people were treated for the plague or the endless catacombs where victims were buried en masse. In New York City, there is already a little-known monument to pestilence: the haunting Smallpox Hospital ruins on Roosevelt Island.\n\nThere is also the better-known New York City AIDS Memorial, of which triangles are the overriding theme, deliberately evoking the upside-down pink triangles used by the Nazis to denote gay people imprisoned in concentration camps and later reclaimed by the LGBTQ rights movement. Situated on a triangular intersection in Manhattan\u2019s Greenwich Village, the memorial opened in 2016 to honor all who died from AIDS-related illnesses in the city \u2014 men, women and children. But in the early days of the AIDS epidemic, gay men made up the most visible of the people who had the disease, and few places in the world were as radically transformed by it as Greenwich Village.\n\nThe thousands of deaths emptied out apartments in the area where the memorial now sits, making them ready to be occupied by new residents \u2014 a process that helped jumpstart the eventual luxury transformation of a once-bohemian district. Few better examples of that transformation exist than the memorial itself, originally designed to be in view of St. Vincent\u2019s Hospital, where many gay men (and other people) died after contracting a disease other hospitals refused to treat. The hospital closed in 2010, before the memorial ever opened; luxury condos replaced it.\n\nHong Kong, where SARS \u2014 another coronavirus that, like COVID-19, originated in China \u2014 was intensely dangerous, has a space dedicated to understanding the importance of information during pandemics. In 2003, SARS essentially shut down Hong Kong and the surrounding Guangdong province; anyone who caught it had a roughly 15 percent chance of dying, which rose to 50 percent for older adults. Though Hong Kong had a fraction of the population of China and about one-third of the cases, it had nearly the same number of deaths \u2014 a horror permanently seared into the region\u2019s memory and detailed in Hong Kong\u2019s historical museums.\n\nIn the new Hong Kong News-Expo, a museum dedicated to journalism that opened in 2018, there is a permanent exhibition dedicated to \"Information vs. Epidemics,\" examining mainland China\u2019s suppression of information on the emerging disease and how a free press in Hong Kong had a greater ability to write on its spread.\n\nPerhaps few cities in the world were so transformed by disease as Buenos Aires, Argentina, when epidemics caused by yellow fever, cholera and other illnesses in the late 1800s created a north-south economic divide that still exists, as the wealthy fled the crowded old colonial districts along the R\u00edo de la Plata, building new mansions on the city\u2019s once-rural northern edges. An exquisite remnant of this period is the water palace, a former water pumping station designed to mimic these new abodes while supplying clean water to the city. It\u2019s now home to a historical exhibit \u2014 sometimes called the \"toilet museum\" by locals \u2014 which serves as a paean to the importance of water sanitation and urban planning in public health and disease prevention.\n\nGiven all of this \u2014 and what may be a pent-up desire for people to see the world again when and if the pandemic is brought under control \u2014 it's interesting to consider how the physical sites associated with COVID-19 will be preserved, catalogued and memorialized. In Wuhan, will the wet market that is thought to be the origin of this disease be preserved with explanatory plaques as cautionary tales? Will the sites of the temporary hospitals around the world for the thousands who became sick or died become memorial parks where we can walk and remember them?\n\nMany tourism experts will likely make the usual recommendations for recovery in the aftermath of the coronavirus, wishing for a return to normal \u2014 as if the virus and its disruption had never happened. Instead, we must incorporate the story of the coronavirus into our tourism narratives, remembering those who died from the illness and its impact on our lives.\n\nTourism is not just beaches and pools and happy stories of sun-tanned travelers; it is also about the exploration of our history, including the ways in which it was shaped by death, disease and other disasters.

The social media giant paid an estimated $6.5 million to reach nearly a quarter billion people with the ad, according to advertising analytics firm iSpot.tv.

The photos in the ads were mocked up as posts in the group.\n\nA Facebook spokesperson said the images, which included photos of Toronto grocery workers and nurse anesthetists in Tampa, Florida, had been licensed.

To work within the constraints of Covid-19, we consulted with the group's admin and used content that mirrors real activity happening in this Facebook Group.\"\n\nInstead of using actual posts from the group, Facebook relied on mocking up posts that captured \u201cthe spirit of the group,\u201d the spokesperson said, and the names of Facebook employees were used for privacy concerns.\n\nFacebook has been criticized for other deceptive public relations campaigns in the last year, including a glowing profile of five female Facebook employees in Teen Vogue that turned out to be unidentified sponsored content and dozens of uncritical paid-for articles in the British newspaper the Daily Telegraph.\n\nIt\u2019s common for companies to use actors or stock photos in advertisements, of course. And Facebook is hardly the only brand to unveil commercials with sweeping coronavirus themes.\n\nBut, some say there remains a line between ads that play on viewers' emotions and those that are deceptive. Erin Schauster, an assistant professor at University of Colorado Boulder\u2019s College of Media, Communication and Information, said that the lack of disclosures in Facebook's ad are problematic.\n\n\u201cThe advertising is essentially misleading,\u201d she said.\n\nSchauster suggested the ad might include a disclaimer, like the \u201cactor portrayal,\u201d labels used by pharmaceutical companies for doctor testimonials, but hedged even there, saying a label might not go far enough.\n\nThe pandemic has understandably led advertisers at Facebook and elsewhere to alter their processes, facing new restrictions on travel, access to talent and content.\n\n\u201cWe can expect processes to change, but it's still not a path to intend to deceive,\u201d Schauster said.\n\nAs public health concerns have forced people to spend more time in their homes and thus online, the coronavirus has provided Facebook with a unique opportunity to grow its user engagement. The company has seized on an 11 percent year-over-year jump in daily active users to roll out new features such as meeting rooms and shops.\n\nThe coronavirus has also given Facebook a chance to burnish its image, which has been hit by years of privacy and data scandals, rampant political and health misinformation on its platform, and Russian interference in the 2016 election.\n\nIn response to the coronavirus, Facebook has made large donations to news organizations, relief efforts and frontline workers while promoting reputable information sources like the World Health Organization.\n\nFacebook\u2019s coronavirus ads have primarily promoted groups, focused on feel-good subjects including cheering the frontline, or sewing face masks, or parenting under quarantine. The ads include the tagline \u201cMoreTogether,\u201d and one specific to its coronavirus ads, \u201cEspecially Now.\u201d\n\nBut critics have warned groups can be hubs for conspiracy theories and dangerous health misinformation. In the last few months, extremists have used the groups feature to organize protests against stay-at-home orders.

The workers have adapted to the pandemic, learning new protocols and infection control regimens and wearing new types of protective equipment, he said.\n\nOlga Jarr\u00edn, a registered nurse and assistant professor in nursing science at Rutgers University, said there is often a lack of public awareness about what home care is and who can benefit from it. \u201cIt can be so many different things,\u201d she said.\n\nThere are \u201cthree big buckets\u201d of home care, Jarr\u00edn said: the short-term, immediate care a person may receive after they leave a hospital and need additional treatment; monitoring and management of a chronic illness over time; and palliative care.\n\nHome care also includes a broad range of medical and personal services for people who need assistance in the home. That can include help with daily living needs, such as services provided by a home health aide, as well as medical needs provided by medical professionals, such as nurses or therapists.\n\nHome care can include personal daily tasks such as help with medications, bathing and turning to prevent bed sores. It can also include medical care such as taking care of wounds, administering infusions and injections, providing physical therapy, managing and monitoring vital signs and other medical interventions.\n\nVicki Hoak, executive director of the Home Care Association of America, said the coronavirus pandemic has \u201cabsolutely changed the face of home care\u201d and \u201cupended everything about our daily operations.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s caused us all to think about our mission, the way we deliver the care, the way we communicate and how we\u2019re regarded by other partners in the health care communities,\u201d she said. \"My hope is that absolutely more light has been shed on this valuable workforce.\"\n\nHome care employees are also critical front-line workers in the fight against coronavirus, Hoak said, and face similar issues hospitals face, such as the initial lack of life-saving personal protective equipment. Such equipment is essential to protect patients the home care workers serve every day and to protect themselves, she said.\n\nLet our news meet your inbox.

This has been the fastest-growing need for home care services,\u201d she said. \u201cI think we\u2019re going to see a tremendous growth.\u201d\n\nWarren Hebert, chief executive officer of the HomeCare Association of Louisiana, said he also believed there would be increased skilled nursing in the home setting, as well as more community-based services and more palliative and hospice care in the home.\n\nHebert said families might begin seeking out additional home care options and maintaining independent living at home following reports of how coronavirus spread widely in nursing homes and other facilities. According to data collected by NBC News, at least one-third of the 90,000 known coronavirus deaths in the United States are linked to nursing homes and other long-term care facilities.\n\n\u201cI think that we\u2019re going to see families thinking much harder and having much more conversation about whether that\u2019s the right choice or not,\u201d he said.\n\nHebert said in light of the pandemic and fears of infectious diseases, going forward \u201cwe need to be more intentional about the way we go about building the relationship between the health care provider and the patient and the patient\u2019s family.\u201d\n\nSome families have been refusing home visits from a nurse or therapist because of those fears, he said, so it was critical for providers to communicate protocols and ensure the safety of their patients.\n\n\u201cThat home health nurse needs to find the way to build trust and confidence with the patient and their family,\u201d he said. \u201cIf that nurse can help to manage the person\u2019s chronic illness well, then it keeps them out of the hospital or an urgent care center or the emergency department.\u201d\n\nRoger Noyes, director of communications for the Home Care Association of New York State, said the \u201cpandemic has really required all sectors of health care to rethink everything.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor home care, that includes everything from basic supply issues to the role of technology in providing care,\u201d he said.\n\nNoyes said in New York City, home care providers have long employed telehealth monitoring and a range of telecommunication systems that have been important in keeping patients safe during a pandemic.\n\nBut to date, Noyes said, that has not been covered by Medicare.\n\nDownload the NBC News app for full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak\n\n\u201cSo, it\u2019s really important for the federal government to follow the trend on where telehealth is going and the need to reimagine elder care services in a way that employs telehealth systems to help patients at home,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re finding that telehealth is vital for reducing exposure in a time of crisis like this.\u201d\n\nBeyond medical services, video technology is providing much-needed mental and social services during a time when so many have been isolated from their loved ones, Noyes said.\n\nNoyes said they have received a grant to work with a home care agency called Selfhelp Community Services in New York City to build an onlinesenior center with interactive, video-based live classes for home care providers to offer their patients statewide. It will provide older adults a chance to interact with each other while learning about a variety of topics such as music, history and the arts through partnerships with institutions such as museums.\n\nSelfhelp's Virtual Senior Center. Selfhelp\n\n\"Everyone who is experiencing this crisis knows that social Isolation is a way of life right now for all of us to some degree, and we also know technology has become a major bridge for that type of connectivity we yearn for in this moment of crisis,\" Noyes said.\n\nRussell Lusak, Selfhelp\u2019s chief operating officer, said the virtual senior center provided social interaction for older adults during a time of extreme social isolation and depression.\n\n\u201cThat connection to other people is so important,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a great option for people that otherwise wouldn\u2019t have the ability to go to a senior center.
